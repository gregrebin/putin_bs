President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr President, Dear Chinese friends,
Allow me once more, now in enlarged format, to welcome you all to the capital of Russia.
We see the visit of the President of the People’s Republic of China to Russia as a key event in bilateral relations this year. At present, essentially all major political issues between our countries have been solved, and thus for a long period of time a solid foundation of friendship, trust and cooperation has been laid between Russia and the People’s Republic of China.
Yesterday evening and this morning Mr President and I went through all the issues of our cooperation in painstaking detail, both bilateral cooperation and cooperation on the international stage. And we are very happy to have the opportunity to discuss all these problems with our colleagues at ministerial, departmental level.
As we commence this format of work, addressing all our Chinese friends, I would like to say once more: welcome! We are very happy about your visit to Moscow.
Hu Jintao (translated from Russian): First of all allow me to thank President Vladimir Putin once more for his kind invitation and the opportunity to visit Russia again, and also for the hearty and warm welcome shown to us.
Both yesterday evening and this morning in our talk in a small circle we had a thorough talk, and exchanged opinions in detail on issues of bilateral and international relations.
We agreed unanimously that we must proclaim a Chinese-Russian joint declaration on world order in the 21st century. This document will outline our vision of major issues of international political life. The declaration also reflects our firm will in upholding peace and stability all over the world.
I am prepared, on the basis of what was achieved in our talks in a small circle, to discuss with you, Mr President, and with our Russian friends, issues of further deepening Russian-Chinese partnership and strategic interaction, and on strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries in all directions.
