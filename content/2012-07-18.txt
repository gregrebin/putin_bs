President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, it is a great pleasure to welcome you to Moscow.
Our countries’ bilateral relations have reached a very high level over these last years thanks to our common efforts, and perhaps above all thanks to your efforts, Mr Prime Minister. It is enough to say that our bilateral trade increased by 25 percent last year and came to $34 billion.
Many Turkish companies are firmly established on the Russian market. We also have effective cooperation in the energy sector, not just in energy sales – Turkey is Russia’s second biggest consumer in this area – but also in hi-tech energy sectors such as nuclear energy. We are actively pursuing big joint projects and working closely together in the region.
We are very pleased to see you and we wish you welcome.
Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan (retranslated): Your Excellency Mr President, this meeting here today is particularly significant, following on from our meeting in Mexico. Today, we have the chance to discuss our cooperation in all the different areas, including the defence industry, political and economic cooperation, trade and cultural ties. 
Our countries do indeed have huge potential. You just noted that our trade reached a figure of $34–35 billion last year. We have especially big opportunities in the energy sector, and our work together in the nuclear energy sector will be one of the biggest investments in the region in recent years.
We are taking this step despite negative attitudes around the world to nuclear energy, but I am sure that if we carry out everything as planned, the completed project will dispel all criticism by those opposed to it.
I express my sincere thanks for today’s opportunity. Thank you.
