The beginning of a meeting with Indian President Abdul Kalam

The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr President,
Let me once again offer you a hearty welcome to Moscow. I remember a rather lengthy and detailed conversation we had when I was visiting your country. And quite recently I had the pleasure of receiving the Indian Prime Minister in Moscow who came to attend the celebrations of Victory in World War II. Now we are having an opportunity to exchange information and thoughts on the further development of Russian-Indian relations.
We are happy that high-level contacts have not ended, and, on the contrary, they create a good atmosphere and a good basis for the development of Russian-Indian relations in all spheres.
I am happy to see our Indian friends in Moscow. Welcome, Mr Abdul Kalam!
A.Kalam: Thank you, Your Excellency, Mr Putin.
I have been staying here for two days already, and I would like to thank you for your hospitality. Everything was very well organised.
This morning, I laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was a very touching ceremony.
Mr President, I remember you visiting my home in New Delhi. I mean you were in our presidential palace. I remember we discussed all areas of our cooperation in great detail. Our Prime Minister came here in May for the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War. I remember the death toll of that war, and I know the Soviet people sacrificed their lives for the cause of peace.
Wherever I went, I had useful exchanges of opinion. I held meetings in academies, institutes, and industrial facilities.

The beginning of Russian-Indian talks in extended format
May 24, 2005
18:28
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Mr. President,
Respected colleagues and friends,
Let me once again express my pleasure to be greeting you in the Kremlin in Moscow.
We are very much pleased that the high-level dialogue continues uninterrupted and helps develop our contacts in practically all areas.
Talking to the President in a narrow format just recently, we concluded that our cooperation and plans for its further development were successfully implemented. However, we together, my friends, can do much more. With this in mind, we are happy to be hosting Mr. President and all our Indian friends. I am absolutely confident that this visit will provide an additional impetus to our cooperation.
A.Kalam: Mr. President, I am glad to be in the Kremlin today. I know that the history of five hundred years is concentrated here, that is why it is a big honor for me to be here.
I also enjoyed our meeting this morning. We had very effective negotiations. I believe these negotiations and my meeting with you give us the opportunity to raise our cooperation to a qualitatively new level.
I am very glad that during your visit to New Delhi last December, we signed a framework agreement on space cooperation. It is a very good program. We will launch a large number of satellites. Some of them will be launched in India, and some in Russia. As a result, we will obtain a very good satellite network.
Our meeting also highlighted a very interesting project between Moscow State University, Indian universities and our space organizations.
