President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am very happy to see you and welcome you to Moscow. Very soon, the day after tomorrow, we will mark the 10th anniversary of the Russian Federation’s recognition of the independence of the Republic of South Ossetia.
We all know and remember well what it was about and what difficult events the country went through ten years ago. Nevertheless, despite all the hardships – and there are always many of them – the republic is developing. We are doing our best to ensure the security of the Republic of South Ossetia and to support it economically.
Meeting with President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov.
I would like to note that mutual trade is growing at a good pace, by 24–25 percent. Investment projects are being carried out, including those with Russia’s support. There are some good results, for instance, the construction of a children’s hospital, which. I believe, has opened already, and the republican hospital’s surgical wing. The road network is also expanding. Other areas of our cooperation include housing and utilities projects.
Overall, work is ongoing. There are probably more problems than we have managed to solve. However, our relations are developing and the republic is improving and strengthening its positions.
I would like to congratulate you on the tenth anniversary and wish you and the people of South Ossetia prosperity and wellbeing.
President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov: Thank you, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation on Russian State Flag Day and to thank you for inviting us to Moscow. It is even more significant on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the day when Russia recognised the statehood of the Republic of South Ossetia.
President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov.
I would like to note that the recognition of the Republic of South Ossetia is a historical event for South Ossetia. It was after the peace enforcement operation and recognition of South Ossetia that the people of South Ossetia began living in an entirely different format: the format of stability, peace and prosperity.
Today children in South Ossetia do not shudder from explosions; today the republic is developing. And, of course, we know what an enormous part you personally played in this and what a great political role you played in all the events in South Ossetia. Of course, we are very grateful to you for this.
Meeting with President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov.
As of today, South Ossetia has built tens of thousands of square metres in the social sphere, including education and healthcare. The infrastructure in South Ossetia is expanding. And, of course, we must thank the Russian Federation for this.
I have the great honour to thank you today on behalf of the people of South Ossetia for that fact that the country is peaceful today and that it is developing. Thank you very much.

Meeting with President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba
Vladimir Putin had a separate meeting with President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba following the trilateral meeting with the leaders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

The Kremlin, Moscow
With President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am glad to see you and to welcome you to Moscow.
Together we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the day when Russia recognised the Republic of Abkhazia. It is an important, historical event for the country, which is also significant for the Russian Federation.
I would like to note that over these years many things have changed in our relations. Intergovernmental ties have grown stronger. We consider our cooperation in ensuring the security of Abkhazia very important. This also goes for cooperation between the border services. I believe this work is very effective.
At a meeting with President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
After our previous meeting, when you pointed to certain problems related to the need to increase the capacity at the border, the situation has improved, as we noted during our business lunch. I hope that we will continue to move in this direction, thus strengthening the external perimeter and removing excessive red tape at the checkpoints between Abkhazia and Russia.
We continue promoting our cooperation in the economy and in developing infrastructure. I hope that we will discuss it in detail now.
President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba: Mr President,
Thank you for your invitation.
Meeting with President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
The recognition of our country means that the long-time dream of the Abkhazian people has come true. Of course, it is an important event for us.
Today we can state that over 130 bilateral documents have been signed that help us to resolve issues in various areas, such as the socioeconomic development of Abkhazia, cooperation between law enforcement agencies and in our foreign policy. We are working in coordination with the Russian Foreign Ministry.
There is no doubt that the situation around these issues has changed completely after we signed the Agreement on Alliance and Strategic Partnership. I would like us to work even more intensively on socioeconomic issues, foreign policy and opportunities for defence and security.
Meeting with President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
I hope that our meeting today will help resolve many of these issues.
Thank you.
