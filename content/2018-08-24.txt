President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am very happy to see you and welcome you to Moscow. Very soon, the day after tomorrow, we will mark the 10th anniversary of the Russian Federation’s recognition of the independence of the Republic of South Ossetia.
We all know and remember well what it was about and what difficult events the country went through ten years ago. Nevertheless, despite all the hardships – and there are always many of them – the republic is developing. We are doing our best to ensure the security of the Republic of South Ossetia and to support it economically.
Meeting with President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov.
I would like to note that mutual trade is growing at a good pace, by 24–25 percent. Investment projects are being carried out, including those with Russia’s support. There are some good results, for instance, the construction of a children’s hospital, which. I believe, has opened already, and the republican hospital’s surgical wing. The road network is also expanding. Other areas of our cooperation include housing and utilities projects.
Overall, work is ongoing. There are probably more problems than we have managed to solve. However, our relations are developing and the republic is improving and strengthening its positions.
I would like to congratulate you on the tenth anniversary and wish you and the people of South Ossetia prosperity and wellbeing.
President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov: Thank you, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation on Russian State Flag Day and to thank you for inviting us to Moscow. It is even more significant on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the day when Russia recognised the statehood of the Republic of South Ossetia.
President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov.
I would like to note that the recognition of the Republic of South Ossetia is a historical event for South Ossetia. It was after the peace enforcement operation and recognition of South Ossetia that the people of South Ossetia began living in an entirely different format: the format of stability, peace and prosperity.
Today children in South Ossetia do not shudder from explosions; today the republic is developing. And, of course, we know what an enormous part you personally played in this and what a great political role you played in all the events in South Ossetia. Of course, we are very grateful to you for this.
Meeting with President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov.
As of today, South Ossetia has built tens of thousands of square metres in the social sphere, including education and healthcare. The infrastructure in South Ossetia is expanding. And, of course, we must thank the Russian Federation for this.
I have the great honour to thank you today on behalf of the people of South Ossetia for that fact that the country is peaceful today and that it is developing. Thank you very much.

Meeting with President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba
Vladimir Putin had a separate meeting with President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba following the trilateral meeting with the leaders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
August 24, 2018
14:30
The Kremlin, Moscow
With President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am glad to see you and to welcome you to Moscow.
Together we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the day when Russia recognised the Republic of Abkhazia. It is an important, historical event for the country, which is also significant for the Russian Federation.
I would like to note that over these years many things have changed in our relations. Intergovernmental ties have grown stronger. We consider our cooperation in ensuring the security of Abkhazia very important. This also goes for cooperation between the border services. I believe this work is very effective.
At a meeting with President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
After our previous meeting, when you pointed to certain problems related to the need to increase the capacity at the border, the situation has improved, as we noted during our business lunch. I hope that we will continue to move in this direction, thus strengthening the external perimeter and removing excessive red tape at the checkpoints between Abkhazia and Russia.
We continue promoting our cooperation in the economy and in developing infrastructure. I hope that we will discuss it in detail now.
President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba: Mr President,
Thank you for your invitation.
Meeting with President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
The recognition of our country means that the long-time dream of the Abkhazian people has come true. Of course, it is an important event for us.
Today we can state that over 130 bilateral documents have been signed that help us to resolve issues in various areas, such as the socioeconomic development of Abkhazia, cooperation between law enforcement agencies and in our foreign policy. We are working in coordination with the Russian Foreign Ministry.
There is no doubt that the situation around these issues has changed completely after we signed the Agreement on Alliance and Strategic Partnership. I would like us to work even more intensively on socioeconomic issues, foreign policy and opportunities for defence and security.
Meeting with President of the Republic of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
I hope that our meeting today will help resolve many of these issues.
Thank you.

Working meeting with Mikhail Babich
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Mikhail Babich, who has been appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Russia to Belarus and Special Presidential Representative for Expanding Trade and Economic Cooperation with Belarus.
August 24, 2018
09:45
Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Babich, you are leaving on a mission to Belarus. Obviously, I do not have to tell you about the importance of cooperation with Belarus, which is our main ally and partner. You are aware of how important this work is for Russia.
It is not just a country that Russia shares a border with: we are united by special ties with Belarus, including historical, ethnic, linguistic and economic ties.
Belarus is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and the Eurasian Economic Union. We are also building a unique format in the form of the Union State. Apart from diplomatic and economic work, you will represent the interests of Russia as a special representative. Considering your experience in various senior state posts, I hope that this responsible aspect will be successful in your reliable hands.
We will meet regularly, and you will report on how this work is proceeding. I hope you will have a positive and dynamic influence on all these processes in our interstate relations. I would like to wish you every success.
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Russia to Belarus Mikhail Babich: Thank you very much, Mr President. First of all, thank you for the trust accorded me by this appointment.
As you have said, the Republic of Belarus is, indeed, our most important geopolitical and military ally. Moreover, it is our main economic partner.
In 2017 alone, mutual trade exceeded two trillion rubles. You have set the task of shortly attaining the $50 billion mark.
Of course, Belarus and Russia are fraternal nations. You and the President of Belarus have worked a great deal to build up the Union State, the highest form of integration between Russia and Belarus.
Together with our colleagues from the Russian Government, the Presidential Executive Office and our Belarusian partners, we will now do our best to implement the agreements reached between the heads of state.
You have vested me with powers of the Special Presidential Representative for Trade and Economic Relations. It goes without saying that these powers will make it possible to considerably boost the efficiency of this work. I understand the scale of the tasks that have been set and my personal responsibility, and will do everything to justify your trust.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
I am pleased to welcome you in Moscow. I know that you have already held consultations with your Russian partners in the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry and representatives of special services.
Relations with Turkey are growing deeper and more substantive, not to mention the regular contacts with President Erdogan. I would like to speak about the deepening cooperation in the economy and on resolving a number of regional issues, including urgent ones like the Syrian crisis. Thanks to our countries’ efforts and the involvement of other concerned states, I mean Iran in particular, as well as our cooperation with the United Nations, European countries and the United States, we have made significant progress towards settling the Syrian crisis. I know that you have also discussed other matters of mutual interest today.
I am glad to see you and to hear your assessment of where we are now and what we have to do in the short and longer term to promote our relations.
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (retranslated): Mr President,
First of all, we would like to thank you for receiving us.
Your good friend Mr Erdogan sends his greetings and best regards and expects your visit to Istanbul soon. You have plans to go to a seafood restaurant.
It is true that our relations at the presidential level are very good, and this drives us to promote relations at our level as well. Today our foreign ministers held talks. Our colleagues discussed regional issues at their respective levels. All cooperation matters were discussed. It is very important for us, not only at the state level, but in the regional context as well.
