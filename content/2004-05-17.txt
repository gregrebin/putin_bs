The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Mr Minister, dear colleagues, allow me once again to wish you a warm welcome to Moscow. I am very pleased to see you again, Mr Minister. I recall all our previous meetings, here in Moscow and in other places, and they were always productive and very useful. I am pleased to see that our relations with Iran are developing on the solid basis of the agreement that we signed in 2001. Both sides are keeping to the main principles and the spirit and substance of this agreement. Iran is a longstanding and stable partner for Russia. I must say that we cannot but feel satisfaction at the results of our work. Trade between our two countries has increased by more than 70 percent since 2002. We know that the Iranian leadership places great importance on developing relations with the Russian Federation and this makes us very happy indeed. I would like to ask you to convey my very best wishes to the entire Iranian leadership and to President Khatami.
Kamal Kharrazi: I am very pleased to meet once again with you. Mr Khatami gives you his warmest wishes. Taking this opportunity, I would like to congratulate you on your victory in the presidential election. I also would like to express my condolences for the death of President Kadyrov.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Kamal Kharrazi: It is good to see that relations between Russia and Iran are developing positively. This is a result of the policies pursued by the leaderships in our two countries. Russia and Iran can cooperate not just at a bilateral level but also on international and regional issues.
