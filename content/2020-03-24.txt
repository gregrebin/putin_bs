President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
This morning, I discussed with some of you the epidemiological situation in the country, specifically in Moscow and its environs. We spoke about additional measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Meanwhile, I asked you here today to discuss measures to support the economy. You are aware that, unfortunately, this pandemic is having a negative affect on the global economy, including the leading world economies. One way or another it is affecting our country, too. I am aware that the Government is working on this on a daily basis. Mr Mishustin reports to me on a daily basis.
I propose discussing the measures that you have already prepared and any additional measures that you think might be appropriate in the current situation.

Meeting on measures to fight coronavirus spread in Russia
The President held a meeting on measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus in Russia.

Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region
1 of 4
At a meeting on measures to counter the spread of coronavirus in Russia.
The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, Healthcare Minister Mikhail Murashko and Head of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) Anna Popova.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: The reason for our meeting is obvious. Ms Golikova and I have discussed this matter, and now we will talk about it some more.
Moscow has been affected the most.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin: We already have some 500 coronavirus cases. Some of them have not been confirmed yet, we are working on it.
Rospotrebnadzor Head Anna Popova: We have officially confirmed 290 cases and are waiting for test results for another 150 people.
Vladimir Putin: Are all of them in Moscow?
Anna Popova: Yes.
Sergei Sobyanin: We believe that, realistically, between 80 and 90 percent of them will test positive. But the difference between 400 and 500 cases is not that big. The dynamic is high, the situation is becoming serious, especially since many people who have returned from abroad are staying at home and have not been tested. Those who have the opportunity to do so have moved to their dachas or are staying at home. They are feeling well, fortunately, so they should stay there. But many more people have fallen ill.
Aware of this dynamic, we have started taking additional measures, increasing hospital capacities and testing. We have opened nine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) labs. They tested 3,000 people yesterday and will do another 13,000 tests by the end of the week. Ms Popova is helping us with her labs as well. We are testing all the samples we receive, using also Chinese and Korean test kits. We have opened a special department at the Kommunarka hospital to check these tests to sort them out, because we are not sure of their quality even though these are certified tests. We will inspect them and choose the most effective ones. After that we will discuss the matter with Ms Popova to decide which tests should be manufactured for the purpose of health screening, possibly even informally.
We have recently introduced quarantine measures for people aged 65 or over. Thank you for supporting this initiative. We used to think that the high-risk group consisted of people arriving from abroad. Now a million people have arrived in Russia over the past 10 days, and we have to place them under quarantine so that they stay at home. This is one story. At the same time, elderly people over the age of 65 are in what we now believe to be the actual high-risk group.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, you and I had a conversation on this subject.
Sergei Sobyanin: We imposed a quarantine, which comes into effect on Thursday, and all these people will have to stay at home, even those who work. They will be placed on sick leave.
I believe that we could recommend regions experiencing similar trends to adopt measures of this kind. Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov and I introduced identical measures. The same should be done in St Petersburg and in all the million-plus cities, so that they all act along the same lines. These people are now our greatest challenge. They will require intensive care units, and this group will suffer the most severe cases. We need to flatten the curve as much as possible so that they arrive in our hospitals gradually rather than all at once. Otherwise, the system will be overwhelmed. This is what our efforts are all about.
We have drafted instructions for the regions and calculated the number of hospital beds needed by each of them, and in what wards, and worked out standards for hospital beds and hospitals in general, how many intensive care units will be required, how many ventilators and oxygen beds, and of what kind. This is a straightforward and clear standard. The instructions will be signed today and forwarded to the regions. I would like to ask you to instruct Anton Vaino to get in touch with plenipotentiary envoys to the federal districts so that we all work together on this issue and introduce strict control, since there is a lack of awareness in some regions. For example, a governor may think that if there is only person who falls sick…
In fact, testing levels are too low, and no one actually knows…
Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova: We have tested 163,000 people.
Sergei Sobyanin: …the real situation around the world.
This is how the plan looks, in all objectivity. This is not a question of good or bad. This is the objective reality everywhere. We have to understand that if 6,000 people arrive in Primorye Territory from virus-affected areas, this is a big problem, and sooner or later it will materialise.
For this reason, all regions without exception, whether they have infected people or not, have to be prepared. We will issue instructions to this effect shortly, and will oversee their implementation on the ground.
Vladimir Putin: We will discuss these measures at a meeting with the Government in a couple of hours.
Most of the infected people are in Kommunarka, right?
Sergei Sobyanin: Yes, the hospital in Kommunarka has the biggest experience. It has 500 beds. Some of the patients are not ill but are suspected cases or people who were in close contact with those infected, and there are also confirmed cases, including severe ones.
Overall, we have eight moderately severe cases, including two very severe ones: one in Kommunarka and one in another place, the 52nd Hospital, I believe. They are already hooked up to ventilators.
Vladimir Putin: So Kommunarka specialises on cases of this kind.
Tatyana Golikova: It was repurposed.
Vladimir Putin: So this was a matter of repurposing.
Sergei Sobyanin: Yes. Here is what we did. We repurposed the Kommunarka hospital to treat these cases. Yesterday I opened another clinic that was designed to serve as a state-of-the art turnkey-ready perinatal centre, but it was repurposed along with seven other hospital buildings. We are about to close a big hospital with 1,300 beds in order to repurpose it this way. Within three to four weeks we intend to expand our capacity to 5,000 beds dedicated to treating coronavirus patients. We would like to ask our colleagues to give us another 5,000 beds at federal institutions.
We need to take the same measures in all other regions. This requires extensive and major efforts. Ahead of the meeting, I visited the construction site of a new hospital. It took us two weeks to complete 40 percent of the project. Two weeks ago, I went there, pointed my finger at an empty plot and showed were the hospital was to be erected. Today, 5,000 people are working there, and we will probably open the hospital in three weeks. This will be a huge hospital. We visited the Morozov Hospital earlier today, but this one will be even bigger. It will be spread out horizontally: a one-storey building with staff living quarters, etc. It will be an enclosed space. Half of the beds in this hospital, 260 out of 500, will be in intensive-care units, which is something we have never seen before here.
I propose that we visit Kommunarka, where there are only 60 beds in intensive-care units, while the new hospital will have 260. This means that there will be a lot of equipment. Building barracks does not make any sense at this point in time. We need facilities for treating severe cases.
Vladimir Putin: Good. Let us go there and see how it all works in Kommunarka.
Sergei Sobyanin: Please do. And when this new hospital is ready, we can take a helicopter to visit it.
Vladimir Putin: Fine, but now we will take a look at the Kommunarka hospital.

Conversation with Head Physician of City Clinical Hospital No. 40 Denis Protsenko
<…>
Denis Protsenko: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a technology that has returned to our ICUs from the operating rooms after the swine flu outbreak. The city has sufficient ECMO capacity, and an ECMO centre has been set up at one of our hospitals.
Today, our department gathered for a roundtable discussion with our Chinese colleagues. They said that this time, unlike during the swine flu, the ECMO was not used that much at their hospital, with only 11 ECMO cases in a total of 6,000 patients.
Tatyana Golikova: Those were probably advanced cases.
Denis Protsenko: That is right. That gives us hope that we will not have to deal with that, either. It is a good, but rather aggressive life-saving technique.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Protsenko, I want to thank you for the way the work at your institution is organised. My warmest words of gratitude go to your entire team.
I saw them work. Everyone is in their combat posts. I do not really want to use military language, but everything at your institution operates like clockwork, a well-oiled machine. I saw that your people know what needs to be done and how to do it. They have all they need and effectively use the available equipment and means. Even an onlooker can see how well things are working. I could see how well seriously ill patients are being cared for with three specialists working on one patient at once. It is wonderful to see patients who are getting better and returning to normal life.
They owe it largely to you. Sometimes, I know this for myself, you just need to know how to organise work properly. You have done it. This is a good example of how to go about this kind of work.
My colleagues and I will have a meeting with the Government later today to discuss special medical measures for further localising the spread of the virus, as well as economic measures.
I wanted to ask you, as a person literally operating on the ground and dealing with this directly, to share your thoughts, observations or proposals on our work. This is not just about Moscow, since we will be discussing how these efforts can be used across the country.
Denis Protsenko: From a medical perspective, there are essentially two possible scenarios right now: the Asian one where the spread of the virus quickly subsides, and the Italian scenario with a growing infection rate. As a doctor, an anaesthesiologist and an emergency room practitioner, not just a chief medical officer at a clinic, I believe it is essential that we work out the Italian scenario. If one day we see a major surge in infections, and Moscow is already moving in this direction, we are ready to convert this hospital to accommodate a large number of patients.
At this very moment, we are ready to repurpose 190 of 606 beds to intensive care units. We are taking lung ventilators from storage and installing them, so these 600 beds can form a major intensive care clinic bringing together highly competent experts from across the city. This is what the Italian model is all about.
If we suddenly shift to the Chinese or Korean scenario and it all ends in April or May, I think this would make our doctors happier than anybody. Still, I think we need to be ready to face a worst-case scenario.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin: Mr President, I think that all our colleagues in the regions need to be ready to face serious challenges and complicated problems. Once we put these problems behind us, it will be a relief, but we need to be prepared.
Vladimir Putin: Of course. In fact, this is what we said during the first meeting with our colleagues today. Later today, we will talk this over with the Government at a larger meeting.
Mr Protsenko, thank you very much.
Denis Protsenko: Thank you for your appreciation. I think that your visit is the best way to motivate our team.
Vladimir Putin: I hope this sends a signal beyond your team. I would like to thank all healthcare professionals who are now working and helping people in the best traditions of Russian healthcare.
I wish you all the best.
Denis Protsenko: Thank you.
