The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. I am happy to welcome you in Moscow.
The Rio Group is one of the most representative and authoritative international organizations, and probably the most representative in the region.
The first arrival in Moscow of a representative Rio Group troika attests to the growing interaction between Russia and Latin America.
Our economic cooperation leaves something to be desired, but our political dialogue is developing, our cooperation in overcoming global threats, including terrorism, is progressing, we have corresponding agreements and the outlook is promising for developing our relations in other areas.
I very much hope that your arrival in Moscow will give a strong impetus to the development of our relations with the whole of Latin America.
