Vladimir Putin presents the banner of the Federal Bailiff Service to its Director – Chief Bailiff of the Russian Federation Artur Parfenchikov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades,
Let me congratulate you on this memorable event – presenting the banner of the Federal Bailiff Service.
As an independent executive body of power, your service was created slightly over a decade ago. A lot has been done over this period, done to enhance the rule of law and to protect the citizens’ rights and freedoms.
Today the Bailiff Service is an important element of the system of Russia’s state agencies. You play a significant part in supporting the judicial system and assisting in executing the resolutions of the bodies of power.
I would like to note that the work of bailiffs has made it possible to transfer over a trillion rubles into the national budget, while citizens and organisations have received twice as much. At the same time, as you all know, a lot remains to be done. You need to improve the mechanisms of your work, to make more active use of modern technology and to achieve maximum efficiency and openness.
The protection of the rights of children should be given special attention. I am referring here, of course, to ensuring the payment of alimony, but not only that: providing orphans with housing is of equal importance, as well as helping and supporting children left without parental care. This is not only your professional, but also a moral duty.
One of the most important tasks is to ensure the execution of court rulings to expel from the Russian Federation foreign citizens who have breached our laws. You have received such authority in 2012 and its efficient implementation is your contribution to the implementation of the national migration policy.
Comrades, I expect that your employees will continue resolving the tasks facing them, reliably protecting the interests of the state and society. The trust our citizens have in the rule of justice and the authority of the state depend on the results of your work.
I would like to wish you success, health and wellbeing. Congratulations!
