President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
Today, we are marking the 1160th anniversary of Russian statehood. I would like to congratulate you on this momentous historical date that is of key importance for Russia.
Veliky Novgorod, Rurikovo Settlement, Staraya (Old) Ladoga and Izborsk are the cradle of Rus, the source of our civilisation and our state, our culture and education.
It is from here, from the north, that the guards of the first Russian Rurik dynasty started their campaigns, that merchant caravans travelled – “from Varangians to Greeks,” and that Rus, Europe’s largest state at that time, was created. It united Slavic, Finno-Ugric, Turkic and other tribes. It gathered them under its strengthening wings from Ladoga and Baltic, Novgorod and Pskov to Kiev and Chernigov, Azov, the Black Sea and Crimea.
During more than a millennium, our statehood has lived through many eras, including cruel enemy invasions, disunity and the tragedies of feuds, but each of these difficult periods invariably ended with the revival of the Fatherland. The heroic generations of our people overcame difficulties and adversities, withstood the trials. They created and expanded the grandeur of our Fatherland and covered their names with glory.
We remember and cherish these truly outstanding people: Rurik and Prophetic Oleg, Princess Olga and Svyatoslav Igorevich, Prince Vladimir and Yaroslav the Wise, Vladimir Monomakh and Alexander Nevsky, Dmitry Donskoy and Sergius of Radonezh, Ivan III and Ivan the Terrible, Yermak, Minin and Pozharsky, Dezhnev and Bering, Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, Lomonosov and Pushkin, Suvorov and Ushakov, Alexander II the Liberator and Alexander III the Peacemaker, Brusilov and Denikin, Zhukov and Rokossovsky, Kurchatov, Korolev and Gagarin.
These and many other of our compatriots were larger-than-life, complex and occasionally controversial historical figures. Some of them saw Russia’s future differently and were even on the opposite sides of the barricades. You know, when drafting this text, I scribbled in and crossed out names like Nicholas II, Lenin, Stalin. Apparently, not enough time has passed since then from a historical point of view for us to give comprehensive and objective assessments that are free from the pressure of ongoing political developments.
However, all of them, including statesmen, workers, warriors, pioneers, scholars, ascetics and saints and, most importantly, all our people made Russia a great global power and determined its future.
To reiterate, it all began here, in Veliky Novgorod, and Novgorod's Cathedral of Saint Sophia, just like other ancient Russian cathedrals, will forever remain a sacred symbol of our historical unity. Modern Russia is the heir to Ancient Holy Rus, just as it is the heir to the Tsardom of Muscovy, the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, which were the great eras of our uninterrupted thousand-year history that we are proud of.
Today, as we peer into the depths of the past centuries, we realise that we must not only preserve, but also carry on with dignity the traditions of our ancestors, that each of us has an enormous responsibility for Russia, for protecting and strengthening our vast country, our beloved Motherland.
For centuries, Russia has been built as a home shared by people of numerous ethnicities and different religions. Our brotherhood packs the powerful energy of harmonious, independent and authentic development.
No one will ever be able to ban or cancel our unique civilisation and rich culture, just as it is impossible to rattle or even less so to destroy the values that make Russian society one and make us one big, united nation.
These values embrace loyalty to truth and justice, respect for the family, love for children, a solid foundation of traditional values such as mercifulness, compassion and mutual assistance, and the desire to make life good not just for yourself but for everyone, for the entire country, for all of Russia and, in the face of a common threat, to stand together as one “for one’s own friends” and for the Fatherland.
Being a patriot is the essence of the nature and character of the Russian people. Our heroes, our soldiers, officers and volunteers are displaying exactly these superior human qualities in the course of the special military operation. They are fighting courageously, shoulder to shoulder, as brothers for the sake of saving the people of Donbass, for the sake of peaceful skies over our children and grandchildren, for a homeland that will always be free and independent.
For 1,160 years now, we have firmly learned that for Russia it is mortally dangerous to relax its sovereignty or renounce its interests even for a limited time. Russia’s very existence has come under threat during these times.
They can no longer expect us to make these mistakes. We will not succumb to blackmail or intimidation, and we will never betray or lose our sovereignty. By strengthening it, we are developing our country.
Sovereignty is the guarantee of freedom for everyone. According to our traditions, nobody can feel truly free if his people, his Fatherland, Russia, the homeland is not free.
Responsible and strong power in our state is serving and will serve only the people of Russia. This support for the key issues on the domestic and foreign agenda can guarantee the successful, safe development of our country as one of the centres of a fairer multipolar world that is now taking shape.
We are on the side of open, honest partnership. This is our firm position and based on this we will build our relations with anyone who shares our ideals of equitable, mutually advantageous cooperation.
Friends,
Being part of a diverse Russian civilisation means happiness, but, let me repeat, it also means responsibility and duty. Our civilisation is distinct. It has its own path and there is not a bit of arrogance or a feeling of superiority in this. This civilisation of ours – this is what’s important to us.
And we will fight for our Fatherland, our homeland of which there is only one, for our independence and sovereignty, for our culture and traditions. We will uphold and defend this in the name of our ancestors and our descendants, for the sake of Russia, its great history and its great future.
My congratulations to you.
All the best. Thank you very much.

Meeting with heads of leading engineering schools and their industry partners
The President met with the heads of leading engineering schools and their industry partners, members of the Advanced Engineering Schools project. The meeting was held at the Novgorod Technical School.

Meeting with heads of leading engineering schools and their industry partners.
Before the meeting, Vladimir Putin toured an exhibition about the Novgorod Technical School laboratories.
Advanced Engineering Schools is a federal project of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, which includes leading Russian universities and Russian companies.
Its goal is to educate skilled personnel for the high-performance export-oriented sectors of the national economy and thereby ensure its technological independence, as well as to create new kinds of high-tech products jointly with businesses.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Advanced engineering schools sounds impressive and promising. In fact, Mr Andrei Nikitin suggested doing this in Novgorod, I think it was back in 2018, and then he continued working on that concept. This led to the first instructions for the Government and work on that idea here in Novgorod.
A year later, in 2019, the idea acquired a practical dimension. Mr Nikitin proposed developing it further. In 2021, United Russia took up the idea confidently, and it grew to a nationwide scale.
I am pleased that the idea has taken off because we need it very much now. Our colleagues have updated me on the certain areas. It is especially important now, although frankly, it was always important. Our large companies are used to buying everything they need, but when you cannot buy something, you have to create it yourself. The main thing is that we have the basis where we can do this, and it is first and foremost an intellectual base.
That is why it was so important to merge into this programme the intellectual capabilities, our early practical work, theory and applied research, our leading companies’ needs and financial capabilities as well as, most importantly, the end product market. The idea behind creating advanced engineering schools was to bring everything together in one place and achieve the success the country needs.
As I understand it, people in the audience have passed certain competitive procedures and won the competitions to create these schools. This is not just about Novgorod, it is being done all over the country, as far as I understand.
I am very glad that Mr Nikitin initiated this. We have gathered in Novgorod because Novgorod is known as the cradle of initiatives like this. Yaroslav the Wise instituted the first school for 300 children here in the 11th century. He (he received the noble nickname Wise much later, and for a good reason) was known not only for creating the first school, but also for focusing on the intellectual advancement of the nation and training specialists in various fields. Later, when he became a prince in Kiev, he continued this work there. But, as Andrei Nikitin just said, in Kiev he did everything mostly for the elite, whereas here he started with projects for the general public which was the right thing to do since the base is broader. Later, this practice was scaled up throughout the country by successive generations.
Let’s consider the above as opening remarks. I want to congratulate you on winning these competitions and wish you success. I am keen to hear you share your work plans and what kind of additional support you may need from the regional authorities, and who you work with at the federal centre, the Government, the Presidential Executive Office.
Please, Mr Nikitin, over to you.

Meeting with Novgorod Region Governor Andrei Nikitin
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Governor of the Novgorod Region Andrei Nikitin. They discussed the region’s socioeconomic issues.

Meeting with Novgorod Region Governor Andrei Nikitin.
Andrei Nikitin
briefly described the results of his work during his five years as Governor. The budget has almost doubled; production growth rates are strong; and the region was second in Russia in average salary growth rates in 2021. The share of quality roads increased from 26 percent to 48 percent. In addition to federal programmes, the region drafted several regional programmes for supporting businesses. Those who are prepared to purchase equipment and deal with import substitution are given subsidised loans at 2 or 3 percent interest. The budget remains socially oriented.
The Governor spoke separately about assistance for the sponsored territory – the Vasilyevsky District of the Zaporozhye Region. It received assistance to resolve its key problems – preparations for the autumn-winter season, restoring the operation of the housing and utility systems, and the start of training at schools and kindergartens. More than 200 million rubles worth of humanitarian aid was allocated to this district: plumbing, glazing and school equipment. By way of assistance, municipal workers were invited to teach how to work with the Russian budget, how to become involved in national projects and take part in different programmes.
Returning to regional issues, Andrei Nikitin told the President about the construction of and major repairs at the Valdai Central District Hospital for which the region’s experts are drafting plans for comprehensive improvement in cooperation with Moscow.
A sore point was also discussed – the condition of cultural heritage landmarks in the region with rich history, most of which belong to foreign owners. In the 1990s, citizens of Latvia and other states bought them, but they are not doing anything with them. The President said that it is necessary to set deadlines for putting these properties in order and then to confiscate them if this is not done. Andrei Nikitin said that the mechanism for confiscation is now being discussed with lawyers. Vladimir Putin said that if the legal framework is inadequate, it must be upgraded, and he advised the Governor to make the relevant proposals.
Regarding sports development, Mr Nikitin talked about the construction of a modern water sports facility with Gazprom’s assistance. It will accommodate water polo, everything for water gymnastics and a variable depth pool. In this case it will be possible to hold Olympic class competitions there.
Gazprom also included the region in its ‘Gazprom for Children’ programme, and modern children’s playgrounds have started to appear in all districts. The region is building physical fitness and sports facilities together with Gazprom. In addition, in the next five years, with maximum assistance from the region, Gazprom plans to expand the gas infrastructure to as many facilities and homes as were covered in the last 50 years. These plans have already been included in the regional programmes.
The Governor mentioned that further road repairs are a challenge for the region. Its territory is covered with marshlands and water and many bridges need repairs. He also mentioned the problem of improving cities and reducing death rates. Some successes have been achieved, but they are not enough. It is necessary to resolve the problem of treating cardio-vascular diseases, especially for people in remote areas.
The discussion also touched on the issues of education, the need to attract young people and professionals to the region, to promote projects and development. Vladimir Putin praised the Governor for creating a good educational cluster in the Novgorod Region.
