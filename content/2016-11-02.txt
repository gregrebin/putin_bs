Meeting on developing online trade.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
I propose discussing development of online trade today. This is one of the fastest-growing economic sectors; it has a big impact on the effectiveness and profitability of a business, and opens up new opportunities for people to obtain the necessary goods and services quickly and conveniently.
In Russia and all around the world, online trade is a fast-growing sector. Experts assessed its worth at 760 billion rubles in 2015 and they predict that this figure will increase to around 850 billion rubles this year.
However, this rapid growth of online trade has its issues as well. Laws and regulations do not always keep up with the rapid pace of change in the sector, and Russian and foreign players in this sector often end up in unequal conditions.
Our position is that there should be a level playing field for all players on this market. This applies to Russian businesses and to our foreign partners. Our foreign colleagues should rest assured that they will always benefit from conditions that are as good as those that Russian businesses enjoy. However, Russian businesses should not be in a worse position than their foreign colleagues. This is something we need to reflect on.
I think it important for Russia to have its own strong and influential online trading platforms. This would also help us to promote Russian goods and services more effectively not only at home but on markets abroad as well.
We have addressed this subject before and we discussed it in spring and in the summer. I know the Government is working actively on this issue and is drafting a package of measures to improve the online trade environment in Russia. Let us discuss these matters now.

Meeting with Mikhail Fradkov, left, and Sergei Chemezov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: (addressing Mikhail Fradkov) We agreed that you will head the Supervisory Council at Russian Railways but Mr Chemezov came to you with a request, and he also contacted me about using your services at Almaz-Antey, as this is a defence enterprise, and your experience as prime minister and head of foreign intelligence would be quite appropriate.
I am ready to consider this. I would like to once again hear your arguments and your positions.
Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov
: Mr President, I believe that Mr Fradkov’s expertise from his previous positions will be quite useful at our Almaz-Antey concern, especially since they have a number of classified design projects there. Mr Fradkov is quite familiar with that. And the information he possesses, I think, will be helpful for him.
Mikhail Fradkov
: Mr President, I think it is a tempting offer, it is interesting and suits me, that is, you came to the right person.
After working in the positions you assigned me to earlier, I feel familiar with the subject, it is to my liking. I believe the subject matter is important and worthwhile in all respects.
Vladimir Putin: So you are more interested in that.
Mikhail Fradkov: I am.
Sergei Chemezov: And it will make things easier for me, as my workload is too high.
Vladimir Putin: All right.
Then I have one more request for you. You know about it, we discussed it. I would like to ask you to head the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies.
Mikhail Fradkov: Mr President, thank you very much. It is a very interesting offer. This is like a package deal – strategic research, and military industrial matters.
Vladimir Putin: To ensure that the findings of the Institute lay the foundation for government agencies in their activities and are communicated to the media and the public.
Mikhail Fradkov: Thank you. I shall do my best.
