Meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and President of Mongolia Khaltmaagiin Battulga.
Speech at a meeting between the presidents of Russia, China and Mongolia
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi, President Battulga, friends,
I am happy to meet with you in this trilateral format to discuss a range of practical issues in our cooperation.
The principles and tasks of our trilateral cooperation are fixed in the roadmap approved in 2015 at our meeting in Ufa. The relevant agencies and ministries in our countries are implementing the programme for developing the Russia−Mongolia−China economic corridor signed in Tashkent in 2016. We identified priority projects in such areas as industrial production, investment and high-technology.
The Russia-Mongolia-China Joint Trade and Economic Forum took place last June in Ulaanbaatar. Dozens of our companies attended.
Our states are building cooperation in developing a modern transport infrastructure. As I said at the bilateral meeting before, last year, the volume of container traffic on the China−Mongolia−Russia route to Europe increased 2.7 times, and by almost four times in the first quarter of this year.
We plan to upgrade the Ulaanbaatar Russian−Mongolian railway and adjacent sections. We are developing an upgrade project for this railway through 2030. The first stage spanning 2018–2020 will receive $260 million in investment.
In 2016, we signed a trilateral intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in motor transportation. Russia ratified the agreement last year. We hope that our friends will do their part soon.
We are starting to work together to remove excessive administrative barriers to provide an uninterrupted flow of transit trade. To this end we have to ensure full implementation of the 2016 agreement on mutual recognition of the results of customs control inspections.
As Mr Chairman just said, the introduction of the electronic information exchange system envisaged by the agreement has already substantially expedited the process of customs clearance at the border.
We have good opportunities for interaction in energy. Our Mongolian partners have proposed oil and gas pipelines from Russia to China across their territory. Generally, we are supportive, this is a good idea. But of course, as always, thorough feasibility studies need to be carried out.
Close interregional links play a special role in the cooperation between our states. For several years now border cooperation forums have been held involving Russia’s Trans-Baikal Territory, the Inner Mongolia autonomous region in China and the border areas of Mongolia.
We believe it is important to step up the efforts to promote three-way cooperation in tourism. In this context I would like to mention the proposal to form a cross-border “Tea Road” that would link these regions in Russia, China and Mongolia.
The development of cross-border environmental programmes aimed at preserving the unique flora and fauna and developing protected territories is also important.
Russia has proposed options for stepping up tripartite cooperation among non-governmental, scientific, cultural and educational organisations as well as interaction among parliaments and political parties.
In conclusion I would like to note that we support the idea of holding the next tripartite meeting in June of 2019 during the SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan.
Thank you.

The meeting took place on the sidelines of the SCO summit, which will be held on June 10.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends and colleagues, I am glad to meet with you again.
I would like to begin this meeting by saying that a great deal has changed, or more precisely, improved in our relations since your visit to Russia. Our trade is growing rapidly. I believe it increased by 33.9 or nearly 34 percent last year and by over 43 percent in January-March this year.
We are implementing large projects. Russia’s LUKOIL alone has invested $7 billion in Uzbekistan. We have established a green corridor on the border based on your initiative. Mutual trade in fruit and vegetables has been growing rapidly, by 35–36 percent. In short, our ties are improving. In addition to LUKOIL and Gazprom, other Russian companies are doing well in mechanical engineering and other areas. There are nearly 1,000 of such companies, both big and small.
The overall dynamics is very good. We will also meet in the framework of the CIS, and I remember about your invitation. I will be delighted to make a working visit to Uzbekistan somewhere in the autumn, as we planned.
I am very pleased to see you.
President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev
: Thank you.
Mr President, once again my congratulations on your re-election. In Uzbekistan, we all believe that Russia has secured its future and elected a worthy leader. My sincere congratulations to you.
Of course, as you have just noted, strategic partnership and alliance is an unfailing course of Uzbekistan’s foreign policy. This is unprecedented: in the past year, 70 delegations from Russia have visited Uzbekistan. There have been 21 regional visits. As you already said, the trade is growing, by over 40 percent over the first quarter.
We have some ambitious projects in the pipeline. You particularly noted the oil and gas industry. The Kandym Gas Processing Complex is unique, it is the largest in Central Asia. We built it with LUKOIL in two years. It was the fastest construction project for such a facility.
We work with all Russian companies in all sectors with great confidence, trust and dedication. If just a year ago, we could name only oil and gas companies, today I cannot name a single industry in which we do not cooperate.
Thank you very much. A green corridor has been created for farming produce. We had talked about that for a long time, ten or fifteen years. Thanks to your strong will, the amount of Uzbekistani produce entering the Russian market without intermediaries is growing, as you have said.
I think we have many things to talk about. We are expecting you with a state visit. We agreed on October. I think today we also have much to discuss with our colleagues.
My sincere thank you for appointing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev chairman of the intergovernmental commission. I think this indicates your serious attitude to our cooperation. You yourself also pay great attention to it. This says a lot.
Based on the year’s results, we are anticipating some major projects, even in peaceful atom. We will also discuss the construction of a nuclear power plant. I have already met with Alexei Likhachev (Rosatom CEO) several times and we coordinated the details with your support. I think this will also be a strategic area of our cooperation.
I am glad to see you. Thank you very much.

Meeting with President of Iran Hassan Rouhani.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am pleased to see you.
Iran has long been involved in the work of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We are aware of your desire to join our organisation. You know Russia’s position on this issue. We will support your aspiration.
As for bilateral relations, I would like to say that our trade is growing, which is good news. There are good prospects.
We will also discuss other issues, of course, including regional stability and security. We have been working well together to settle the Syrian crisis. This is an issue for discussion because of the practical results achieved.
I am pleased to have this opportunity to work with you on the sidelines of this international event, within the SCO framework.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
I am also glad to have this opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the summit.
I must say that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is a very influential association that ensures security in this region, and Iran has been quite active in recent years in cooperating with this organisation.
I must express my gratitude for your position on admitting Iran as a full member of this organisation. As for our bilateral relations with the great Russia, our good neighbour, I must say that they are developing every day. Bilateral relations between our countries are unique and special, because they cover all levels and all issues.
As for the nuclear agreements, I must say that the Russian Federation has played a very important and constructive role in the implementation of these agreements. I also think that a more serious and more profound dialogue between our two countries is needed with regard to the United States’ illegal withdrawal from these agreements.
Our interaction in matters of security and stability in this region is growing more tangible with every day. I think you will agree with me that the Iranian-Russian cooperation in the fight against terrorism and various extremist groups has proved to be quite successful, and our cooperation plays a very strong and influential role in this region.
Several multilateral cooperation formats have already been established between Russia, Iran and other countries and we are deeply involved in this work.
Thank you.

Meeting with President of Mongolia Khaltmaagiin Battulga.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I would like to say that I am very happy to meet you. To start, I would like to note that everything is going well in our relations; trade is growing on both sides, and agricultural product deliveries are increasing.
Last year our energy company reduced the rates for Mongolian consumers by 30 percent. I do not know how energy is distributed inside the country but RAO UES of Russia lowered its rates.
Soon we will celebrate a joint event that is important for both of our countries. I am referring to the 80th anniversary of the victory at Khalkin Gol next year. We can prepare for this and celebrate it. I think this is important both for Mongolia and Russia.
As for vital issues of economic cooperation, I would like to note the substantial increase – 2.7 percent – in freight transit volume, container traffic on the Ulaanbaatar Railway.
In general, there is room for improvement, and I think we will talk about this today.
President of Mongolia Khaltmaagiin Battulga
(retranslated): Good afternoon, Mr President.
I am happy to be here, at our third meeting. Allow me to congratulate you on your victory in the Russian presidential election.
Mongolia is hosting a very important event, Mongolia-Russia Initiative 2018. I believe you know about this. This event is very important. We have organized an exhibition of the latest Russian agricultural equipment. Within the framework of these events, we also signed an agreement on the parameters of railway transit traffic. I believe that this agreement will benefit Mongolia’s development.
Another event held within the framework of Mongolia-Russia Initiative 2018 was the performance of the Igor Moiseyev Folk Dance Ensemble. The last time this ensemble visited Mongolia was back in 1976: it held two shows in our country’s capital, and both were sold out.
Within the framework of this event, I held a meeting with Irkutsk Region Governor Sergei Levchenko, who came up with a suggestion on promoting cooperation. As far as I understand, you have agreed to this.
With the Transport Minister, we have been discussing this project as well as various areas of cooperation, such as the construction of gas and oil pipelines, and roads and railways.
To implement these agreements, we need to reach complete understanding between both sides.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet you on the sidelines of this international event.
First of all, I would like to say that our strategic partnership continues to develop. I am delighted to say that Russia remains Tajikistan’s main trade and economic partner ahead of Kazakhstan and China.
In January-March 2018, our trade increased by another 18 percent. Work is proceeding quite actively. Our companies have invested nearly $2 billion in your economy.
We are also modernising your armed forces and training your military personnel. A total of 500 Tajikistani servicemen are studying at Russian Defence Ministry academies.
There are many security issues on our agenda in light of the complicated situation on your southern borders, that is, in Afghanistan. We will discuss them today.
We will also meet in Dushanbe in October.
I am pleased to see you today and to have this opportunity to carry on our work.
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Thank you, Mr President.
This is our first meeting since your re-election. I would like to congratulate you once again and to wish you strong health and success. I am pleased to have this meeting with you.
We highly appreciate the level of relations between our countries. I would like to use this occasion to discuss with you some aspects of our strategic partnership. Also, I would like to hold an in-depth discussion on regional security, including the situation on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border.
Prime Minster Dmitry Medvedev recently paid an official visit to Tajikistan. We held detailed discussions on all aspects of our trade and economic cooperation.
I am pleased to meet with you.
