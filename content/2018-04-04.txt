Beginning of meeting with President of Iran Hassan Rouhani
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I would like to wholeheartedly welcome you, this time within the framework of a trilateral meeting.
We maintain regular dialogue at practically all levels and in all spheres of our interaction.
We maintain regular political contacts, including personally with you. I also met with Iran’s spiritual leader during my visit to your country. Our foreign ministers work in close contact, as do our defence officials as well.
We are working together on the most painful current subjects, including that of the Syrian problem.
I am very glad that we have met once again, because such meetings offer us an opportunity to talk about bilateral ties and what we can do to develop them, as well as about international affairs, primarily in the region.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani
(retranslated): Mr President,
I am very glad to have this opportunity to meet with you again.
It is our 12th meeting over the past four years and several months. This shows that our countries hold similar views on bilateral matters as well as international topics.
Speaking about regional affairs, we maintain close cooperation, in particular regarding the Syrian settlement. I would like to say that the summit that was held in Sochi at your initiative has launched our movement towards the settlement of the Syrian crisis. After that summit meeting, you hosted the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi, which has produced good results.
I am very glad that the second round of our three countries’ summit is being held in Ankara. We have three ambitious goals: security and stability, the repatriation of refugees, and the choice of Syria’s future by Syrians themselves.
I hope that our meeting today will facilitate the restoration of peace and security in our region.
