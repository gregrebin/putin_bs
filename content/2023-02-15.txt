President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Mishustin, colleagues, good afternoon.
Our agenda today includes a very important issue that is far from just a technical one, on the main areas of tax administration in 2023. Mr Yegorov will report on this.
But first of all, I would like to ask Mr Kotyakov to update us on the issue of social payments, which we increased by 11.9 percent on February 1, based on actual inflation. The increase in payments affected a total of 16 million people.
Mr Kotyakov, there is money, the source has been identified, the Government has resolved all issues. How is the technical work proceeding?
(Anton Kotyakov reported to the President on the progress of work on transferring social payments to different categories of people and their adjustment for inflation, as well as on the rules of allocating allowances and processing them. Replying to the President’s question, the minister described how social support measures were being carried out in the four new regions – the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions.
At the President’s request, Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov reported on the production of optical fibre in Russia. He recalled that the country mastered its manufacture in 2016. Before that, all optical fibre was imported from Europe and Japan. Today, the only producer of fibre for telecom in the entire EAEU is Optic Fibre Systems, a company in Saransk (Mordovia). Its production capacity was increased to 4 million kilometres of fibre per year, which meets almost half of the domestic demand. To fully cover the market, the company drafted a comprehensive investment project. It will expand the company's capacity to 10 million kilometres of fiber per year, allowing it to meet the requirements of not only Russia but also other EAEU member-states. There are already agreements with the Republic of Belarus. Denis Manturov stressed that the project is crucial for the telecom sector, considering the Digital Economy national programme and the need to expand the coverage of high-speed data transmission. Chairman of the VEB.RF State Development Corporation Igor Shuvalov and Head of the Republic of Mordovia Artem Zdunov commented on the minister’s report.
Minister of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media Maksut Shadayev explained how they are transferring
mass-scale social services to electronic format. To this end, a big platform was built, in part for the regional and municipal authorities. They are at different digitisation levels and many of them were not even technically equipped to receive electronic requests from the website. There is a very big system, embracing about 60,000 officials and 7,000 government bodies, which will be used as a first step to creating the large platform Gostech. The officials in the current system review incoming requests and make decisions on rendering relevant services. This is a big inter-departmental project. Mr Shadayev also spoke about the introduction of digital document copies.
Head of the Federal Tax Service Daniil Yegorov reported on the main theme of the meeting – major areas of tax administration in 2023.)

Meeting with leader of New People party Alexei Nechayev
The President met with Alexei Nechayev, the head of the New People party faction in the State Duma.

Alexei Nechayev, the head of the New People party faction in the State Duma.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nechayev, deputies from your party and its faction in Parliament head two State Duma committees – on small and medium businesses and on tourism. But the interests of the party and its faction in the Duma are, of course, much broader – you deal with many issues.
Let us talk about your priorities.
Leader of the New People party Alexei Nechayev
: Mr President,
We, the New People party, understand that there is no other choice than to build a strong country, a state that enjoys respect in the world, and we are already achieving this.
It is very important to have economic and technological self-sufficiency. Only this will allow our children and grandchildren to live in a rich, prosperous and peaceful country. But we will not achieve peace if we do not have superiority over our opponent. I do not have to tell you that our opponent is a top professional with a bad conscience – he can do one thing face-to-face, while tacitly feeding subversives that are aiming at historical Russia. Therefore, superiority is a must.
Our party supports your adopted course of building a strong and independent Russia. We are working for this in cooperation with the Government and our colleagues in the State Duma. Over the past year, the government reviewed over 70 of our initiatives and over 30 of them were carried out. This is certainly a very good result.
As for the State Duma, there is an atmosphere of unity there. It is very important to realise that unity does not mean uniformity where everyone is the same. Unity lies in diversity when different positions are expressed and honest debate begins. The debates may be heated but the goal is, of course the same – the benefit of Russia.
There were heated debates: should we put the economy on a military track? Should we introduce state regulation of prices? We are reassuring our colleagues by pointing to the fact that the military industry has already been put on a military track.
As for market principles, Russia is so strong largely because it has a market economy. I can see that people hear this. It would be rational for the country to have an industrial policy, a new industrialisation and even protectionism, although we are still not accustomed to talking about it. We have always been open and friendly, but we are all sick of playing a game where the deck is stacked against us.
Thank you for supporting the same common-sense positions because people are certainly listening closely to you. Thank you for seeing it this way.
Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you for your position, It is very important today.
Alexei Nechayev: A year ago, I told you about a big project called I’m in Business. It is aimed at developing youth entrepreneurship. You listened to this with great interest and supported this project.
We did a lot in the past year. We opened branches in 62 regions and involved over 85,000 students and schoolchildren in this educational programme. Firstly, it is obvious that there is a big demand for this – people want to do things themselves, achieve their goals and, frankly, make money. I am all for that – it is great when people are in business. Practical patriotism comes in all different varieties, and this is one of them.
This year, we are planning to launch this programme in the new regions as well. I know from our activists that people in Lisichansk and Severodonetsk mostly earn money through what is called small business. Moreover, they not only make money but ensure that all the necessary supplies are available. Strange as it may seem but there is a big business boom in Donetsk and Lugansk. Not only our activists are telling me about this. Denis Pushilin also confirmed this during our meeting.
So, if you support this, we will be moving there as well.
Vladimir Putin: Of course.
Alexei Nechayev: In general, young people in the country see that there are opportunities to reach their potential. If we want, I am sure we can make them honestly feel that they can make it here. And maybe let the people who left the country develop a healthy sense of envy for those who stayed, because of course Russia needs us more than any other place.
Vladimir Putin: Exactly so. I know you have some proposals.
