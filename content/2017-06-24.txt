During his visit to Artek Mr Putin took part in the opening ceremony for the seventh shift of 2017 dedicated to Samantha Smith, an American schoolgirl who visited the USSR as a Goodwill Ambassador and became a symbol of international children’s diplomacy.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Hello, everyone,
Welcome to the new seventh shift at Artek.
You already know that Artek was set up back in 1925. It was created as an international camp not only for children from all the republics of the former Soviet Union but also from other countries. A short while ago Artek went through a hard period but now it is being revived, revived as an international camp.
The very best of young people used to come here, both from our country and from abroad. I know that here you will learn the most important thing in life – how to foster friendships. And I encourage you to follow that path. Whatever place your peers have come from, you should always remember that they are your friends.
Artek has much to offer. It teaches you to live, it teaches you to acquire new knowledge. And I very much hope that this knowledge, these skills, the high honour of being an Artek kid, and the friendships you will start here will accompany you throughout your lives.
Welcome!
