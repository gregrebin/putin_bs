President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon, colleagues,
The start of work in this new year of 2012 coincides with a ceremonial event – the presentation of a banner of the Russian Federation Investigative Committee. The banner symbolises honour and loyalty to one’s duty. These qualities have always served as the main yardstick of professionalism among those working for the investigation agencies.
The law on the Investigative Committee came into force just over a year ago, on January 15, 2011. It established an independent investigative body for the first time in our country’s history. I said at that moment that I expected to see professional and effective work from the Investigative Committee and, of course, an increase in the percentage of crimes solved. The year gone by has produced overall decent results, and probably most important of all is that the quality of investigations is increasing.
”Honour and loyalty have always served as the main yardstick of professionalism among those working for the investigation agencies. I expected to see professional and effective work from the Investigative Committee.“
There is no doubt that the Investigative Committee still has much organisational work to do in order to make full use of its possibilities. The investigative agencies’ work needs overall improvement, and this concerns not just expanding the use of modern methods and advanced technology. As the heads of investigations departments, you all know that it is just as important for investigators to have the right personal qualities: to have principles, but at the same time be well-intentioned and psychologically stable, given the high level of stress that investigators inevitably have to cope with in their jobs.
Of course you need to continue developing your professional skills and knowledge. Our people and country expect you to be highly professional in your work. I am sure that everyone working for the Investigative Committee will continue to ensure reliable protection of our country’s interests and our citizens’ lawful rights and interests.
In conclusion, I want to congratulate all of the Investigative Committee’s staff on today’s big event, and I sincerely wish you success in the work you perform in our country’s service.
