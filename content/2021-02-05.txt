President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today we will talk about the efficiency of state policy in the sphere of international humanitarian cooperation and interaction with compatriots abroad.
It is a big part of our job, and we understand how important it is, not only for those who live abroad, beyond Russia, yet feel a connection with their historical homeland, but also for all of us here for a large number of reasons. Today we will discuss all aspects of this issue.
