Beginning of talks with President of South Korea Moon Jae-in
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, welcome to Vladivostok.
I would like to thank you for accepting our invitation and attending the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia.
We had a telephone conversation yesterday. I welcome this opportunity to meet with you in person and to discuss issues of concern to us, in particular the recent situation with the North Korean nuclear and missile programme. I am also glad to be able to discuss bilateral relations, primarily economic ties, with you.
I would like to begin by saying that a minor decline of 16.6 percent last year has given way to a nearly 50 percent increase in bilateral trade in the first half of this year. But we can do better, of course.
I hope to be able to discuss all these issues today. Welcome.
President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in
 (retranslated): Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking you for the invitation to attend the third Eastern Economic Forum, to which you, Mr President, attach much significance.
We have talked a great deal with you recently, exchanging opinions by telephone and meeting several times in a short period of time. I think that this has made us very close.
Mr President, we are of a similar age and have many things in common. There are many similarities in life. And this makes me feel that we are very close.
I would like to point out that here are many common elements and points of contact between your policy for the development of the [Russian] Far East and my policy, the New Northern Policy. I would say that you and I share a dream. I believe that South Korea is the best partner for Russia in the development of the Far East. If we promote our cooperation, we will bring prosperity not only to the Far East but to the region as a whole.
I want to use my term as president to move Korean-Russian ties to a fundamentally new level, and I pin great hopes in this respect to our meeting today. I hope we will have fruitful talks.
I would like to remind you that the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia has been seriously complicated by the ongoing North Korean provocations. Unless North Korea stops its provocations, the situation can become unpredictable.
In this context, I would like to exchange opinions with you on ways to end North Korean provocations and to find solutions to the related problems.
Once again, thank you for creating this opportunity to exchange opinions.

Meeting with Vice Premier of the Chinese State Council Wang Yang.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade Wang Yang, friends and colleagues,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Vladivostok. You know that I have held extensive talks with the President of China, Comrade Xi Jinping, who is a big friend of Russia. I would like to again congratulate our Chinese friends on the success of this BRICS summit.
I would like to say that you personally are doing a great deal to promote Russian-Chinese ties. In this context, I will sign an executive order to award you the Order of Friendship. You will receive the order during your meeting with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
I know that you have a packed agenda. You have been to one city today, and tomorrow you will travel to another city, Khabarovsk. You have come here from a trip to Volgograd, and in Khabarovsk you will chair a meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission on the development of relations between the Russian Far East and Northeast China.
I would like to say that nearly 200 Chinese companies were presented at the Eastern Economic Forum last year. Contracts worth nearly 2 trillion rubles, or more precisely 1.9 trillion rubles, were signed then. Total Chinese investments made in the Russian Far East in the past two years exceed $3 billion. This is evidence of our efforts to implement the agreements we reached with the President of China.
I am confident that we will be able to do a great deal at this year’s forum as well. We know that many of our Chinese friends, business people, have come to the forum. We hope that the volume of contracts we sign this year will be even larger than last year.
Your work has produced a solid practical result.
Vice Premier of the People’s Republic of China State Council Wang Yang (retranslated): Mr President,
First of all, I would like to thank you for your high opinion of the BRICS summit in Xiamen.
I also want to thank you for awarding me the Order of Friendship. It is a great honour for me, and I am ready to make even greater, maximum efforts to promote Chinese-Russian relations.
I also want to say that this is the second time you are receiving the Chinese delegation and me personally in the beautiful city of Vladivostok. I think that this is not just a protocol issue; it speaks to your great attention, the strengthening of the traditional friendship between our countries, as well as the efforts to intensify bilateral contacts.
Vladimir Putin: I remember that you attended the first forum in 2015. We met there.
Wang Yang: Yes. This is my third visit to Vladivostok.
Over the past three years, the implementation of the Far East development strategy has changed Vladivostok. I think that the changes in Vladivostok are a microcosm of all the changes in Russia. I want to note that in recent years, under your leadership, Russia has dealt with the sluggish growth of the world economy, and, despite the sanctions of the West, has maintained stability and solidarity in society. The Russian economy began to gradually, steadily recover. Key economic indicators improved. As a good neighbour, a reliable partner and a good friend, the Chinese side is sincerely glad for your success.
The Ambassador told me that during the BRICS summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping offered a new assessment of bilateral relations. He said that Chinese-Russian relations are not just relations, but comprehensive strategic partnership and cooperation, as well as friendship. For me, too, this is very positive, good news.
I think that as your friend, I can resolve other issues for you, leaving more time for you to relax. (Laughter.)
You know well the programme of my stay in Russia. Indeed, I held a meeting with Mr Rogozin yesterday, and tomorrow I am ready to take part in the work of the China-Russia business dialogue together with Mr Trutnev. The day after tomorrow, all of us will go to Khabarovsk to hold the first meeting of the intergovernmental commission. Such a high intensity and frequency of contacts is indicative of more active interaction between our countries. The main objective of my visit to Russia is to implement the agreements reached at the level of the heads of state.
I would like to tell you that Mr Rogozin, Mr Trutnev and I have established not only close working contacts; we are old, good friends.
Now let me say a few more words about the progress we made after our meeting in 2015. At that time, an initiative to strengthen cooperation in maritime affairs was put forward. I would like to let you know that last year, the Chinese Maritime Safety Administration and the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences undertook two joint expeditions to the Bering Sea, that is, in the Arctic area.
On September 20 of this year, the aforementioned organisations will hold a joint seminar on maritime research in Vladivostok. During the upcoming seminar, the First Institute of the Chinese Maritime Safety Administration will sign an agreement with the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences on establishing the Centre for the Study of Maritime and Climatic Conditions. These are the results of work in the area of maritime research.
I can assure you that it was not for nothing that you awarded me the Order of Friendship. (Laughter.) I did my bit to promote cooperation.
Thank you very much for the time accorded to me.
Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping’s assessments of the level and nature of our relations are absolutely objective and correspond to realities. But it is you and your Russian and Chinese colleagues who are creating the real substance behind all this in the course of your work. I would like to thank you for this again and wish you success.

Signing Russian-South Korean documents.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
We have just completed our meeting with President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in. We had a meaningful and constructive conversation, and discussed in detail the state and future of bilateral relations, as well as urgent regional and international issues.
The Republic of Korea is one of Russia’s key partners in the Asia-Pacific Region. We have always maintained close and mutually beneficial economic ties between our countries. It is telling that in the first six months of 2017 bilateral trade increased by almost 50 percent, reaching $10 billion.
More than 600 South Korean companies operate in Russia, and investment from South Korea in the Russian economy exceeds $2 billion.
The most successful projects include the Hyundai Motor car plant in St Petersburg with an annual capacity of up to 200,000 cars, the construction of a confectionery plant by Lotte Group in the Kaluga Region, and a business centre and hotel in Moscow, and also large-scale home appliance manufacturing by Samsung and LG in Russia.
Korean businesses are highly interested in stepping up cooperation with Russia, something that was confirmed at the Eastern Economic Forum by the presence of a high-profile delegation of almost a hundred business leaders representing 50 companies.
We hope that Korean businesses will be equally interested in taking part in INNOPROM 2018 International Industrial Trade Fair in Yekaterinburg, where South Korea will be a partner country.
Today Mr President and I have agreed to stimulate the operation of the joint investment and finance platforms with the aggregate capital of $1 billion and to create a portfolio of promising projects, primarily for the Far East, where we can make use of the opportunities offered by the priority development areas and the Free Port of Vladivostok.
During our talks, the Korean partners confirmed their interest in creating a free trade zone with the Eurasian Economic Union. It has been decided to continue expert consultations on this issue.
We also expressed satisfaction with the successful development of our energy cooperation. South Korean companies are involved in the Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 projects. We are discussing the possibility of increasing the delivery of liquefied natural gas. Fifteen tankers will be built at South Korean shipyards to transport the products of the Yamal LNG plant.
I would like to say that Russia is still willing to implement trilateral projects with the participation of North Korea. We could deliver Russian pipeline gas to Korea and integrate the power lines and railway systems of Russia, the Republic of Korea and North Korea. The implementation of these initiatives will be not only economically beneficial, but will also help build up trust and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
We see the advantages of the potential involvement of South Korean companies in the construction of infrastructure facilities in Russia, including the modernisation of Far Eastern ports and shipyards and the joint development of the Northern Sea Route.
We also consider it important to develop cooperation in agriculture. We will continue working to lift obstacles that hinder trade in this area. We have scored the first positive results: Russian food deliveries to South Korea grew 17 percent to $870 million in the first seven months of this year.
Mr Moon Jae-in and I agreed on the importance of stepping up regional ties. The first meeting of the Russian-Korean Forum for Interregional Cooperation is expected to take place in the beginning of 2018.
Cultural ties are also gaining momentum. In May and June, Russia hosted the Festival of Korean Culture, which was a great success, and Korea will host the Festival of Russian Culture next year.
The 8th Youth Dialogue was held as part of the Russia – Republic of Korea Dialogue forum in Seoul and Pyeongchang. We hope that South Korean youth will proactively contribute to the 19th World Festival of Youth and Students that will take place in Sochi in October 2017.
As everyone knows, next year the Republic of Korea will host the 23rd Winter Olympic Games. I would like to thank Mr Moon Jae-in for his invitation to attend the opening ceremony.
South Korea has become a popular destination for Russian tourists. Last year, the number of Russian tourists travelling to South Korea increased by 19 percent, while the flow of Korean tourists to Russia increased by 20 percent. There is no doubt that this was largely attributable to the visa free arrangement between the two countries.
Of course, during the talks we paid special attention to the situation on the Korean Peninsula, in the follow-up to the September 4 telephone conversation on the sharp deterioration of the situation after yet another nuclear test carried out by the DPRK.
I confirmed Russia’s principled position to Mr Moon Jae-in. Russia does not recognise North Korea’s nuclear status. Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programme is a flagrant violation of the UN Security Council resolution, it undermines the non-proliferation regime and poses a threat to security in Northeast Asia.
This is the reason why Russia supported the statement made by the President of the UN Security Council on August 29 to condemn the latest ballistic missile launches. At the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on September 4, we also condemned North Korea’s nuclear test explosion.
At the same time, it is obvious that the Korean problems cannot be settled with sanctions and pressure alone. We must not yield to emotions or try to drive North Korea into a corner. Now is the time for all of us to summon the presence of mind and to avoid taking steps that could escalate tensions.
It will be difficult to resolve the situation without political and diplomatic methods. More precisely, it will be impossible to resolve it without this. We put forth our practical proposals on this matter in the Russian-Chinese roadmap. We urge all parties concerned to seriously consider our initiative, which offers a practical way, as we see it, to ease tensions and to move gradually towards a settlement on the peninsula.
In conclusion, I would like to say that our talks with Mr President were open and productive. We have agreed to maintain regular contacts.
I have formed an impression that our Korean colleagues are interested in promoting bilateral relations. I would like to assure them that we are interested in this as well.
Thank you.
President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in (retranslated): Allow me to begin by expressing gratitude to President Putin for inviting me to attend the Eastern Economic Forum as a guest of honour.
I visited Russia four months after assuming the office of President of Korea. I made this visit before any other visits I made in the capacity of President of Korea. This shows the significance I attach to partnership with Russia.
The Far East is an area where Russia’s eastern policy and Korea’s New Northern Policy converge. Vladivostok is the gate to the East. It has deep historical and cultural ties with Korea.
I am very impressed by the dynamic development of Vladivostok. The Republic of Korea is the best partner in the development of the Far East. I am confident that an active involvement of the Korean Government and business community in the development of the Far East will help turn it into a solid platform for promoting peace and prosperity in the region.
Today Mr President and I reaffirmed our strong will and our vision for the further development of bilateral relations. We also discussed a wide range of issues related to the strengthening of our practical cooperation, primarily the expansion of the foundation for bilateral relations, including in the Far East.
The Korean Government has recently created the Northern Economic Cooperation Committee under the President. This has completed the creation of a management system that will make Korea the leader in the development of the Far East. The Committee is tasked with strengthening economic cooperation with Northeast Asian and Eurasian countries. In the future, cooperation between the Committee and Russia’s Far Eastern Federal District and the Ministry for the Development of the Russian Far East will play a key role in the development of the Far East.
Next year, we will create a Korean-Russian Regional Cooperation Forum. It should bolster contacts between regional governments in Korea and the Russian Far East. Cooperation channels between regional economic communities and small and medium-sized businesses will greatly expand contacts between people and promote practical cooperation.
Mr President and I also agreed to expand financial support and consulting services to promote investment cooperation in Russia’s Far East in various areas. Specifically, we agreed to create a new investment facility for a total of $2 billion for supporting projects in the Far East.
A decision was taken to establish a centre for Korean investors in order to support Korean businesses that want to work in Russia’s Far East, and address issues that Korean businesses face. We also agreed to hold regular Korean Investor Days in both countries.
Since the free trade agreement between Korea and the EAEU has the potential of bolstering cooperation not only between Korea and Russia, but also between Korea and other EAEU members, we agreed to set up a working group to explore the possibility of signing an agreement of this kind. I think that the nexus between the rich natural and energy resources in Russia’s Far East, on the one hand, and Korean technology, on the other, could transform Russia’s Far East into a new territory of growth and prosperity for both countries.
Many Korean companies already operate in priority development areas and the Free Port of Vladivostok. The project to build a fish processing complex and other projects promise great added value. I hope that as more projects of this kind are launched, we can develop a business-to-business cooperation model and create a new bilateral cooperation framework.
The world's first icebreaking liquefied natural gas tanker was built by a Korean shipbuilding company and transferred to Russia, opening the era of the Northern Sea Route, which until then seemed to lie in the distant future. This example shows that this kind of effective bilateral cooperation can be replicated in a number of traditional areas, including transport infrastructure, seaport development, agriculture, etc.
Despite the second warning from the international community, North Korea held the sixth nuclear test last week, which has been firmly censured. The North Korean nuclear and missile ambitions are the biggest threat to the development of the huge potential of the Korean Peninsula and the Russian Far East. This is why we have come to the conclusion that this problem must be settled as soon as possible.
Mr President and I have agreed that nuclear missile tests are the wrong choice and that our current task is to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In this context, I highly appreciate the commitment of Mr President and the Russian Government to the principle of nuclear non-proliferation and their efforts to implement the UN Security Council resolution and to settle the North Korean problem through diplomatic means.
At the same time, Mr President has expressed his understanding of and support for the Korean Government’s efforts towards a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and improved relations between the two Korean states. I appreciate this. Such communication between heads of state is conducive to strengthening strategic ties aimed at settling the North Korean problem.
Mr President and I have also agreed to build up the basis for the implementation of trilateral projects with participation of the two Korean states and Russia, which will connect the Korean Peninsula and the Russian Far East. Despite lengthy talks, these projects have not progressed for a number of reasons, including the North Korean problem. We have decided to give priority to the projects that can be implemented in the near future, primarily in the Far East. The development of the Far East will promote the prosperity of our two countries and will also help change North Korea and create the basis for the implementation of the trilateral agreements. We will be working hard on this.
In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr President on the success of the third Eastern Economic Forum. Mr President and I will open a new page of cooperation not only between the Korean Peninsula and the Russian Far East, but also between Northeast Asia and Eurasia in general.
I would like to again express my gratitude to the Russian Government and people for this warm welcome.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I want to congratulate our Korean friends on the Korean national team winning the right to participate in the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. We look forward to welcoming your team.

At the meeting with representatives of foreign business community.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues, I am happy to greet you here.
First of all, I want to thank you all for meeting here in Vladivostok, Russia, for showing interest in working in the Russian market in general and in the Russian Far East in particular.
Today here, there are representatives of many countries from the Asian region and our colleagues from European countries. Some of you have already started working in Russia and the Russian Far East, while others are in the final stages of the decision-making process.
I know that you have projects in a wide variety of fields, including transport infrastructure, mining, the processing industry, healthcare and a number of other industries that are interesting in terms of business for participation in these projects in the Far East of the Russian Federation.
Such meetings are always of great value for me and for my colleagues from the Executive Office and the Russian Government. They make it possible not only to build trust, which is extremely important, bearing in mind that business to a great deal relies on trust between all participants in this process. But it is also important to hear your opinions, your assessments of business conditions in Russia, in the Russian Far East. I mean if there are any problems that require special attention from the authorities of regions or cities or the Russian Government in general, what needs to be done to improve the business climate in the country, what administrative procedures are still hindering and are to be streamlined.
So, feedback from those who work and want to work in Russia is important to us.
I once again cordially welcome you all, and at the beginning of our meeting I would like to toast your health and success.
