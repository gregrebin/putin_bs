Premier of the State Council of the People’S Republic of China Wen Jiabao (retranslated): Mr President,
It is a great pleasure to meet with you. I want to congratulate you on your inauguration as President of the Russian Federation.
The international situation remains very complex today, and in this context strengthening the strategic cooperation between our countries is not just in China’s and Russia’s basic interests, but has great importance for ensuring peace and stability throughout the world.
Mr President, I know that you and President Hu Jintao held friendly and fruitful talks yesterday, and this in itself symbolises just how successful your current visit to China is.
I want to take the opportunity today’s meeting offers to exchange views on all issues of interest to both sides.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Premier.
It is a great pleasure to meet with you again. We did indeed achieve a lot yesterday with President Hu Jintao and signed a large number of agreements. 
I know how this work takes place. You and I have worked together for four years, and I know that it is the governments in both countries that are primarily responsible for organising these kinds of meetings.
I am very pleased to have this chance to continue our work together and continue our business and personal contacts too. The Russian and Chinese prime ministers will have their next meeting in autumn, and I am sure that this will mark yet another step in developing our multilateral strategic partnership.

Vice President of the People’S Republic of China Xi Jinping (translated from Russian): Mr President,
It is a great pleasure to see you again. I welcome you for this state visit and for the SCO’s Beijing summit.
Let me start by congratulating you once again on your election as President of the Russian Federation. I am sure that under you wise leadership the Russian people will attain further great success in building and developing their country. 
Our intensive high-level contacts are one of the most vivid signs of the friendly relations between our countries. I made an official visit to Russia two years ago at your invitation. Russia’s rapid development, huge potential, and the positive trends in our bilateral relations’ development made a deep impression on me. I still remember my meeting with you very clearly.
This year, I have had the opportunity to meet in Beijing with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Deputy Prime Ministers Vladislav Surkov and Dmitry Rogozin, and with the Defence Minister and Secretary of the Security Council.
Not even a month has passed, and you have now come to us on this state visit. This shows how much attention you and Russia in general give to the relations between our countries. We are sure that we have broadest of horizons before us for developing these relations further.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Vice President,
I also recall clearly our meeting in Moscow and am happy to have the chance to continue our business and personal contacts today.
This visit is indeed going very well. We had a very substantial two-part discussion yesterday with President Hu Jintao and signed some very important political and economic agreements. We confirmed our relations’ strategic nature. I am confident that we have excellent economic prospects ahead.
With global and European finances in such a turbulent state right now, our economic cooperation is a key factor in international economic stability.
Russian-Chinese relations are important not just economically, however, but are also a big stabilising factor in international affairs and global security, and ultimately contribute to our countries’ steady development. This is in the interests of both peoples. 
I hope very much that today’s visit and the high-level contacts we have planned in China and in Russia, including through our defence agencies, will give impetus to our all-round strategic partnership’s continued development.
We will continue our cooperation. We held successful military exercises just recently in the Yellow Sea. These were the first joint Russian-Chinese naval exercises. Yesterday, we agreed with President Hu Jintao to continue our cooperation in this area.

Vice Premier of the State Council of the People’S Republic of China Li Keqiang (translated from Russian): Mr President,
It is a great pleasure to meet with little more than a month since we last met. I wish you welcome to China on this state visit and in order to take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Beijing summit.
We met recently during my official visit to Russia, during which you and other Russian senior officials showed me great hospitality. I thank you very much for this.
I know that you are in the midst of a series of brief visits abroad, but you are spending more time in China, and I think this demonstrates the importance you attach to developing Chinese-Russian relations. 
By the way, I read with attention your article in Renmin Ribao yesterday, in which you give a deep strategic analysis of the different areas of our cooperation, and I agree with much of what you said.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: It is a great pleasure to be here in friendly China. We do indeed have a very full programme of work together with our Chinese partners, including with the government. This is only natural, given the strategic nature of our relations, which are distinguished by genuine friendship and partnership, and the big amount of cooperation between us.
As President Hu Jintao and I noted yesterday, we have trade turnover of $83.5 billion, which is a decent figure. I am sure we can soon increase it to $100 billion or $200 billion. We have big plans in many areas of cooperation, and I know better than anyone just what a big part both countries’ governments play in this work.
I am sure that the 17th meeting of our two countries’ prime ministers in Moscow this autumn will give a big boost to further developing our bilateral ties. It is a great pleasure to continue the personal contacts I have with you and your colleagues.
