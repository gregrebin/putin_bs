Prime Minister of Japan Yasuo Fukuda: Mr President!
First of all I would like to thank you for the warm welcome that you extended me during my visit to Russia in April and for finding time to meet with me then.
I am delighted to welcome you to Japan. I am grateful for your active contribution to the discussions during the G8.
Our previous meeting took place before you assumed the office of president, and I have drawn attention to the fact that, after assuming the office of president, you have announced new initiatives, attaching special importance to protecting individual liberty and the rule of law.
I have carefully read the interview that you gave to the media prior to your coming to Japan.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Dear Mr Prime Minister!
First of all I would like to thank you for the excellent organisation of the summit, and for providing us with such a comfortable environment and such a beautiful place to work in. And, despite the fog, work is proceeding at a very good pace.
