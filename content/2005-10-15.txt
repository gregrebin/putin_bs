Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister, first of all I would like to thank you for having found the time for a trip to Moscow.
I must say that recently our trade and economic relations have actively developed. I am even afraid to name the growth's exact percentage â€“ it really is outstanding. In absolute terms this growth is modest enough but still decent; this year we can attain 1.7 billion USD. We consider Thailand our prospective partner in Asia.
Mr Prime Minister, I wish to congratulate you and your government on the economic results you have recently achieved. The low rate of inflation combined with the economy's high growth rate is a very good sign.
Thaksin Shinawatra (translated from Russian): First of all, Mr President allow me to thank you for the warm reception you gave me and the members of my delegation and for being able to meet with me on a Saturday, especially since this visit was organized only a short time ago. I wish to express my condolences regarding the events in the south of Russia. In my country there are the same problems in the south. I very much hope that you can resolve the situation and that I will manage to do the same in the south of Thailand.
As you may remember, during my first visit to Russia two and a half years ago the volume of trade amounted to one billion USD. And I hope that by the end of this year the volume will reach two billion USD. I have been closely following Russia's level of growth and development and would like to express my admiration to the President of Russia for such high indicators of growth during the last few years.
During the present visit I intend to strengthen close relations with Russia on all levels. Especially in the areas of security, the economy and politics. I am also glad to welcome Russia as a member of the ACD.
I will be very glad to welcome your Excellency during the ASEAN summit that will take place in December of this year.
