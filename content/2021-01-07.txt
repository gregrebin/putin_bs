Vladimir Putin answers a journalist’s question following Christmas mass.
Question: Today is Christmas, a holiday, and we want to hope for the best. Do you ever ponder why such events – uneasy, hard ones – actually happen? Maybe from a religious or a philosophical perspective.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: You know, this question with a religious perspective would be better addressed to a clergyman or a priest. They would offer a fuller and broader answer.
I can only say as a secular person. God’s love for Man lies not in granting all our requests and wishes but rather in allowing us to pray for him and ourselves in the hope for the best. This hope and, occasionally, anticipation of a miracle is the very star that lights up our life’s journey and supports us in its hardest stages.
Happy Christmas to you!
