President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Annan, I wish you a warm welcome to Russia. You have come here as part of the special instructions and mission you are currently pursuing. I want to say how much we value the efforts you are making. This is perhaps Syria’s last chance to avoid a bloody and protracted civil war. We will therefore give you any possible assistance at every level and in all areas in which Russia can provide support. We hope very much that your work will yield a positive result. 
Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States For Syria KOFI ANNAN
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
I’m extremely happy to be here and to be able to discuss the issue of Syria with you. I’ve already had a very good discussion with the Foreign Minister [Sergei] Lavrov
. We’ve met in Cairo and today we’ve followed our discussion. And I want to thank you and the Russian Federation for the support you’ve given me so far. And now, as we move forward, I will continue to rely on your support and advice.
And I think you are right when you say that Syria has an opportunity today to work with me and this mediation process to put an end to the conflict, to the fighting and really to allow access to those in need of humanitarian assistance as well as embark on a political process that will lead to a peaceful settlement.
Thank you.
Dmitry Medvedev: Thank you.
