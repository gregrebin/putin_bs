President of Vietnam Tran Dai Quang
: (retranslated): Mr Putin, comrades.
Thank you for accepting our invitation to take part in the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting. We realise that you have a very busy agenda, including the preparations for the elections in the beginning of next year but you still came to see us and we appreciate this very much.
We highly value your participation in the current meeting and we are sure that it will make an important contribution to its results.
It is unfortunate that you will not be able to pay an official state visit to our country this time but we are looking forward to your visit any other time.
Using this opportunity I would like to thank you again for the warm reception you gave us last June.
I would also like to thank you for your understanding and assistance to our people who suffered damage from the Damri typhoon recently. We highly appreciate the aid extended to us by Russia as well as other countries and international organisations in disaster relief.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: First of all, I would like to express my condolences over the loss of life and large-scale destruction caused by the typhoon in Vietnam’s central regions. As for humanitarian assistance, it is absolutely natural, especially for such long-standing friends as Russia and Vietnam. I am sure that Vietnam can cope with these problems on its own and this is just a sign of attention and respect for the Vietnamese people.
Comrade Tran Dai Quang, I would like to congratulate you on your country’s the successful hosting of the APEC forum. I am convinced that the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting will produce results and allow us to discuss the most important issues.
Our bilateral cooperation is making steady headway on the basis of the principles of comprehensive strategic partnership. During your official visit to the Russian Federation last June we held detailed talks and now have an opportunity to discuss the implementation of the agreements we reached then.
Thank you for the invitation to pay an official visit to Vietnam.

Meeting with President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet with you again.
I remember that you had to cut short your trip to Russia due to a terrorists’ attack on your country. I remember that you told me before the departure that you had to restore order and fight back the terrorists. I want to congratulate you on having achieved that. I have to say, countering terrorism today is one of our common tasks, objectives and challenges. In this regard, we are ready, as we have agreed, to develop our relations, including the military and technical cooperation.

Of course, we need to lay a special emphasis on economic ties. Unfortunately, they are at a fairly low level even though a certain growth in bilateral trade can be observed this year.
I am very glad to meet with you again, Mr President.
President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte
(transcript):
Thank you, Mr President, President Putin, sir. I am very happy to see you again, this time with double enthusiasm and gratitude of my country of the Philippines. I really wanted to stay longer at that time, but as I explained to you it was very important for me to go home because I had to declare martial law. And it was really an ISIS-inspired raid on the city and they wanted to take control. So I had to declare martial law and send my troops there to quell the rebellion. And I was able to prove to everybody that the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the national police would take care of our country. And there are still pockets of resistance and the mopping up operation but it continues to be a very dangerous city. And I would like to convey to you the gratitude of the Filipino people for your timely assistance, especially the trucks and arms that you sent because we had to replenish the supplies which were getting low. According to my soldiers the arms that you sent are very accurate and they were able to take care of the snipers that abounded in the city. I lost almost all of my troops because of the snipers, which were covered in buildings just like in Syria. There’s a new kind of war and the cover is cement, concrete and iron. So we had to hurt them just like in the other places in the Middle East because we had to wipe it out, building for building.
And that is my dream that before I finish my presidency I want to build a strong Armed Forces and strong police. It is very important for you to know that we are buying our arms from Russia this time. Because at the time we were short of arms for the police. And we wanted to buy it from America, but because of the almost equal power of the US Congress and the President it is only stymied by the legislators, so the 23,000 that I ordered were scrapped. And your timely assistance to my country helped us to replenish the old arms. And we have the new stock, so the new arms that we got from you, sir, were given to the special units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In a way, you had us turn the tide and to shorten the war there because all of your assistances.
So again I thank you very much, the Russian people and the President. We will remember your help.
Vladimir Putin: Weapons are very important, but what is most important is your resolve and the readiness of the Armed Forces, security agencies and the police to counteract the terrorist threat. So I congratulate you.

I am glad to have this opportunity to meet and talk with you.
Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): Thank you for your kind words on our election victory. Thanks to this, we can resume our efforts. I hope we will continue to cooperate, Vladimir.
It is nice to know that we are meeting for the 20th time today.
Based on the agreement we reached in Nagato, special flights were organised so that the families of the deceased residents of the [Kuril] Islands could visit the graves of their relatives and tour the districts on the four islands where we are cooperating. In the context of the successful implementation of these plans, I would like to move forward our future efforts focused on the peace treaty.
As for the planned cross-year in 2018, we are making energetic preparations for it. Next year, Russia will host the FIFA World Cup, which the Japanese team will attend. I would like the next year to provide more reasons for strengthening cooperation between our nations.
Speaking about the international agenda, I am ready to exchange opinions on our cooperation to denuclearise the Korean Peninsula.
Vladimir Putin: We look forward to seeing you at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and at the opening of the Russian-Japanese cross-years at the Bolshoi Theatre.

President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated):
Mr President,
Most recently, we spoke over the phone. You congratulated me on the successful holding of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China and my re-election to the post of its General Secretary. Once again, thank you.
This is the fifth time we have met this year, and we are steering China-Russia relations along the path of healthy and sustainable development. Great development results are there for everyone to see. Both our countries strongly support each other in protecting the key interests of our countries, and political mutual trust is getting stronger. We have a truly trust-based strategic partnership, and our practical cooperation brings new records.
The substantial part of talks on concluding an agreement on trade and economic cooperation between China and the EAEU has been completed. There are important results on harmonising the One Belt and One Road initiative with the EAEU. We can already count on trade exceeding $80 billion.
We have achieved notable successes in implementing major projects, such as building a gas pipeline along the Eastern route, developing a heavy helicopter, and maintaining comprehensive cooperation in the nuclear sphere.
The years of media exchanges have come to a successful end, and our cultural ties are intensifying.
Success in international affairs demonstrates our responsibility as global powers, demonstrates a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, justice, and cooperation. There comes a new era of China-specific socialism.
Russia is confidently moving along the path of growing power. At this critical moment for the development of both our countries, we are meeting to explore new opportunities for the development of China-Russia relations.
In the coming years, together with our Russian partners, we will, shoulder to shoulder, steadily develop our relations at a high level, to contribute more effectively to the security and development of both countries, and to ensure more reliably peace in the world and the region.
Thank you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: My friend, President of the People's Republic of China, comrade Xi Jinping,
I would like to congratulate you, this time in person, on the successful holding of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party and your election to the post of General Secretary of the Central Committee. The results of the congress confirmed not only your high standing, but also the wide support of the Chinese people for your policy.
With regard to Russia, strategic comprehensive interaction between Russia and China remains our foreign policy priority.
China is our largest trade and economic partner. Your visit to Moscow this summer was an event of key importance. Our efforts were not in vain. Trade grew by more than 35 percent. All this is good news.
You mentioned a number of major projects in various spheres. We will work hard on them, and look for new areas of cooperation. I am confident we will identify and implement them.
I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting.
