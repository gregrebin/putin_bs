President of Vietnam Tran Dai Quang
: (retranslated): Mr Putin, comrades.
Thank you for accepting our invitation to take part in the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting. We realise that you have a very busy agenda, including the preparations for the elections in the beginning of next year but you still came to see us and we appreciate this very much.
We highly value your participation in the current meeting and we are sure that it will make an important contribution to its results.
It is unfortunate that you will not be able to pay an official state visit to our country this time but we are looking forward to your visit any other time.
Using this opportunity I would like to thank you again for the warm reception you gave us last June.
I would also like to thank you for your understanding and assistance to our people who suffered damage from the Damri typhoon recently. We highly appreciate the aid extended to us by Russia as well as other countries and international organisations in disaster relief.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: First of all, I would like to express my condolences over the loss of life and large-scale destruction caused by the typhoon in Vietnam’s central regions. As for humanitarian assistance, it is absolutely natural, especially for such long-standing friends as Russia and Vietnam. I am sure that Vietnam can cope with these problems on its own and this is just a sign of attention and respect for the Vietnamese people.
Comrade Tran Dai Quang, I would like to congratulate you on your country’s the successful hosting of the APEC forum. I am convinced that the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting will produce results and allow us to discuss the most important issues.
Our bilateral cooperation is making steady headway on the basis of the principles of comprehensive strategic partnership. During your official visit to the Russian Federation last June we held detailed talks and now have an opportunity to discuss the implementation of the agreements we reached then.
Thank you for the invitation to pay an official visit to Vietnam.
