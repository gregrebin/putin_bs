Opening Remarks at a Meeting of the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation with Foreign States
March 31, 2006
18:56
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear colleagues,
As is tradition, at this first meeting of the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation this year we will examine last year’s results and outline promising future directions for military-technical cooperation.
I want to start by saying that Russia’s military exports have reached a new milestone. We over-fulfilled our plan for 2005 by 20 percent and our exports exceeded $6 billion. This is an absolute record for us in recent times and I congratulate you on this result.
This result was made possible by well-coordinated work at every level. Along with the state intermediary – Rosoboronexport – the other participants in military-technical cooperation also worked to a very high standard. Among them I would name the MiG Corporation, the Machine-Building Design Bureau, the Machine-Building Development and Production Company and the Instrument-Making Design Bureau.
To say a few words on the new participants in military-technical cooperation who have received authorisation to export spare parts, they are not only moving confidently into foreign markets but are increasingly active in developing their own niches. The companies with the best results in this respect are Sukhoi, Moscow-based Salyut and the Urals Optics and Mechanics Plant. I hope that this positive growth will continue and increase.
We expanded into some new export markets in 2005. We had set this kind of expansion as one of our priority tasks in this area. Russia exported military goods to a total of 61 different countries last year. The People’s Republic of China and India remain our biggest partners.
Among last year’s successes I would name the promotion of our naval technology and equipment and increasingly active cooperation with the members of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and the CIS and with countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle and Near East.
One of the examples of our work to enter new export markets is the agreements signed during my recent visit to Algeria. These agreements provide for large deliveries of Russian military equipment and arms and all the defence industry companies engaged in carrying out these orders should work in a planned and systematic manner.
Overall, Russian defence industry companies saw their order portfolios increase considerably in 2005. These are orders that have been placed rather than contracts actually carried out, but we are nonetheless talking of an increase of 61 percent.
Important changes have been made to the laws regulating military-technical cooperation. Decree No. 1062 that was issued in September 2005, for example, clarifies the distribution of responsibility in the management vertical and removes excessive red tape. I hope that the benefits are already making themselves felt in practice.
I am sure that these measures will make military-technical cooperation more effective, spur more dynamic growth in the Russian defence industry and provide new incentives for promising scientific and applied research in what is a very important sector for the state.
I would like now to give a brief overview of the main tasks today in the sector. As before, one of the priorities is precise and timely fulfilment of all contractual commitments and work to improve post-sale service. These are basic tasks that require constant attention from the defence industry companies themselves and from the relevant state bodies. It is important to continue developing modern forms of cooperation such as working jointly with our partners to create new arms. This kind of cooperation can comprise many different stages, from working on a product’s development to carrying out series production and organising deliveries for our own needs and for the needs of third countries. You are all aware that if we do not produce equipment for our own needs, selling it to third countries can be complicated.
Of course, we must also make more active use of the potential of joint ventures in the military-technical cooperation sector. By integrating our partners’ possibilities we can better meet today’s demands and can take our products to new levels of competitiveness. Aside from anything else, we also are all well aware that this raises the level of trust between the countries that are our partners.
These are just some of the issues that we need to examine at today’s meeting. We are also to discuss the current situation and future prospects for military-technical cooperation with individual countries, as we usually do at our meetings.

Opening Words at Meeting with Medallists at the IX Winter Paralympics
March 31, 2006
16:45
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear friends,
I would like to wish you all a warm welcome and congratulate you on your outstanding results at the IX Winter Paralympics.
It is no exaggeration to say that the results you have achieved are a real sensation. Not so long ago, in 2002, our Paralympics team had an honourable result and took fourth place overall, but just two years later, in Turin, you have confidently taken the lead over 38 other national teams, winning the most gold medals and topping the overall medals table with 33 medals, including 13 gold medals. Our athletes did not even take part in every event. We are all genuinely proud of you and your achievements. The Paralympics team has not only defended Russia’s sporting honour but has also, through its hard work and talent, laid the foundations of an excellent tradition of victory.
The Paralympics movement is gaining popularity and winning new fans all around the world. The number of people taking part in the movement is rising all the time and it is not by chance that the Paralympics in Turin are already being called one of this year’s most significant sports events.
The hard work you put into your training and the innovative methods you use are important factors, but they are not the only components of your victories. I would like to take this opportunity today to thank all of Russia’s Paralympics athletes and to thank the wonderful team of trainers and specialists who work with them. They have shared with the athletes not only their professional knowledge and experience but have also, without any doubt, given them a bit of their own soul.
Progress has been made over recent years in developing adaptation sport and the Paralympics movement in Russia. Our athletes now compete regularly in international events, and the network of sports facilities, groups and clubs for people with disabilities is expanding and has now reached more than 1,000. But we know that a great deal still remains to be done and that we still have much to learn. The state is committed to continued support for special sports programmes and infrastructure, including children’s and young people’s centres, and to providing athletes with the modern equipment you need. We very much hope, I very much hope, dear friends, that your experience and authority, your recommendations, will help us to carry out this work.
In conclusion, I would once again like to thank all the members of Russia’s Paralympics team. Your victories are not just sporting achievements but are also events of great personal significance for each one of you. “Breaking all Limits” – such was the motto of the IX Paralympics. Your achievements are fine examples indeed of people’s immense inner strength and ability to overcome difficulties and break down the barriers. From the bottom of my heart I wish you new achievements and victories in the future.
When I met here earlier with the Olympics team, I informed the athletes that we, together with members of the business community, had decided that along with the official Olympics premium, the participants would also each receive a high-class car. This works out at about $65,000 on average. I would like to tell you now that each of you will also be recompensed with a similar sum. We have this possibility and we will definitely present this money to you and you will be able to decide yourselves how to use it. I know that many of you would like to put it towards buying a home. As with the trainers of the country’s Olympics team, the trainers of the Paralympics team will also receive, in addition to what the state promised, an additional premium of around $25,000.
Once again I offer you my sincere congratulations and I wish you all the very best. Thank you very much.
