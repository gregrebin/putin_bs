Meeting with WorldSkills professional skills competition’s Russian national team.
The WorldSkills international non-profit movement was created to promote blue-collar professions and the development of vocational education by organising and holding professional skills competitions. Russia joined the movement in May 2012.
In 2019, the WorldSkills Competition world championship will be held in Kazan. This decision was made at the movement’s general assembly in Sao Paolo. Paris and Charleroi, Belgium also competed for the right to host the championships.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I know you have moved 27 positions up compared to our last performance, taking into account that this is only the second time our national team is taking part in this competition. This is a good result, thanks to your professionalism. I’m not going to say now how important it is, but you know that we have set a goal for at least half of Russian vocational schools to train professionals according to the highest global standards by 2020. I hope that if we move forward just as you demonstrated, then this objective will not only be met, but also surpassed.
You know that in 2019, the WorldSkills world championship for professional skills and engineering professions will be held in Russia. It would be great if we perform well at the championship we host. I think we have all the prerequisites for it. And I very much hope that you will not give up this work, but on the contrary, will inspire others through your example.
