Meeting with President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.
President of Russian Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I would like to welcome you in Moscow and thank you once again for accepting the invitation to come to the Russian capital.
Of course, the serious situation and difficult developments in Nagorno-Karabakh were the most important events of the past year. But I would like to express satisfaction with the fact that we still managed to stop the hostilities, the bloodshed. And, as we have just said regarding our work today, the peacekeeping mission is fulfilling its function and the situation in general is gradually coming back to normal. I believe it is very important that today we worked out a joint statement based on a striving to settle the situation for the long-term.
But beyond the events linked with the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, we also have a bilateral agenda. In this context, I would like to note once again and to express gratitude to you for our joint efforts to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War. This was a momentous event for our countries, for all countries in the post-Soviet space, because we were fighting for the freedom and independence of our common homeland.
Today, relations between Russia and Azerbaijan are making steady headway. This primarily concerns the economic component. We have many areas of cooperation and many similar interests in the economy.
I am hoping that overall our efforts to settle the situation in the South Caucasus will also be useful for our bilateral ties, as I have mentioned. I believe this settlement will help us promote our relations and make them even more consistent not only in the economy but also in the humanitarian field.
I would like to thank you again for being in Moscow today.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev: Thank you, Mr President.
It is always a pleasure to be in the Russian capital, and I would like to once again express my gratitude for the invitation and the initiative to hold this trilateral meeting. It was very practical, and I think productive because we were able to sign a Statement following the meeting.
This is the second statement we have signed, two months after the war ended, which in essence draws a line under last year’s developments.
The Statement aims to create a new situation in our region, to unblock transportation lines. This is critical because it allows Azerbaijan to have transport links to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic through Armenia after more than three decades. And Armenia will have railway access to Russia and Iran via Azerbaijan. We will also have access to the Turkish market through the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. In addition, Russian and Turkish railway lines can be linked. This Statement opens up tremendous opportunities.
I know that the working group we have set up today will operate effectively and will regularly report to us on the progress of these projects. There are several projects there, not just one. I am sure they will all be implemented.
I would like to thank you once again for your personal involvement in stopping the hostilities and signing the November 9 Statement. I think that you as the leader of Russia and as Armenia’s and Azerbaijan’s neighbour have once again displayed willpower, determination and wisdom. Today’s meeting, at your initiative, is further proof of how much you focus on this issue. Naturally, this makes us happy because any positive developments in the region largely depend on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict being settled, and now the conflict is already history. New potential is opening up which we could not have imagined before.
As for bilateral relations, the trade decrease was not really significant despite the difficult pandemic-related year. I am sure that we will make up for that this year. The agenda is long and broad, including in the economy. Politically, Azerbaijan and Russia have long been strategic partners, and Russia’s involvement in stopping the war and in the peacekeeping mission shows that these are indeed long-term relations of strategic partnership that are maintaining ongoing progress.
You noted cultural cooperation between our countries. This has always been marked by sincerity, efficacy and targeting specific results. We are committed to efficient cooperation in all other areas this year and in the years to follow.
Meanwhile, the situation between Armenia and Azerbaijan that had been evolving for many years has finally been resolved, and I am confident that the Armenian side will make no attempts to reconsider the November 9 Statement so that both nations can find the will and wisdom to think about the future and reconciliation.
Thank you once again for the invitation and for this initiative.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Meeting with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan
Vladimir Putin met with Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.

With Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I would like to welcome you again – this time to our bilateral meeting. I would like to thank you for agreeing to come to Moscow today.
I believe that indeed, despite the problems you mentioned, which remain outstanding, I hope we will still be able to come to terms on the remaining problems including the humanitarian issues. I think that in general this meeting has been useful for determining the future of the region and the development of relations in the region, primarily between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
I will say that we have certainly had and will have allied relations in all respects and we are close partners in many international organisations.
However, today we spoke at length about the economy. I would like to mention in this context that despite the complicated year and despite all the difficulties, we still increased our trade by almost 4 percent, 3.9 percent in January-October, 2020.
All this makes it possible to hope that as the settlement of the situation around Nagorno-Karabakh moves forward, we will make decisions that will definitely benefit the Armenian people, the Armenian state and our bilateral ties.
Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr President.
Today, we actually spent the whole day together. For over four hours, we talked in a trilateral format, and I am happy that after these talks, we have at least some results, and these results are important.
As I have said, I am confident that the implementation of the agreements formulated in our joint Statement can seriously change the economic potential of our region and substantially enhance its investment appeal.
However, as I also said, I think these economic issues are being complicated by the lack of progress on humanitarian matters. And, of course, as I said, the most sensitive issues for us and I think for all of us, are humanitarian matters linked with the prisoners of war, missing people, and the exchange of bodies. I would like to thank you for upholding and supporting this position.
Of course, your personal contribution to the peace process has always been very tangible and is particularly special now, after the relevant events. I hope relations between Armenia and Russia will become deeper against the backdrop of these events. Russia has been and remains our main strategic ally in the security sphere. Of course, we still need to discuss not only the future of our region but also the agenda of our bilateral ties.
I am happy to have this meeting and this opportunity to discuss everything today.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Press statements following talks with President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues, both the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia, for agreeing to come to Moscow today and have a meeting to discuss issues related to fulfilling the terms of our peace agreement of November 9, 2020.
We came to the conclusion that overall, the terms of this agreement have been observed and there have been no serious incidents. Russia’s peacekeeping group is meeting its obligations in full to both parties. As I said at the beginning of this meeting, more than 48,000 displaced persons and refugees have already returned to Nagorno-Karabakh. The work to rebuild infrastructure, power facilities, housing and social infrastructure is in full swing.

Meeting with Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan
January 11, 2021
I find this meeting extremely important and useful because we managed to agree and sign a joint statement on the developments in the region. I am talking about specific steps to establish economic ties and develop infrastructure projects. A working group will be created for this purpose and will be headed by the deputy prime ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia. They will soon create ad hoc sub-groups within the working group and present specific plans for developing the transport infrastructure and the economy in the region.
I am convinced that implementing these agreements will benefit both the Armenian and Azerbaijani nations and, without a doubt, will be helpful for the region in general and, therefore, serve the interests of the Russian Federation as well.
Thank you.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev: Mr President Putin,
First of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation and the initiative to hold this meeting. I also share your opinion that this meeting was very important for ensuring the further sustainable and safe development of our region.
Two months have passed since the ceasefire was announced, and the fact that the leaders of the three countries that signed the Statement of November 9–10 have gathered in Moscow today shows that we are willing to achieve results and draw a line under the actions that took place in September-November. The statement that was signed today reflects our intentions, because one of the items in the statement following the cessation of hostilities was on the unblocking of transport connections.
This is an important area that will help us achieve the dynamics to resume the region’s development and enhance security, and the opening of transport links meets the interests of the people of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia and our other neighbours. I am sure that the neighbouring countries will also join our efforts to resume transport corridors and develop a diverse network of transport arteries in our region.
We must continue striving to find fields of activities that will produce quick effects and are oriented to results.
Overall, I would like to say that the Statement of November 9 and 10 (Azerbaijani time) is being successfully implemented. Many items in this statement have been fulfilled. The Russian peacekeeping mission is working effectively. Except for a few minor incidents, there have been no serious grounds for concern during the past two months.
All this creates the confidence that, as President Putin said, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict will remain in the past and that we must think about the future – how to live next to each other, how to strive for unblocking transport arteries and enhancing regional stability and security in the future.
Mr President Putin, I would like to thank you once again for the invitation and I believe our meeting has been very useful and productive.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan: Mr President Putin,
First, let me thank you for all the efforts you are making to restore stability and security in our region and to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
Unfortunately, this conflict has not been settled even up to this day. Of course, we have ensured a ceasefire, but many issues are still outstanding and must be resolved. One is the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, and we, Armenia, are certainly ready to continue the talks as the co-chairs in the OSCE Minsk Group, in part, on this issue.
Unfortunately, today we have not settled the issue of prisoners of war, and this is the most sensitive and serious issue because it is a humanitarian issue and we agreed to continue working in this area. But we believe that unfortunately item 8 of our joint Statement, for instance, is not being fully carried out, and I hope we will be able to reach a specific decision on this as soon as possible.
I can say that the Statement we signed today is very important indeed. I will say that the implementation of the agreements in this Statement could change the economic profile of our region and that the economic changes could produce even more reliable security guarantees. We will certainly work constructively to this end, but, as I said, unfortunately, it is impossible to resolve all the problems at one meeting.
I hope we will continue moving forward. I would like to emphasise again that for us the main issues today are humanitarian, notably, the exchange of prisoners of war as envisaged in item 8 of our November 9–10 joint Statement.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I would like to once again thank my colleagues for today’s generally constructive work.
Thank you.
