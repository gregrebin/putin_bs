President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am very happy to welcome you to Moscow.
I am pleased to recall once again that Russia is Finland’s leading trading partner. Our position in the top spot is secure, but there are still things that I’m sure are of mutual concern. Our trade turnover has decreased by more than 12 percent.
In this regard, I am very grateful that you accepted our invitation and came to Russia with a large group of businesspeople. These are entrepreneurs whose work to a large extent influences the state of the economy and available jobs. Naturally, your visit is a very timely one.

February 12, 2013
Of course, we need to think about and analyse the current situation together, along with our Finnish colleagues. We need to think about what we should do to ensure that the situation does not deteriorate, but rather improves.
Despite the ongoing crisis in the eurozone and a certain decline in energy consumption, we have nevertheless built up a good foundation, and we must take advantage of it.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we will be able to play hockey during this visit, but we will definitely continue our sporting tradition.
Welcome!
President of Finland Sauli Niinistö (retranslated): Thank you very much for the invitation, Mr President – or perhaps I should refer to you as the master centre forward?
I am very glad that Russia holds the first place among our trading partners, and we will make every effort to ensure that this remains the case.
I would like to say that representatives of Finland’s business community appreciate the fact that you will receive them today. This is both important and significant.
I completely agree with you that Europe is living through very difficult times, but we have had tough times before and always survived. For example, Finland was affected by a very deep recession in the 1990s, and Russia had major financial problems in 1998. However, we managed to overcome these difficulties.
I will continue our sporting tradition with great pleasure but I have to warn you that I have been training very hard.
(In Russian) Mr President, we are expecting you in Finland this summer.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I definitely will come.

Working meeting with Head of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Igor Artemyev
Mr Artemyev briefed the President on the situation in the petrochemicals market and the agency’s efforts to create a favourable market environment in the fishing industry in the Far East.

With Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Head Igor Artemyev.
The discussion also touched on protecting Russian interests with regard to fishing, processing and supply of fish to the Russian market.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Artemyev, you wanted to report to me on the situation in the petrochemicals market and the efforts that your agency is taking to create a more favourable market environment in the Far East, including in the fishing industry.
Head of The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Igor Artemyev
: Mr President, per your instructions, over the past three years we have been developing the legal framework for regulation of the petroleum products. The legal base was finally formed two years ago. After that the judicial inquiries into our major oil companies were completed, and the highest Russian courts gave their support to the Russian lawmakers.
We developed a system of regulation based on market principles, which is as good as the best European practices and which enables us to stabilise the prices for petrochemicals. In other words, if someone in the Russian Federation today tries to apply high monopoly prices or unfair competition, such a position will not be shared by the courts or the legislature, or by law enforcement agencies.
In recent months, the Russian Government has increased excise taxes. This was done to supplement the road funds’ revenue to build new roads. However, the prices have changed by exactly the same amount or even less. In general the growth in prices last year was below inflation for most items. We experienced a crisis in the past, but we don’t foresee a new recession now. Moreover, the Government has every opportunity to use the existing practices to provide a quick response, and to ensure within a few days that the prices remain stable.
Naturally, demand will increase in the spring due to the sowing campaign. We can expect a small rise in prices, but it will be within a few percentage points, no more.
As for the Far East, Mr President, this is a major issue. In the 1990s the Russian fishing industry was rather neglected, unfortunately, and it appears that many foreign companies secretly bought up our fleet.
At the same time, the law on foreign investment in strategic sectors, which came into force in April 2008, required all such foreign companies to submit applications, register and obtain the consent of the Government Commission on Foreign Investment.
The reason is that no major country in the world allows foreigners to produce its biological resources except by special permission. Our national resources too should belong to our fishermen and the people who live in the Far East, on the Barents Sea coast, and so on.
It turned out that foreign companies have bought up the majority of our fleet through secret agreements, without informing Russian people, the Russian Government or the Russian Parliament.
It took me two years to collect this information, and when the Government, headed by you at the time, resolved to address this issue, it became clear that many companies were willing to leave.
In fact, a number of foreign companies are selling their assets right now. They may agree to invest in fish processing on the coast or they may wish to build a fleet – both options are legal. But as far as the catch is concerned, that is our national treasure and our national interests.
Also, interestingly enough, we discovered a large number of established cartels during this investigation, including those created by foreigners, which coordinated the supply of fish to the Russian market, limiting supplies and regulating prices; that is, they were engaged in illegal activities in order to artificially raise the prices in Russia.
Today, the investigation is ongoing. We hope to complete it next year. As you know, we have Article 178 of the Criminal Code, which, I hope, will be applied against the perpetrators of this illegal activity.

Meeting with representatives of Russian and Finnish business communities
Vladimir Putin and President of Finland Sauli Niinistö met with representatives of Russian and Finnish business communities.
February 12, 2013
15:30
Meeting participants discussed topical issues that concern Russian and Finnish entrepreneurs, in particular the prospects for increasing trade and simplifying their countries’ respective visa regimes.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, dear friends, I am glad to warmly welcome you to Moscow once again.
Mr President and I went through virtually the entire agenda of our cooperation. Naturally, its foundation is economic. For that reason I am very pleased to welcome representatives of Finnish companies here today.
I am pleased to note that Russia remains your country’s main trading partner. Total Finnish investments in Russia amount to over $3 billion. However, our level of trade has slightly decreased, from $17 billion to $15 billion. We attribute this to certain difficulties in both global and European economies. It is also connected with the fluctuation of both the dollar’s and the euro’s exchange rates. We believe that we have the capacity not only to return to our previous levels of trade, but also to exceed them in the coming two to three years.

Finnish companies work successfully and at significant levels in a number of sectors of Russia’s economy, including energy, transport, communications and, of course, the forest industry.
Last year, a record number of people – 12.7 million – crossed the Russian-Finnish border. We agreed to continue working on liberalising our visa regimes, in the light of the fact that this creates the very best conditions for the development of business contacts.
Your work, ladies and gentlemen, constitutes the foundation which underpins the prosperity of our countries. It creates new jobs, provides people with work and the opportunity to earn money for themselves and their families, and generates budget revenues at all levels.
Our Government is now preparing to hold a meeting of our intergovernmental commission. And of course this meeting with business representatives is particularly timely. I mean a forum where you can directly express your desires and views about the level and quality of cooperation.
Welcome.
President of Finland Sauli Niinistö (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you for agreeing to meet with representatives of the Finnish business community. I can assure you that we in Finland value this very highly.
We are united in our desire to further increase trade, develop trade relations between our countries, and to overcome the small lag that has developed.
As you said, Finnish companies have invested very actively in Russia. I must admit that I also came here with the goal of inviting Russian companies to invest in Finland.
Human contacts between ordinary, average people play a very important role, and not only in economic relations where their value is well-known. These contacts play a very important role in allowing neighbours to get to know each other and each others’ habits, and this is very important.
It is very positive sign that we can simplify our visa regimes and the system for obtaining work permits, especially for young people. I am sure that this is the correct way to approach the future, as well as the right way to start achieving the goals you mentioned earlier.
