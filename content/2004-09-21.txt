President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr President, dear colleagues, allow me once again to wish you a warm welcome to the Russian capital.
I would like to repeat what a positive assessment I give Russian-Korean relations. They have reached a new, high quality. This is absolutely in the interests of our peoples and corresponds to their desire to live in friendship and harmony and to cooperate with each other in all areas. The cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea aims to strengthen peace and security in North-East Asia. Developing our ties with the Republic of Korea is one of our foreign policy priorities in the Asian region. Our work together is not directed against anyone else but aims only at strengthening security and expanding the opportunities for cooperation between our two countries and between all the countries of the region.
Furthermore, I am absolutely certain that developing our cooperation with the Republic of Korea is a good contribution to international security.
We are very happy to see you, Mr President, and your colleagues here in Moscow. I am sure that our work together will be fruitful and will benefit our peoples. We wish you a very warm welcome to Moscow.
President Roh Moo Hyun: First of all, I would like to thank you, Mr President, and the Russian people for the warm welcome I and the Korean delegation have been given. During our talks yesterday evening and this morning we came to some important agreements on cooperation between our two countries.
I think that it is the particular understanding you and your government have shown with regard to my visit that has made this possible.
Korea and Russia established diplomatic relations 120 years ago, and the first Korean community in Russia was established 140 years ago, but then there came a break in our relations. Over the fourteen years since we restored diplomatic relations between our two countries, however, we have developed our bilateral ties very successfully.
We, along with the Korean people, are completely satisfied with the pace and level of cooperation and the development of ties between our two countries.
I would like to note that many Korean firms are especially interested in working with Russian partners, particularly after you became president and Russia has become a lot more stable in all areas, including politically and in the economic and trade spheres, and also because Russia is now undergoing successful development.
Russia is an important player in the international community in general, but in our region, in North-East Asia, Russia has an especially important role. Russia is very important for peace and prosperity, but it also has a particularly important economic role in our region.
I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank the Russian Government for playing such an important part in the six-nation talks and in peaceful settlement of the crucial issues involved.
If we consider just how much Russia and Korea have in common in many areas, including in international politics and in the economy, I think we could say that the prospects for cooperation between our two countries are as sacred for us.
