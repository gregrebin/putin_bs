The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Vladimir Nikolaevich!
I am delighted to welcome you to the Kremlin and to meet with you to discuss bilateral relations.
I am also glad to be able to congratulate you on winning an international award for strengthening relations between the Orthodox peoples. This is a tribute to your personal efforts in working for the spiritual unity of our countries and our peoples. And, of course, such work is always essential for the development of bilateral relations. We will have the opportunity to talk more about this.
Once again, welcome.
President of Moldova Vladimir Voronin: Thank you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, for the opportunity to meet.
In the last two years the trend in our relations has been positive. We are gradually moving towards a greater degree of integration and a genuinely strategic partnership. The agreements we reached at summit meetings in Minsk and then in Dushanbe have provided the basis of our accord.
I think that today we will discuss bilateral relations to ensure that they continue to evolve positively for our countries and our peoples.
