Meeting with President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Tibilov, friends, good afternoon.
Today, we will take a step forward in developing the legal base underpinning our relations with South Ossetia, and will advance on the integration road too and in developing our alliance by signing the agreement on alliance and integration.
I wish you a warm welcome to Moscow. I know that a lot of work has been accomplished of late so that we can carry out our plans. Of course, there is still more to do and we will have a good opportunity today to discuss the current state of affairs in terms of developing the social sector and economy, and the additional steps we need to take over the coming period.
President of The Republic of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov
: Mr Putin, thank you for today’s meeting. We will sign the agreement on alliance and integration today and we know that only by developing our alliance and integration can we respond to the challenges and threats the modern world puts before us. 
We know that the Russian Federation is our people and republic’s only guarantor, and I am particularly happy that this event is taking place today, on what is such a symbolic date in the Russian people’s life. It was exactly a year ago that the agreement was signed by which the people of Crimea and Sevastopol, having expressed their free will, found their Motherland.
We welcomed that decision right from the first. South Ossetia welcomes all of Russia’s political decisions and we always stand at your side. I want to thank you for the huge support that Russia is giving South Ossetia. We will have the chance today to give you a brief overview of some of our results and achievements in 2014. Russia is helping us to raise our living standards.
I particularly want to thank you for the invitation to take part in celebrating the 70th anniversary of victory [in the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War].
On behalf of all the people of South Ossetia, I want to thank you for everything you are doing for us and, as is our tradition, wish you good health and Russia’s prosperity. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
