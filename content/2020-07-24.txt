President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Let us begin today's meeting, the conference of the permanent members of the Security Council. I would like to suggest discussing several matters today.
First of all, I would like to ask the Minister of Defence to report on the progress of the preparations for the Naval Parade. The entire country is waiting for this festive event, which will demonstrate not only the growing power of our Navy, but also hail the capabilities of our shipbuilders, which is extremely important for the development of the industry.
The second issue that I would like to discuss and would ask the Prime Minister to speak about is the progress of our negotiations with foreign partners regarding the summer tourist season. I am referring to the problems caused by the coronavirus infection, and the requirements the Government of the Russian Federation will adopt for foreign travel for the immediate future.
Finally, we will discuss our relations with some of the CIS countries and, importantly, the situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, which is highly sensitive for us.
