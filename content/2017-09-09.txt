Speech at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Infantino, friends,
Today, the 2018 FIFA World Cup is starting a tour around our country, a tour around Russia. It will last for 123 days, and the total distance to be covered during the journey will amount to 26,000 kilometres.
This will be the longest tour of the most important football trophy in history. And, hopefully, it will be the most exciting one. Because our country is second to none in terms of scale and diversity of nature, culture and traditions.

At the 2018 FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.
Symbolically, the tour forestalling the grand football event starts from the legendary Luzhiniki Arena. This stadium is known to all generations of sports fans and is connected with names of renowned athletes, and hundreds of sports records and achievements. I am certain that the thrilling atmosphere of exciting battles and remarkable victories has been preserved at Luzhniki following its grand-scale renovation.
The stadium will rightly become the main venue for the upcoming World Cup: it will host both the opening and the final matches of this long-anticipated contest. Such beautiful, comfortable, technically advanced arenas will be waiting for football players and fans in each Russian city participating in the World Cup.
Despite the extensive experience of hosting major international competitions, we are taking meticulous care in preparing for the World Cup. Football has always been the most popular mass sport in Russia and has the largest number of fans of all ages.
Our country has done a lot for the development of football as well. It has given rise to such outstanding members of the football family as Lev Yashin, Igor Netto, Renat Dasayev and Nikita Simonyan. I am sure that there will be new football heroes and new victories. I am sure that the national team will delight its fans.
I am convinced that the 2018 FIFA World Cup will give a strong impulse to the development of football and its material legacy will become a centre of attraction for a multi-million football brotherhood, as well as for young athletes who are as talented, full of strength and desire to show their worth, as the 1,500 sports schools students from across Russia who have gathered here today.
It is you and your peers who will carry on developing football in the not too distant future, performing in adult national contests, defending the colours of famous clubs, representing your Fatherland at international contests.
Now that Russia is hosting the planet’s main football tournament, we will have an opportunity to see our players better. We are looking forward to these exciting matches, honest battles of masters and the most sincere emotions. Today’s ceremony is only drawing this event nearer.
Good luck to all participants in the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup, and to all football fans –victories and outstanding achievements.
Have a happy journey!

Beginning of meeting with FIFA President Gianni Infantino
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Infantino,
We are very happy to see you at another stage, at the beginning of a new stage in preparations for the World Cup. You have seen how our young athletes, the future champions perceive this. You were absolutely right when you said that the Cup has a magic significance and a magic quality.
You and I have seen that the renovation of Luzhniki, the main World Cup arena, has been completed. And we were extremely glad to hear your high assessment.
I am aware that FIFA experts are closely following the work at other football arenas in other Russian cities. We will take every effort to complete everything on time and with high quality.
Four stadiums are ready, everything is on schedule, and financing has been provided in full. I strongly hope that your experts, who, as I have said, are monitoring the work closely, will continue supporting our efforts and together we will bring the preparations for the World Cup to completion, to the result we expect.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino (transcript from English): Thank you, President Putin. Of course, this stadium here, the Luzhniki Stadium, as well as the work, that the FIFA experts are following very closely in the other venues, shows not only the professionalism and the efficiency of Russia, but also the heart and passion.
So I was very happy to hear your words today as well as to see the preparation work, which is indeed going extremely well.
And the results that we can see already, in not only the four venues that you mentioned, but also in the others, which are almost completed, are exceptional.
This stadium, the Luzhniki Stadium, is a perfect example of what I want to say because it is not only a perfect football stadium, which is bringing together history with a façade and future with the interior.
But it has also an incredible, positive energy.
And you can feel it when you go down on the pitch.
And for those players, who will have to play there when this stadium is full, I don’t know how their knees will be going when they enter the pitch.
They have to prepare themselves really well.
But you can see, that from our side as well, we are happy, we are progressing, the adrenaline is growing, the trophy, with the Trophy Tour that starts now, will create another wave of enthusiasm in this country and around the world and I am the longer the more looking very much forward to next year, the World Cup in Russia.

Speech at gala concert in Red Square marking Moscow’s 870th anniversary.
Russian President Vladimir Putin: Muscovites, visitors to the city, Mr Prime Minister, Mr Sobyanin,
I would like to congratulate you all on City Day!
This day is always marked by grand and festive celebration, with people expressing their sincere love for Moscow, its centuries’ old history and its contemporary achievements, their pride for our beautiful capital – a dynamic, and innovative city, ready to face the future and invariably majestic in its ancient beauty.
Moscow is the centre of the Russian state. Serving as a gatherer of Russian lands, it grew and gained power slowly but profoundly and confidently. Here in Moscow different cultures and traditions concentrated and intertwined, solidifying the spiritual power of our multi-ethnic people.
History has confirmed the creative and uniting role of Moscow throughout the centuries. Moscow has rightly earned the respect and veneration it receives from the citizens of Russia.
Times and generations change but a warm, I would even say caring attitude to Moscow is a permanent value, as well as an interest in its development and transformation.
It is one of the most modern megacities in the world. It is open to implementing new extraordinary ideas, to investment in advanced research and bold business projects, to initiatives in culture and urban space development.
Moscow is a centre of attraction for gifted, hardworking and educated people who can cope with the fast and intense rhythm of the capital. For those who are moving forward, towards success, results and professional growth.
Prompt introduction of advanced technologies, effective development instruments, reliance on the residents’ initiative and intellectual and creative potential have become Moscow’s landmarks.
A large-scale reconstruction is underway here now. It was embarked on in line with the status of one of the world’s largest metropolises. Its priority goal is to enhance the comfort and quality of life of Moscow residents.
Reconstruction is always a difficult and troublesome matter, much like home renovation. It must begin sooner or later, and it is good that Moscow authorities have taken it up so resolutely while heeding residents’ advice.
Friends, the energy of Moscow’s renovation, its infrastructure and social projects have a tremendous significance for our country. The capital has always been at the forefront, it can achieve its ambitious goals. And today, as ever, Muscovites are at their best.
I wish you all the very best and hope that you will continue to boldly move forward. Health and well-being to you!
Greetings on Moscow Day!
