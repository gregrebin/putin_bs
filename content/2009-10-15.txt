The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Your Majesty, distinguished guests,
I would like first of all to welcome you to Moscow and the Kremlin. We are very pleased that you are visiting and we appreciate the fact that you are actively promoting the prospects of cooperation between our countries.
This is already your second visit. And today we are marking this visit with several remarkable events. First of all, following your visit we will adopt a joint declaration on the basis of our negotiations today and those between ministers which took place previously. Secondly, it is very good that we are reaching a new level of cooperation as demonstrated by the opening of a Russian embassy in Brunei Darussalam. This is also a very important event which I hope will strengthen and diversify our relations.
Our colleagues have worked very well and during your visit you have already had several meetings. We are very happy about this. I hope that these events and the contacts you have had will help develop our trade, strengthen our cooperation in culture and education, and help our relations attain a very high level.
I would like to once again cordially welcome you to Moscow. We are very glad that you are visiting and hope that this will strengthen relations between our countries and peoples as well as contribute to the development of our dialogue in the years to come.
