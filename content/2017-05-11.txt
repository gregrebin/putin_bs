President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, allow me to welcome you in Russia. I am very pleased to see you again.
We have special relations with Palestine and our ties have great significance to us. We spoke just now with our colleagues in Palestine, in Bethlehem, about the deep roots of the relations binding our two countries. And in recent history, our ties have always been very warm and trusting.

Press statements following Russian-Palestinian talks
May 11, 2017
I want to thank you, Mr President, for the attention that you pay to Russian-Palestinian relations and for the support you give to our compatriots living in Palestine and those who come to the holy places as pilgrims.
We have been working together for many years now on one of the world’s key issues today – a Middle East settlement
We have much to discuss, of course. It is a great pleasure to see you. I hope that your visit will be very productive.
PresidentofPalestineMahmoudAbbas (retranslated): Thank you very much.
We are indeed filled with joy at the opening of this wonderful centre in Bethlehem, which was built at your initiative. I note your personal attention, and Russia’s attention to strengthening Russian-Palestinian relations.
This year we are marking the 135th anniversary of the establishment of relations between Russia and Palestine. The Palestinian people take pride in these relations, from their establishment and to this day. This is because the Palestinians have always known that you are together with us, support us, and share similar positions. Russia’s position has always remained unchanged in this sense from the start of our ties and to this day.
Russia is distinguished by its firm stance, a position advocating the creation of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with its capital in East Jerusalem. We have always heard this position from you. It is firm, and you always maintain it.
It is not possible to resolve the Palestinian issue without Russia’s real participation. This is our aim and we always say this at all international platforms.
I would like to say again that we hope for your continued support. We have always said that Russia must stand beside us and take a similar position. I hope that this will be the case over the coming days and months, and that, through these efforts, we will ultimately achieve the creation of the State of Palestine.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Opening cultural and sports centre in Bethlehem

Vladimir Putin and President of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas participated via video link-up in the opening of a multifunctional cultural and sports centre.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Ms Mayor [of Bethlehem] Vera Baboun, Mr Bandak, friends,
It is a great pleasure to take part, together with President of Palestine Mr Abbas, in the official opening of this multifunctional centre, built by Russia in Bethlehem. Your city now has a modern centre, complete with the latest equipment, and with a music school, sports school, and a business centre.
This gives Palestine’s young people a new opportunity to develop their talents and abilities, learn more about Russian history, culture, and musical traditions, and train in wrestling and other sports.
The centre’s opening is a notable milestone in developing mutually advantageous relations between Russia and Palestine and is evidence of the genuine friendship between our peoples and countries.
Our cooperation goes back a long way. In the 19th century and early 20th century, Russia built dozens of schools and hospitals in Palestine. Thousands of Palestinians studied in the Soviet Union and Russia to become doctors, teachers and specialists in other fields, and serve their people honourably. Russia today allocates more than 100 state scholarships for students from Palestine every year.
I would like to note that a Russian science and culture centre has been successfully running in Bethlehem for several years now, as has a comprehensive Russian-Palestinian friendship school, where teaching is in the Russian language. In this sense, the newly opened centre will form another prominent part of the ‘Russian neighbourhood’.
We are grateful to Palestine’s government and to Mr Abbas for the support he has given these projects.
I would like once again to congratulate you on the centre’s opening and from all my heart wish the residents of Bethlehem and all Palestinians peace and prosperity.
Thank you for your attention.
Mahmoud Abbas (retranslated): Mr President, my friend,
First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to you, to the Russian Government and the friendly Russian people for your position and your consistent support for Palestinians and the Palestinian problem.
Also, I would like to thank you for this multifunctional complex, which has been built on your instructions. It is a great joy for us. We are grateful to you for making this present to Bethlehem and to the Palestinian people and for supporting the development of our cooperation in many spheres, including the economy, sport and culture.
Seeking to express my personal gratitude and the gratitude of the Palestinian people, we have decided to establish a governing body for this centre. The centre will be called the Vladimir Putin Association for the Development of Business and Cultural Cooperation in Palestine. As you know, we have decided to allocate a land plot for this centre on the street that bears your name, Vladimir Putin Street, which we opened during your previous visit to Bethlehem in 2012. In this context, we have resolved to create a governing body that will be comprised of top professionals who will be responsible for running this centre.
The opening of this centre is a great pride for us. We see it as a symbol of the further development and strengthening of bilateral relations in many areas. It will take its rightful place among the projects we have implemented. I am referring above all to the Russian School, the Russian Culture Centre in Bethlehem and the Russian Museum and Park Complex in Jericho. I would also like to say that the Russian Government has decided to finance the renovation of the historical centre of Star Street, which leads to the square adjacent to the Church of the Nativity.
In conclusion, I would like to thank everyone who helped us implement this project, primarily the Presidential Executive Office, the Russian company that implemented this project, the Russian Embassy and representative office in Palestine, as well as all Palestinians who helped us.
 Mr President, thank you.
