The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Today is a day of mourning in Russia for the victims of the terrorist attack in Moscow. Before we proceed, please observe a minuteâ€™s silence in memory of the victims.
The tragic events are over, but many problems remain. We pay a high price for both the weakness of the state and its inconsistent policy.
At the same time I wish to note and stress that Russia will never collude with the terrorists or yield to their blackmail. International terrorism is getting more and more brazen and increasingly brutal. Throughout the world terrorists voice threats to use means comparable to weapons of mass destruction. I declare, with full responsibility, that if anybody ever tries to use such means against this country, Russia will respond appropriately against all the places where the terrorists, the organisers of these crimes, and their ideological and financial supporters find themselves. I underscore, wherever they might be.
Due instructions to alter the plans for using the Armed Forces will be issued to the General Staff today.
I request that all Cabinet members submit their considerations based on an analysis of the situation in Moscow during the previous few days. Please, everybody in their line of work make the appropriate proposals to prevent future occurrences and minimise the effects of terrorist attacks, including the one in Moscow several days ago.
Above all, give first thought to aid for the families of the dead and all surviving victims. I ask Valentina Matviyenko to spearhead this work. I know she is already in contact with the Moscow Government.
