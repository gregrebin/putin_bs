Meeting on most pressing international issues.
Prior to his working trip to Pskov, Vladimir Putin held a meeting at the Vnukovo 2 airport terminal.
The discussion focused on the most pressing international issues – the spread of the coronavirus, trends in the global economy and the situation in the oil markets.
A number of federal ministers and heads of Russia’s leading oil and gas companies took part in the meeting.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
We know well that global financial and commodity markets are very sensitive to world-scale events.
In all appearances, we are witnessing exactly such a reaction on a global scale to what is happening with the so-called coronavirus. We have repeatedly stated that Russia is doing everything it can to fight this dangerous disease and that appropriate measures have been taken. I hope they will prove to be efficient. The situation is generally under control.
As for the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy, here we need to specifically focus on how to react to what is happening in this regard. This is the reason why I wanted to meet with you, with heads of our top oil and gas companies, to discuss how we are going to react to the developments in the global economy in connection with this coronavirus.
The negative consequences are already evident and affect the entire system of the global economic relations, virtually all countries because today the economies are highly interdependent and interconnected.
In the People’s Republic of China, which, as you know, was the first to confront the spread of the disease, business activity indexes published on Friday went beyond lows seen during the 2008 global crisis.
In turn, world stock indexes fell by over 10 percent. In this regard, the past week was the worst for global markets since the 2008 crisis.
It’s no surprise that against the backdrop of problems in the world’s leading economies and overall decline in demand, Brent crude oil dropped down to $50 per barrel by the end of the week. Let me remind you that it was at $70 per barrel at the start of the year.
It is certainly hard to predict how this trend will turn out in the long run, however, we must be prepared for all possible scenarios. I want to stress – the current oil prices are acceptable for the Russian budget and our economy. Let me remind you that our macroeconomic policy this year is based on a Brent crude oil price of $42.4 per barrel.
Moreover, our accumulated assets, including the National Welfare Fund, are sufficient to ensure a stable situation and that all budget and social commitments are met even if the situation in the global economy deteriorates.
The Central Bank Governor will correct me [if I am wrong] but I think the Bank of Russia has $563 billion in international reserves while the National Welfare Fund has $124 billion, which is 7.87 trillion rubles. Nevertheless, all this does not remove the need for our joint actions including with our foreign partners.
A meeting in the OPEC+ format will be held in Vienna next week. This mechanism, which we established with other leading oil producing nations, has already proved to be an efficient tool for ensuring long-term stability in the global energy markets. It has given us additional budget revenues and – this is key – offered possibilities for our oil extracting companies to invest in promising development projects.
I already said at the beginning that I wanted to hold this meeting in order to discuss this situation with you and hear your opinions on identifying further steps necessary to balance the global hydrocarbon markets.

At a memorial concert in honour of heroic soldiers of the 6th Paratroop Company.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades,
Dear paratrooper family members,
We have gathered today to honour the memory and bow to the heroic deeds of the paratroopers of the legendary 6th Company.
Twenty years have passed since those tragic and heroic events in the Argun Gorge but the valour of the soldiers and officers engaged in combat with militants who greatly outnumbered them will remain forever in the chronicles of military glory of our Fatherland.
Our country was going through very hard times back then – destructive domestic political confrontations, the collapse of the previous economic system and social sphere, the impoverishment of millions of people.
And, as is always the case, our weakness was used by external actors and forces. Russia had to fend off cruel attacks of international terrorism in the North Caucasus.
Without exaggeration, Russia’s destiny, the preservation of its integrity, the establishment of its citizens’ security were at stake. And the 6th Company soldiers stood to the last man defending their Motherland.
The young men came to serve in the Pskov Air Assault Division from different regions of the country, many of whom answered the call of their hearts and chose this military branch consciously. There is no other way for paratroopers: from the very first days of their service they must show willpower, bravery, stamina and be ready to risk and face the most difficult situations.
The soldiers of the 6th Company in the Argun Gorge faced exactly these challenges. They performed their combat duty with honour, rebuffing an enemy who had chosen to wage a criminal war against Russia.
We know that it was a fierce and unequal battle. The militants greatly outnumbered the personnel of the 6th Company. But they did not withdraw. All the soldiers sacrificed themselves and fought to the end, showing true heroism and courage.
Such valour and self-sacrifice for the sake of the Fatherland always was, is and will exemplify the true values of Russians, those values most treasured by the Russian people. This generation bridge and link of times will never be broken, and our heroes will always be an example to follow.
The Pskov paratroopers remained loyal to the vows of their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers who fought for their Motherland during various periods in Russia’s history. They are worthy successors of the generation that achieved the Great Victory, the 75th anniversary of which we will celebrate very soon.
We will never forget the heroic deeds of the soldiers who fought on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War, we will not forget those who perform their duties in hot spots today. We will remember and honour everyone – I want to stress this – everyone who defended Russia in the fight against international terrorism. Unfortunately, there were many such heroes in that period – a transitional, complicated period of our history – many. The 6th Company is among them. Young men, practically boys, but how they showed their true grit! Courage, heroism and loyalty to their oath.
You know, I often think about them, remember them. They were very young men who had only recently joined the army. And the country did not have a surge of patriotism that it once had, say, during the Great Patriotic War. And they were ushered straight into the fire! Amazing… They showed what a Russian soldier is capable of. All this, of course, we know from history but it is also rooted in the family.
I now address the family members of our heroes: we bow down before their parents and families! Glory to those officers who raised these soldiers and glory to their commanders, who were and forever remained by the side of their soldiers!
Eternal glory and eternal memory to the immortal 6th Company!

Ceremonial review of the 104th Guards Airborne Regiment of the Pskov Guards Air Assault Division.
As part of the commemorative events in honour of the paratroopers who heroically died 20 years ago, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief conducted a ceremonial review of the personnel of the 104th Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Guards Airborne Regiment of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division.
This division is the oldest of the Airborne Troops’ existing units. From 1999 to 2004 its personnel took part in the Second Chechen War. In 2000, the paratroopers of the 6th Company of the 104th Airborne Regiment displayed great heroism during a battle with armed rebel groups.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, sergeants and soldiers,
Today, here, on this parade square, which was so familiar to the 6th Company, we remember the brave paratroopers and salute their courage and feats.
They stood in the way of hundreds of militants and fought their last fight, their final battle as real heroes, remaining loyal to the best traditions of their brothers in arms, which are cherished by all generations of paratroopers.
The “airborne infantry” is always deployed to areas of great danger and challenges, where there is difficulty and risk, where powerful, swift and precise strikes are needed.
The history of the Airborne Troops is full of legendary examples of bravery, military training and unstoppable determination. The 104th Regiment, its soldiers and officers, wrote their own bright pages of military valour, displaying many times their highest professionalism and never sparing themselves, in training or in battle.
Our people are proud of you and believe that you will continue to resolutely defend the interests of Russia, protect its safety and the lives of our people. If necessary, you will continue to fight off adversaries the way it was done by your comrades, who will eternally remain your fellow soldiers, the paratroopers of the 6th Company.
Thank you for your service!
