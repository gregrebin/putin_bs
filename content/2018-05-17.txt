I will give you a few figures so that you can assess the scale of the work and the complexity of the tasks.
In 2018, the Defence Ministry released almost 1.5 trillion rubles for the state defence order. The amount is fairly significant, and these resources must be used as efficiently as possible.
Most of the contracts have already been concluded. Under them, the Armed Forces should receive over 160 units of aviation equipment, 10 surface combat ships and 14 space complexes. Arsenals of the general purpose forces should be replenished with 500 units of rocket and artillery weapons, tanks and armoured vehicles.
Please note that all contractors are personally responsible for strict observance of the deadlines for the production of weapons and equipment and the approved delivery schedule, so as to keep up the recently attained high rates of rearming the Army and the Navy.
As before, the focus is on the Aerospace Forces, and this applies to all its components, including aviation equipment, air defence, missile defence, and, of course, space systems, including those designed for communication, navigation and various types of reconnaissance.
New operational tactical aircraft Su-34, Su-35S, Su-30SM, and modern attack helicopters Mi-28, Mi-35M and Ka-52 will be supplied to aviation units.
Anti-aircraft missile units will receive the latest S-400 systems and Pantsir-S complexes.
I hereby request that the commander of the Aerospace Forces and heads of the leading defence industry enterprises in the aviation and aerospace spheres report in detail about progress and whether everything is going as scheduled.
Our priorities include continued development of advanced weapons systems, which must surpass the best foreign counterparts. We are expecting the design bureaus and research institutes to come up with breakthrough, outside-the-box and effective technical and engineering solutions, which, among other things, should reduce the time and the cost of creating and introducing new weapons. Of course, quality must also improve.
Let us get to work.

Beginning of meeting with President of Syria Bashar al-Assad
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am happy to see you in Russia. At the beginning of our meeting I would like to congratulate you on the start of the holy month of Ramadan.
I would also like to congratulate you on the major success of the Syrian Government Army in the struggle against terrorist units. Due to the efforts of your army recently, important steps have been made towards the further consolidation of the legitimate government. Terrorists have laid down arms in key areas of Syria, which made it possible to restore the country’s infrastructure, push them back and practically end their operations near the Syrian capital.
And, of course, after these military successes, additional conditions have certainly been created for the resumption of the full political process.
Much has been done during the Astana process. Much was accomplished at the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi. Now we can take further steps jointly with you. The next goal is, of course, economic recovery and humanitarian relief for the people who have found themselves in a predicament.

As you know, we are in contact with all sides of this complicated process, including the United Nations and Special Envoy of the Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura.
I would like to discuss with you all of these areas of our joint work. Welcome!
President of Syria Bashar al-Assad
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on the start of your new term in office. I believe that this election success proves the correctness of your policy both domestically and internationally since the Russian people see that the positions of your country on the global stage are becoming stronger thanks to your actions.
And I am happy to meet with you in Sochi again after our meeting several months ago. A great many positive changes have occurred in between these two meetings. First of all, the fight against terrorism. The terrorist-controlled areas have decreased significantly. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been able to return to their homes in recent weeks, millions more Syrians are on the way.
Stability is improving, and this opens doors for the political process that we launched some time ago. I always said, and I will repeat it now, that we always enthusiastically support the political process that should unfold alongside the fight against terrorism.
We know that it is not going to be easy as there are countries that do not want stability in Syria. However, we will firmly move on with you and with our other partners on the issue of the peace process to achieve peace. Today’s meeting gives us a good opportunity to work out our joint positions for the coming period regarding the negotiating process in Astana and Sochi.
Thank you again, I would like to especially thank the Russian Armed Forces, particularly the Aerospace Forces, which have played a very important role in fighting terrorism.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Meeting with Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov
Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov reported to the President on the state corporation’s performance in 2017.
May 17, 2018
20:00
Sochi
Meeting with Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chemezov, you are here to deliver the annual report on the corporation’s performance. You have my attention.
Rostec Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov
: We have prepared the traditional annual report. This report comes during an anniversary year, and so I would like to present it to you today. I would like to say that we have traditionally posted positive growth in economic indicators over the course of many years, almost every year of our existence.
In particular, revenues have grown by 26 percent compared to last year and currently stand at about 1.6 trillion rubles. It was 1.266 last year, but this year we are approaching 1.6 trillion. The EBITDA grew by 14 percent to reach 305 billion rubles. Net profit grew by 38 percent to 121 billion rubles.
We have practically fulfilled the state defence order; it stands at 98.2 percent complete. This number is also higher than it was last year. However, it is more important to stress the significant increase in the manufacture of non-defence products, which totalled 548 billion rubles. That is a 47 percent increase on 2016.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
With Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov.
Sergei Chemezov: The share of non-defence goods in 2017 was 29.1 percent, and 25.1 a year earlier. You set us the task of making non-defence goods 50 percent by 2025. We have set ourselves a more ambitious task of reaching that target of 50 percent non-defence goods by 2020.
Deliveries of military goods via Rosoboronexport are also growing despite various forms of sanctions pressure. They have reached 13.4 billion rubles, and this is just from Rosoboronexport.
Generally across Russia, taking into account other participants in defence industry cooperation, deliveries exceed 15 billion.
Vladimir Putin: What is the average wage?
Sergei Chemezov: The average wage has reached 47,000 rubles [a month] compared to 44,000 rubles last year.
Vladimir Putin: The year before last.
Sergei Chemezov: Yes, in the 2016 reporting year, and in 2017, it was 47,000 rubles.
The net profit margin was 7.6 percent, and output per worker grew by 11.2 percent amounting to 3.1 million rubles.
At a meeting with Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov.
Vladimir Putin: Has labour productivity grown?
Sergei Chemezov: Yes, it has. It was 2.8 million rubles in 2016, so it went up over 11 percent.
Among the most important events of the year, we can single out the successful launch of Russia’s first assembly and testing complex of gas turbine units for ships in Rybinsk. You were with us there when we launched it, and today this complex makes it possible to produce modern engines.
Vladimir Putin: For military ships?
Sergei Chemezov: Including for military ships. We did a great deal of work to prepare IT infrastructure for the World Cup. We are responsible for this.
Vladimir Putin: We should start mass production of this engine as soon as possible.
Sergei Chemezov: Yes, of course, surely.
Vladimir Putin: We need more engines.
Sergei Chemezov: Yes, we are working on this.
We were responsible for preparing IT infrastructure for the World Cup. As of today, we have formally completed this work.
Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov.
Perinatal centres were also opened. We built 15 centres overall. In 2017, we opened nine centres, two more in the first quarter of this year, and recently another centre was opened. We have to finish two more centres now. I think we will complete the construction of all centres before the end of May.
Also of note is the success of the Kortezh project to design a modern car, a good limousine, which I hope you liked.
Vladimir Putin: It is a good car.
Sergei Chemezov: Our corporation was also involved in its design. You know, I have had quite a number of phone calls from wealthy Russians who would like to purchase such a car.
Vladimir Putin: I wish them all the best in that. We have to set up quality manufacturing of jeeps and sedans cars, and begin mass production.
Sergei Chemezov: As a matter of fact, this is what we are currently working on.
Vladimir Putin: So that they are affordable not only for the wealthy but people of any income, including middle earners.
Sergei Chemezov: Yes.
Vladimir Putin: Good vans which could be used as family cars.
Sergei Chemezov: By the way, we have also designed a motorcycle that was supposed to escort your motorcade but, unfortunately, we did not manage to complete it.
Vladimir Putin: Will you keep working on it?
Sergei Chemezov: Yes, certainly. It has been through basically all the tests, there is not much left to be done. It is going to be a beautiful motorcycle, every bit as good as those made by western manufacturers.
Vladimir Putin: It should be better.
Sergei Chemezov: It will be. We will work to make it better.

With President of Syria Bashar al-Assad.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: During our today’s conversation, the President of Syria and I coordinated our joint efforts on fighting terrorism and terrorist organisations in the Syrian Arab Republic; we noted the major progress the Syrian army has made on this front, and concluded that, as of today, conditions are favourable for stepping up the political process.
On a related note, the President of Syria has made a decision to send his part of the delegation to form the Constitutional Committee that is supposed to work on the Constitution of Syria. Russia welcomes this decision and will support it in every way, taking into account the agreements reached during the Syrian National Dialogue Congress that took place several months ago in Sochi.
Along with stepping up the political process, we believe it is very important to take the necessary steps to rebuild Syria’s economy and to address long overdue and complicated humanitarian issues.

We are counting on support from the United Nations and all countries interested in resolving the Syrian crisis.
President of Syria Bashar al-Assad
(retranslated): I rate the results of today’s meeting very highly. It was very fruitful, in every sense of the word.
First, we assessed developments in Syria from a military standpoint. Things have been progressing well due to the steps taken on the counter-terrorism track. Consequently, thanks to the military success, we are succeeding in normalising the situation in the country, which opens the way for our many citizens to return to their homes.
I would like to thank President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the Russian Government for the humanitarian aid that Russia has always provided, at every stage of the Syrian crisis, to Syrian citizens who fled their homes in response to the actions of terrorists.
As to economic cooperation, we noted the recent growth of Russian investment, Russian companies’ investments in various areas of the Syrian economy, and also discussed possible steps to further encourage Russian companies to invest in our country and take part in the reconstruction process.
We assessed developments in the political process in recent months, by which I mean the outcome of the Syrian National Dialogue Congress and the latest rounds of talks in Astana, and we discussed steps that need to be taken to keep achieving progress in this area.
We focused on the issue of the Constitutional Committee that should be established following the results of the Syrian National Dialogue Congress. We expect to start the corresponding work with the UN. I have confirmed to President Putin today that Syria will send the list of its delegates to the Constitutional Committee to discuss amendments to the current Constitution. It will be done as soon as possible.
Vladimir Putin: We proceed from the assumption that in view of the significant victories and success achieved by the Syrian Army in its fight against terrorism, and the start of a more active phrase of the political process, foreign armed forces will be withdrawing from the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.
