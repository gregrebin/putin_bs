Question: Mr President, what are your plans for the day?
Vladimir Putin: Work: I have a couple of work meetings scheduled.
Question: Which percentage of votes will you consider a success for you?
Vladimir Putin: Any number that will give me the right to perform the duties of the President of the Russian Federation.
Question: Mr President, it must be difficult for you to make a choice: voting for yourself is awkward. Or are you able to overcome this awkwardness?
Vladimir Putin: Why? There is no need for me to overcome anything. I am confident in the correctness of the programme that I offer for the country’s development.

Vladimir Putin: Friends,
Thank you for coming here, to the heart of our nation’s capital, on this cold Moscow evening. Thank you very much for your support.
I would like to address those who are here in Moscow tonight, as well as supporters across our vast country. Thank you very much for this result.
Remark: We are your team!
Vladimir Putin: Exactly! We are a single team, I am a member of this team, and all those who cast their ballots today are members of our large national team. For me, this is an acknowledgement, to say the least, of what we have achieved in recent years despite the challenging conditions.
I see this as a sign of trust and hope, the hope of our people that we will work as hard, with the same responsibility and effectiveness as before. Thank you for being such a powerful, millions-strong team. We will definitely succeed.
Vladimir Putin addressed rally on Manezhnaya Square in Moscow.
My dear friends, it is critical that we preserve this sense of unity. It is essential that we reach out to those who voted for other candidates. We need this unity in order to move ahead. And in order to do so, we need to feel the support of every single member of our national community.
In our work, we will not be guided by any momentary considerations or vested interests. We will focus on the future of our great Motherland, and the future of our children. That way, we are poised for success. Thank you very much. Let us undertake a major, large-scale effort together in the name of Russia.
