President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
First, I would like to thank you for this lofty award. I do not think I have done anything to deserve this order; I rather take it as a sign of Serbia’s respect and love for Russia, for the Russian people. I would like to assure you that Russia would always consider Serbia as our closest ally and family, just as we have done in the past.
Thank you for this high award and accept my assurances that I will do everything for the consistent development of relations between Serbia and Russia in the interests of our peoples, so they would contribute to the development of a unified Europe and so that our cooperation would help resolve all the issues, all the conflicts we have inherited from the past.
Thank you very much.

Military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, friends, veterans, parade participants,
I am happy to be with you during these special, celebratory days.
Seventy years ago, Soviet soldiers and fighters in the Yugoslavian army liberated Belgrade from German fascist occupiers. The Belgrade operation, during which an enormous enemy grouping was destroyed, became an important step towards the great Victory.
Together, our peoples waged a long, persistent, bloody fight against the Nazis. Nearly all of Europe had been subdued by this brazen, barbaric force; however, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia demonstrated nationwide resistance against the aggressor.
The most important crushing blows against the enemy were made on the Eastern Front. Fighters from Yugoslavia’s guerrilla movement also contributed greatly to the Victory. They blocked dozens of Hitler’s divisions, preventing them from redeploying in Stalingrad and Kursk or being used in other crucial battles of World War II. The enemy was crushed.
We know that the Soviet Union played an exceptional, key role in the victory over Nazism, but we never divided the Victory into “ours” and “theirs,” and will always remember the help of our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition, participants in the resistance movement.
On this major anniversary of Belgrade’s liberation, we pay tribute and respect to all those who fought against Nazism on the fronts of World War II.
Friends, our fathers and grandfathers fought for a just cause and achieved heights of valour on all lines of this merciless war. Their bravery was limitless, their will and their comradery in battle were indestructible, and their fortitude was beyond measure. And now, here at the military parade, we share the same deep feelings: pride and heartfelt gratitude to our veterans, and a desire to be worthy of their heroism and glory.
Next May, together we will mark the 70th anniversary of the Great Victory. It was won at a high price and our common debt is to remember the lessons of World War II, to resist attempts to glorify Nazis and their collaborators, and to join forces in creating a climate of trust and mutual understanding in Europe.
I congratulate the residents of Belgrade and all Serbian citizens on this occasion with all my heart. I wish you success and prosperity!
Long live the brotherly nation of Serbia!

Beginning of meeting with Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I agree with you that trade and economic ties between Russia and Serbia are developing quite successfully. The statistics differ slightly, but our figures also show a significant growth in trade: according to our data, we’ve had an increase of about 17% in the first half of this year. In any event, this is a good rate.
Capital investments are growing as well. One of the companies that has attracted Russian investors, NIS, is probably the largest taxpayer in Serbia at this time. Russian investors have already invested $2 billion and are ready to invest another billion, while another of our companies, LUKOIL, has invested over $300 million.
We must diversify our contacts, our economic ties, including in manufacturing, high technologies (we have such options with you) and agriculture. I think that this is a very favourable moment for Serbia to occupy a good niche on the Russian market. Moreover, we could talk specifically about cooperation, and, if the investment process is organised by us, we could discuss possibilities for lending to Serbian agricultural enterprises.
I think that agricultural producers in some European nations would be happy to come to Serbia, invest funds together with Russian investors and produce goods with participation by Serbian producers, including for the Russian market.
Overall, we have much to discuss. I am very happy for the opportunity to discuss all the topics you suggested within the context of the events to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade, including possible supply to the Russian market of automotive products manufactured in Serbia in collaboration with Fiat company. Given our good relations with Italy and Fiat, as well as our very warm, allied, close relations with Serbia, I think we could agree on a certain quota for supplying these vehicles to the Russian market.
