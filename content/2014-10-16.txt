President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
First, I would like to thank you for this lofty award. I do not think I have done anything to deserve this order; I rather take it as a sign of Serbiaâ€™s respect and love for Russia, for the Russian people. I would like to assure you that Russia would always consider Serbia as our closest ally and family, just as we have done in the past.
Thank you for this high award and accept my assurances that I will do everything for the consistent development of relations between Serbia and Russia in the interests of our peoples, so they would contribute to the development of a unified Europe and so that our cooperation would help resolve all the issues, all the conflicts we have inherited from the past.
Thank you very much.
