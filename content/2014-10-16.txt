Military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, friends, veterans, parade participants,
I am happy to be with you during these special, celebratory days.
Seventy years ago, Soviet soldiers and fighters in the Yugoslavian army liberated Belgrade from German fascist occupiers. The Belgrade operation, during which an enormous enemy grouping was destroyed, became an important step towards the great Victory.
Together, our peoples waged a long, persistent, bloody fight against the Nazis. Nearly all of Europe had been subdued by this brazen, barbaric force; however, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia demonstrated nationwide resistance against the aggressor.
The most important crushing blows against the enemy were made on the Eastern Front. Fighters from Yugoslavia’s guerrilla movement also contributed greatly to the Victory. They blocked dozens of Hitler’s divisions, preventing them from redeploying in Stalingrad and Kursk or being used in other crucial battles of World War II. The enemy was crushed.
We know that the Soviet Union played an exceptional, key role in the victory over Nazism, but we never divided the Victory into “ours” and “theirs,” and will always remember the help of our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition, participants in the resistance movement.
On this major anniversary of Belgrade’s liberation, we pay tribute and respect to all those who fought against Nazism on the fronts of World War II.
Friends, our fathers and grandfathers fought for a just cause and achieved heights of valour on all lines of this merciless war. Their bravery was limitless, their will and their comradery in battle were indestructible, and their fortitude was beyond measure. And now, here at the military parade, we share the same deep feelings: pride and heartfelt gratitude to our veterans, and a desire to be worthy of their heroism and glory.
Next May, together we will mark the 70th anniversary of the Great Victory. It was won at a high price and our common debt is to remember the lessons of World War II, to resist attempts to glorify Nazis and their collaborators, and to join forces in creating a climate of trust and mutual understanding in Europe.
I congratulate the residents of Belgrade and all Serbian citizens on this occasion with all my heart. I wish you success and prosperity!
Long live the brotherly nation of Serbia!

A package of documents was signed following Russian-Serbian talks, including intergovernmental agreements on military technology cooperation, on mutual protection of classified information, and on readmission. The parties also signed a Protocol on the exchange of information on the customs cost of goods moved between Russia and Serbia, a Memorandum of Understanding on energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable sources, and an agreement on reconstruction of certain sections of railways and the supply of diesel trains.
Vladimir Putin and Aleksandar Vucic

Beginning of meeting with Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I agree with you that trade and economic ties between Russia and Serbia are developing quite successfully. The statistics differ slightly, but our figures also show a significant growth in trade: according to our data, we’ve had an increase of about 17% in the first half of this year. In any event, this is a good rate.
Capital investments are growing as well. One of the companies that has attracted Russian investors, NIS, is probably the largest taxpayer in Serbia at this time. Russian investors have already invested $2 billion and are ready to invest another billion, while another of our companies, LUKOIL, has invested over $300 million.
We must diversify our contacts, our economic ties, including in manufacturing, high technologies (we have such options with you) and agriculture. I think that this is a very favourable moment for Serbia to occupy a good niche on the Russian market. Moreover, we could talk specifically about cooperation, and, if the investment process is organised by us, we could discuss possibilities for lending to Serbian agricultural enterprises.
I think that agricultural producers in some European nations would be happy to come to Serbia, invest funds together with Russian investors and produce goods with participation by Serbian producers, including for the Russian market.
Overall, we have much to discuss. I am very happy for the opportunity to discuss all the topics you suggested within the context of the events to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade, including possible supply to the Russian market of automotive products manufactured in Serbia in collaboration with Fiat company. Given our good relations with Italy and Fiat, as well as our very warm, allied, close relations with Serbia, I think we could agree on a certain quota for supplying these vehicles to the Russian market.

The talks were preceded by an official welcoming ceremony and an introduction of the two countries’ delegation members.

President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic (retranslated): Welcome to Serbia, Mr President.
It is a great pleasure and honour to see you again in Belgrade, specifically because our relations are developing ever more successfully.
It has become popular to measure friendship in trade turnover. We see friendship differently. Today Serbia has no enemies; it only has friends, some bigger, some smaller. We see the Russian Federation as our big friend. We think the way our ancestors did, and we teach our children to think the way we do.
We share everything: not only our common Slavic background, language, faith, traditions and culture, but also the fact we have always been on the same side. Your support in maintaining the territorial integrity and independence of Serbia, specifically regarding Kosovo and Metohija, is invaluable for us. I know you maintain these principles, although you could have probably acted otherwise.
Serbia also sees Russia as its major partner and ally, and Serbia will never endanger its morals with some bad attitude to Russia. We cannot behave differently.
Our economic cooperation accompanies our friendship. In the first six months of the year, our trade turnover has grown. Exports from Serbia are lower than imports from Russia to Serbia, but that is mainly due to energy resources.
Today we will have an opportunity to discuss the issues that we are mainly responsible for in the energy complex; we will see how the debt issue may be resolved and how Russia can help us, specifically in the petrochemical industry.
What I personally find most important is agriculture. I believe that with the development of agriculture in Serbia Russia would have a reliable supply of such produce.
One again, welcome to Serbia, where both the authorities and the people are always happy to see you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you for your invitation to visit Serbia and Belgrade during the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade from Nazi occupation. We fought together for the right cause. We had a lot in common in the past, and I hope — I am sure we have a good common future.
You mentioned Russia’s position regarding Kosovo. Russia has taken a principled stance based not only on our friendship and proximity, but also on international law and justice. This is a principled position and it cannot be adjusted in any way. We have always supported Serbia and will continue to do so. Russia does not deal in friendship.
As for our trade and economic ties, there really is a tendency for growth, although the current conditions are such that this growth could have been greater, and I fully agree with you here.
I hope that in the course of our contacts with you, Mr President, and with the Prime Minister of Serbia, we will manage to find extra reserves for the development of our trade and economic ties.
Thank you very much.

Press statement following Russian-Serbian talks. With Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
First, I would like to thank Mr President and Mr Prime Minister for the invitation.
I would like to say that our talks took place in a very constructive and business-like atmosphere. The main result is that we have confirmed our mutual intent to develop cooperation between Serbia and Russia in various areas. We have noted that our relations are developing quite well, if not to say very well. Against the backdrop of the current problems in the global economy, an annual growth of over 16 percent is a very good index.
Russia’s investment in Serbia’s economy is also growing. Currently it has reached about $3 billion. Our leading companies are operating steadily. One of the leaders of our cooperation – NIS – is picking up speed. Russian participants have already invested $2 billion and are ready to invest another $1 billion.
Only recently, when the Russian company was joining NIS it was a losing business. Today, it is successfully operating and is a major source of budget revenue in Serbia, accounting for 14 percent of overall budget revenue. Our other companies, like LUKOIL, have already invested $300–400 million and are ready to develop their cooperation.
We cooperate in many other areas as well, such as energy, machine building, high technologies, and, of course, agriculture. Today Serbia supplies about $130–150 million worth of agricultural produce to Russia. If we implement the agreements we have reached today in the course of our negotiations, in a very short period of time this amount can grow to $500 million.
The Serbian economy benefits from this as well in terms of additional jobs and taxes collected at all levels of the budget system. This is also a positive factor for Russia because of the vacant positions that have appeared after Russia imposed limitations on the delivery of agricultural produce from countries that joined or initiated sanctions against it. In other words, this could turn out to be a blessing in disguise. I believe this is a good chance for producers in those countries that wish to develop relations with the Russian Federation.
We naturally discussed political issues as well. As you may know, we advocate a comprehensive resolution of the Kosovo issue on the basis of the UN Security Council Resolution 1244, and we have always adhered to this position and intend to do so in future.
Our political relations are also very stable. We expect that after Belgrade assumes Presidency of the OSCE in 2015, we will be able to continue our constructive work with this organisation as well, with the support in this case of our Serbian friends.
We will be very happy to see the Serbian leadership, the President of Serbia in Moscow on May 9 next year for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of Victory over Nazism.
I am very happy and grateful to the Serbian leadership for the invitation to visit Belgrade during the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of this country from Nazi occupation. This is a page in our common glorious history that unites us and creates a good foundation for the further development of our relations.
Thank you.
Question: Mr President, you have just said that Russian investment in the Serbian economy has reached $3 billion. Considering the situation that is developing on the investment market and given that a number of countries are trying to make Russia’s existence on this market difficult, how do you see the prospects for Russian-Serbian investment cooperation? Maybe you discussed some specific future projects today. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Those who tried to make our economic life difficult are making it difficult for themselves as well. We know that the losses experienced by agricultural producers in those countries of Europe that imposed sanctions against Russia (and we were forced to reciprocate by limiting supply of agricultural produce) run into billions of euros. We would not like to carry on this way, but this is what we have at this point. As I have said, for countries like Serbia this is a favourable time to occupy its proper spot on our market.
In this connection, we are ready – this is something we discussed with the Prime Minister – to invest into the development of Serbian agriculture together with Russian producers and, by the way, with those producers in Western Europe who would like to operate in Serbia to ship their produce to the Russian market. We have very good relations with many producers, with major European companies and this is where I see opportunities for joint work.
As for other investment, it is also mutually beneficial, and here I am referring not only to energy, important as it is, but also to machine building and infrastructure development. I already mentioned that Russia has allocated an $800 million loan to Serbia for the development of its railway network. The first stage is being prepared for implementation – worth $104 or $105 million.
We have said today that we are ready to carry on this work, but generally we are talking here not only about state investment but private investment as well. I believe that in the next three years it can be at least doubled to reach $6 or even around $10 billion.
Question: Do you expect a gas crisis in Europe this winter? And in this context, what are the prospects for the implementation of the South Stream project?
Vladimir Putin: The South Stream project cannot be implemented unilaterally. This is just like love: it can only be happy if there are two people in this wonderful process and both want to develop their relations. Same here: we cannot unilaterally build a pipeline system worth billions of dollars if our partners are still considering whether they need to implement this project or not.
Incidentally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there have been extensive discussions in connection with and during the construction of the North Stream – the pipeline system along the bottom of the Baltic Sea. Now that it is built, everyone is happy and they all thank those who initiated the project, who built it and who organised the work because the project turned out to be very timely.
The same is true of the South Stream. I am certain that this project is profitable for European consumers because it significantly reduces transit risks.
The delays in the construction of the South Stream only have to do with political considerations and in this case, quite obviously, politics are damaging the economy. To an extent, this is reducing the competitive advantages of the European economy compared to those of other regions of the world.
As for possible crises, whether we expect them or not, we would not like to see any critical situations developing in autumn and winter. I can assure you that there will be no crises through the fault of the Russian participants in energy cooperation in Europe. Russia has always been a reliable supplier; we have sufficient resources to provide for our own needs and for the growing needs of our consumers in Europe or Asia.
However, there are significant transit risks, and if we see that our Ukrainian partners begin unsanctioned siphoning of our gas from the export pipeline system, the way they did, say, in 2008, we will reduce our shipments by that very amount, just as we did in 2008.
However, I really do hope this does not happen, I hope that shortly – I am having meetings in Italy today on this issue as well, our partners are in close contact, both European and Ukrainian ones – I hope we manage to reach agreement on all matters and put an end to all disputes.
