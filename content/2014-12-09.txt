At the official reception on Heroes of the Fatherland Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
I sincerely congratulate you on the Heroes of the Fatherland Day!
Today, here at the Kremlin’s St George Hall, which holds the glorious memory of the victorious Russian army, we honour those who commendably continue these great traditions.
The Heroes of the Soviet Union, the Heroes of Russia, the holders of the Order of Glory and Order of St George – you all have made a top-level contribution to strengthening our nation’s security. You have carried out feats on the battlefield and showed valour in peacetime, once again proving how significant the role of each person is in serving our Fatherland, the devotion to the duty to one’s land, one’s people, the traditions that our forefathers passed onto us, readiness to take real action when it is needed in the interests of the Fatherland. Your daring and courage embrave the others and strengthen the belief in the endless power of the human spirit. We are proud of you.
I welcome the veterans of the Great Patriotic War who are in this hall today. Your generation will always be an example of honest, selfless service to Russia, of bravery and endurance that make any force powerless. I imagine there are few nations in the world where these qualities are the foundation of the national character, where heroism in the name of honour and freedom of one’s Fatherland is set on the highest, moral pedestal.
The Heroes of the Fatherland Day is especially important in Russia. We pay tribute to those who protected the sacred right for people to live of their own free will and according to their own laws in earlier years and times. And we look up to you.
Dear Heroes of our nation,
It is you to whom I would like to address my words of the most sincere and profound gratitude. I once again congratulate you on this holiday. I wish you good health and happiness. And, of course, my warmest wishes to your families and loved ones, those who always support you and love you.
Allow me to propose a toast to mark today’s holiday. To the heroes, to these brave, strong people! To our people! To the great Russia!

Meeting with Government members
Vladimir Putin held a regular meeting with Government members.

The Kremlin, Moscow
6 of 6
Meeting with Government members.
The discussion focussed on the practical implementation of the goals stated in the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly.
Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev explained the causes behind price rises. Mr Ulyukayev said that consumer prices for foodstuffs as of December 1 were up 13.1 percent compared to last year. This, he said, is due in part to imbalances on the goods markets, including because of restrictions on imports of a number of foodstuffs. He said that this situation with foodstuffs prices could continue until the end of the first quarter next year. Starting in the second quarter of 2015, growth in foodstuffs prices is expected to slow down as producers adapt to the new situation and import supplies become more diversified.
Rising petrol prices on the domestic market, which has seen an increase of 9.4 percent this year, are due to a reduction in physical volumes of petrol supplies, Mr Ulyukayev said. The rise in costs of medicines is slightly higher than the consumer price index and comes to 11.6 percent.
Overall, in Mr Ulyukayev’s view, there are good prospects for bucking the price rise trend on the foodstuffs market and on markets for other important consumer goods. 
Mr Putin stressed the point that the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service and other oversight agencies, with assistance from the Economic Development Ministry, must constantly study this matter so as to ensure that market actors do not take action for which there are no objective justifications.
Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova spoke about the work underway to raise medical personnel’s qualifications in preparation for the introduction in 2016 of compulsory accreditation of medical sector workers.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today we will work in two formats: first the discussion will be held by those present and later we will be joined by our colleagues from companies with state participation.
Both in the first and the second case, we will talk about implementing the Address [to the Federal Assembly]. I would like to thank the Government, the Government leadership for the prompt response to the Presidential Address. I know that the Prime Minister has already prepared instructions to be issued on this subject. Thank you very much.
There are some points we will need to talk about in this format, and we will do this now, but first we should discuss a few urgent issues.
I’d like to start by asking Mr Ulyukayev, the Minister of Economic Development, to say a few words about the consumer inflation issue. There are obviously some objective circumstances here, the situation with imports and the change in our currency’s exchange rate due to the drop in global energy prices. These are objective causes. Another objective cause is the restrictions that we introduced on imports of foodstuffs. We see this as a temporary problem because the current price situation is linked to the costs our companies are bearing and the need to increase production. This will ultimately benefit our agriculture sector and indeed our entire country.
But some of what we see is cause for question. Prices for petroleum products rose by 10 percent as of December 1, even though global oil prices have dropped by 35 percent. The questions do not end here. The whole situation would not be such cause for question if it were not for the fact that most of the price growth is in the retail segment, while wholesale prices are dropping. What are we to make of this? Where is the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service? I’d like to hear a few words on these issues.

Meeting on improving the efficiency of state companies

Meeting on improving the efficiency of state companies.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, colleagues.
We have already begun to discuss several issues with Government members, and we have invited you here to talk about them today as well. I am referring to a certain part of the Address, and now I will say a few more words about this in detail.
First of all, I am talking about specific steps to increase the efficiency of state corporations and companies with state participation, where the state owns 50 percent or more of the shares.
We have 52 such companies. They hold leading positions in key sectors of the economy: in infrastructure, energy and the military industrial complex; they have close economic and cooperative ties with many companies across the country.
In this regard, I will stress again: state companies should prioritise placing orders with Russian organisations, first and foremost, with small and midsize businesses. It is of course necessary to buy abroad, but we must import only unique equipment and technologies without which we cannot develop, or will develop less effectively, worse than we would like. We are talking first and foremost about technologies and equipment that do not have analogues in Russia.
Naturally, domestic suppliers’ offers need to be competitive, both in quality and in price, since these expenditures are laid into the cost of production for state companies and, as we all understand, affect your profitability.
I will remind you that the Address set the objective to lower state companies’ operating costs by no less than 2–3 percent annually. Fulfilling this objective should become one of the key indicators of the company executives’ efficacy and should form the basis for their remuneration.
Overall, it is necessary to analyse state corporations’ business models, to clear their balance sheets and create a straightforward plan for disposing of their non-core assets; we must also update long-term development programmes and conduct audits. These instructions are in place. I expect to hear today about how they are being carried out.
At the same time, I would like to note that the development and implementation of a corporate strategy is systemic, but nevertheless internal work. However, taking into account the status of state-owned companies, I feel it is necessary for the Government to prepare a list of interrelated strategic documents that will be required for organisations with state participation.
Furthermore, as I said in the Address, it is imperative to bring order to state companies’ finances. This is fundamentally important for corporations with a wide network of subsidiaries and affiliates, where unfortunately, the holding company often does not see financial resolutions at the local level, which can lead to a diffusion of resources, low returns on investment, and losses.
It is necessary to monitor the flow of funds and financial risks in both the holding company and its subsidiaries, while all operations of a specific state-owned company should be conducted through a single financial settlements centre. This approach allows for optimising state companies’ money flows, making their management more efficient. As you recall, corresponding instructions were given to the Government. Starting next July, unified treasuries should start operating. And today, I would like to hear how this work is going, as well as work to transfer state companies’ funds to Russia’s core banks.
And the last issue I would like to touch on concerns discipline in paying dividends. It is clear that the state’s participation in state companies’ capital provides significant advantages, such as strong support in carrying out complex projects and the opportunity to strengthen positions in the foreign markets. At the same time, the government as the major shareholder certainly has the right to expect corresponding returns.
I want to remind you that we agreed on the general principle as regards payment of dividends to the state: no less than 25% of net profits. However, based on the results of the past two years, this requirement is met by just over half of state-owned companies, and some even managed to get individual Government resolutions allowing them not to pay dividends or significantly reduce their size.
It is clear that all of us here are grown-up, experienced people, and it is clear that the arguments are always solid and based on the need for capital investments. Let’s agree that if decisions are made, they need to be fulfilled. And if they are not fulfilled, then new decisions are needed, reasonable and systemic, not spotty ones, or ones in favour of individual enterprises that get close to the high offices.
With this in mind, let’s begin today’s meeting.

Russian Geographical Society's award presentation

Russian Geographical Society's award presentation ceremony.
Konstantin Bogdanov is the leader and organiser of the Lefort expedition. On May 4, 2013 participants in this project found Lefort, a battleship of the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet. The location where the ship sank had remained unknown for one and a half centuries, and the catastrophe’s causes had been misunderstood. The tragedy of the ship and its 826 passengers ranks ninth in the list of the biggest wrecks in history that took place in peacetime. Studies involving dozens of dives to a depth of 70 metres helped identify the causes of the ship’s sinking and to recreate the course of events. A virtual museum with photo and video materials was created on the basis of the expedition’s findings.
Around 350 projects competed for the Russian Geographical Society’s awards, which were presented in seven categories: Expedition and Travel, Geographical Research, Youth Projects, Russia’s Natural and Cultural Heritage, Media Projects, Russian Geographical Society’s Person of the Year, and Best Foreign Project about Russia.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, good afternoon,
You know, at the very beginning, when the host was introducing today’s event, I was looking at the screen, watching how various expeditions were organised in the previous years, long ago, and how this is done today. And I thought that this is actually a very difficult and sometimes dangerous work. This is a truly hard work that requires enormous effort and sometimes is a risk to life.
But nevertheless, people do travel, fly, sail, climb the mountains and dive underwater. Why? Because, first of all, they believe that what they do is very necessary. I want to address all of you and say that this is true, and I want to thank you very much.
And second, these are people who are very much dedicated to what they do; they give a part of themselves to this work, devote a significant part of their lives to the cause they have chosen to serve. And only when these two parts – a personal inner conviction that what you do is important and right, and readiness to devote yourself to this work – blend together, only then do you get results.
Of course, behind any result, there is usually not just one person, but an entire team, at least in the work that we are looking at today – it’s not just one person. Even if something is then given his or her name, there is usually an entire team behind it, a whole a group of likeminded people. So in presenting the awards to specific people today – it is no accident that they themselves spoke about it – we are honouring the entire group of people who stood behind the results achieved in these expeditions.
Today, we are attending a very pleasant event. We are giving rise to another tradition of the Russian Geographical Society – the presentation of awards. Here, our wonderful and widely respected cosmonaut said that the Russian Geographical Society once went to oblivion, but then was back to life again. Let’s think it took a lengthy nap and then once again returned to us, like a Sleeping Beauty, and now it brings us joy, inspiring new achievements.
When we talk about Person of the Year, it means that the team and its leader are recognised for having done something special, something important and very interesting. Let’s look at who this is and what their work is about.
The experts have decided to bestow the Person of the Year of the Russian Geographical Society prize to Konstantin Bogdanov, for discovering and exploring the Lefort ship. The location of its wreck and the causes were a mystery for nearly 150 years, but our laureate, together with his colleagues and friends, carried out this enormous work.
But, as far as I know, this is not the only work carried out by this team. They are engaged in a huge project to restore the names of heroes in the Great Patriotic War and World War I. They have an entire programme that is called A Bow to the Ships of the Great Victory. They are locating the wreck sites of submarines and battleships perished in World War I and World War II, in the Great Patriotic War and, as I already said, are restoring the names of heroes.
This is extremely important work; it is always important, and will be especially important over the centuries. But on the eve of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, this is especially important.
Thank you very much. I wish you new successes.
