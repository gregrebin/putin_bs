At the official reception on Heroes of the Fatherland Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
I sincerely congratulate you on the Heroes of the Fatherland Day!
Today, here at the Kremlin’s St George Hall, which holds the glorious memory of the victorious Russian army, we honour those who commendably continue these great traditions.
The Heroes of the Soviet Union, the Heroes of Russia, the holders of the Order of Glory and Order of St George – you all have made a top-level contribution to strengthening our nation’s security. You have carried out feats on the battlefield and showed valour in peacetime, once again proving how significant the role of each person is in serving our Fatherland, the devotion to the duty to one’s land, one’s people, the traditions that our forefathers passed onto us, readiness to take real action when it is needed in the interests of the Fatherland. Your daring and courage embrave the others and strengthen the belief in the endless power of the human spirit. We are proud of you.
I welcome the veterans of the Great Patriotic War who are in this hall today. Your generation will always be an example of honest, selfless service to Russia, of bravery and endurance that make any force powerless. I imagine there are few nations in the world where these qualities are the foundation of the national character, where heroism in the name of honour and freedom of one’s Fatherland is set on the highest, moral pedestal.
The Heroes of the Fatherland Day is especially important in Russia. We pay tribute to those who protected the sacred right for people to live of their own free will and according to their own laws in earlier years and times. And we look up to you.
Dear Heroes of our nation,
It is you to whom I would like to address my words of the most sincere and profound gratitude. I once again congratulate you on this holiday. I wish you good health and happiness. And, of course, my warmest wishes to your families and loved ones, those who always support you and love you.
Allow me to propose a toast to mark today’s holiday. To the heroes, to these brave, strong people! To our people! To the great Russia!
