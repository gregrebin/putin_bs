Barvikha, Moscow Region
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Colleagues, we are all busy preparing for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Your meeting, this meeting of secretaries of the SCO member states’ security councils, is part of this work.
I am sure that you have examined the most important current issues concerning security in our countries, and not just in our countries but in the different regions in which the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation works. There are a good many issues on the agenda. You are all very familiar with the problems and challenges our countries face. They include fighting crime, including drug-related crimes and offences, ensuring regional security in the context of problems affecting a number of neighbouring states, problems that also create tension in our own countries too, and a large number of other issues. Of course, the economic crisis also affects that general security situation, and also has to be taken into consideration as one of the factors that has a direct impact on security.
I am sure that you have discussed all of these different issues, and we will make use of the conclusions from these consultations at the SCO summit. I hope we will be able to go through this list of issues during today’s meeting too.
Thank you.
