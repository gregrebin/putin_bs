President of Russia: Hello Igor Valentinovich!
The Eurasian Development Bank has already been established for more than two and a half years ago and its main purpose is financing large investment projects. Despite the complexities of the current global financial situation, I believe that the bank is nevertheless one hundred percent able to perform the tasks it has been assigned.
I would like you to tell us what projects have been implemented and what is in the pipeline.
chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Development Bank Igor Finogenov: Indeed, two years have passed since the Bank was created and during these years we have implemented and considered a number of major projects. One of these projects has been completed – you opened the chromite mine on September 22. This is an important and ambitious project.
Dmitry Medvedev: This is our state project and we opened it in Kazakhstan …
Igor Finogenov: Yes, in Kazakhstan, in Aktyubinsk. We are implementing another major project in Kazakhstan, that of reconstructing the Ekibastuz State District Power Station. This is an important major integration project because the electricity produced at this plant is delivered to both Kazakhstan and Russia.
We have several other projects in the nuclear sector and in infrastructure. In particular, we are implementing a project to build a new terminal in the port of Ust-Luga. We have a portfolio of projects in the pipeline that are worth four billion dollars.
We are moving forward without pausing and we have the opportunity to vigorously pursue our work.
Dmitry Medvedev: Good. Then it is necessary that you nevertheless pay attention to all the provisions included in the Bank's charter, the tasks that the public authorities have set you and, of course, monitor the situation on the financial markets.
At the same time, it is very important for us that major investment projects do not stop, but rather develop. Investment institutions such as yours are another guarantee that they will be implemented. Keep working.
