Mr Medvedev and Mr Arculli specifically discussed the establishment of an international financial centre in Moscow. The President noted that Hong Kong’s experience could be useful for Russia and that cooperation with Hong Kong offers additional opportunities for expanding ties with China, and establishes a platform too for operating in the Asia-Pacific region.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA DONALD TSANG: (retranslated): Mr President, it is a great honour to welcome you here to Hong Kong. I remember well our first meeting at the APEC summit two years ago in Singapore. Later, you invited me to visit Moscow, where we had fruitful talks.
Let me say again that we are very happy to see you in Hong Kong.
Over the two years since our first meeting bilateral relations between Hong Kong and Russia have come a long way. Our bilateral trade increased by 63 percent over the last year, and passenger turnover was up by 16 percent. I am sure that this is only the beginning.
I hope that our relations will continue to deepen and expand in trade, culture, sports, and many other areas.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Tsang, as I promised, I have come to Hong Kong. I think that this will give a substantial boost to the level of cooperation between Hong Kong and the Russian Federation.
I note that the ties between Hong Kong and Russia’s regions, and between our economies in general, strengthened considerably following your visit to Moscow.
You mentioned some of the figures reflecting the present level of our cooperation. They are good results, but it is too early to sit back yet, all the more so as we have huge opportunities for developing our economic ties and bolstering our humanitarian cooperation.
It is my hope, and that of the Russian delegation, that this first visit by a Russian President to Hong Kong will do much to advance our cooperation.
