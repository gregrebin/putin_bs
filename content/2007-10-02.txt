President Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank all of you for taking part in today’s work. I would just like to say a few concluding remarks.
The Sochi Olympics project is ambitious, of course, but we are not carrying it out in order to satisfy some ambition or other. We need this project in order to develop our country and develop one of its most important regions – southern Russia.
Millions of our people go abroad on holiday even though we offer wonderful possibilities at home. Why do they go abroad? Why do our citizens prefer to vacation in other countries? Because the services offered there are better and sometimes cheaper.
Unfortunately, our infrastructure remains underdeveloped in practically all the regions. We now have a unique chance to concentrate administrative, financial and political resources on making a breakthrough in national infrastructure development, in this particular case, in southern Russia.
This is also an excellent opportunity and an excellent impulse for developing sport and physical culture. Looking at what we have been talking about today – schools, universities, development of mass sport – this is all extremely important for Russia’s citizens. But the quality of the results achieved will depend on the extent to which we succeed in bringing together our combined efforts.
I hope very much that we will succeed in uniting our efforts and achieve the results that the people of Russia hope to see from us.
Thank you very much for our work together.
