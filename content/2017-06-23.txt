Address to Russian school leavers.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear school leavers,
This is a special day for you today. You are saying goodbye to your school, to your wonderful, absorbing and unforgettable school life; you are parting with your teachers, who have introduced you to the world of knowledge, taught you to work and be diligent, and sought to bring you up as honest and decent people.
Years will pass and you will fully appreciate how much of what is needed, useful and good you have been given by the school and your instructors.
Today, you are looking to the future, to a new, adult life. Some of you have already decided on your short-term plans, while others are still thinking and reflecting on this. Try, dare, and make decisions! Donâ€™t be afraid of you ambitions and of setting super-tasks for yourselves. Try to achieve what possibly no one has ever done.
You are the hope of our country, our Homeland. Russia needs your energy and your talents.
Good luck to you!
Be successful and happy!
