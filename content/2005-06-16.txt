The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: I would like to begin our meeting by noting that relations between our countries are continuing to develop all the time. Trade between our countries is increasing and political contacts are continuing, at the highest level and through our Foreign Ministries, our governments in general and the work of the Intergovernmental Commission. The number of Russian tourists visiting your country is also growing.
Juan Carlos I: Yes, there are more and more of them every year. Spanish tourists are also visiting Russia in ever-greater numbers.
Vladimir Putin: This is true.
Your Majesty, your visit is also a good sign as it shows the level of relations between our countries.
Juan Carlos I: Allow me to thank you for personally receiving me here. I would also like to pass on to you greetings from the Spanish government and also from all the members of the royal family, from my wife, Queen Sophia, from Crown Prince Felipe and from my daughters. I also want to say that we are awaiting your official visit to Spain. The invitation has already been made. This is a continuation of the friendly contacts that were established during your first visit to our country.
Vladimir Putin: I remember this invitation. Thank you for this and we shall certainly make this visit.
Our Foreign Ministry is working on finding a date for the visit that suits both you and the Spanish government and the Russian side. We will reach a final decision on this question very soon.
Thank you very much.
