Speech at the event to mark the 1030th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Holiness,
Participants and guests of the celebrations marking the 1030th anniversary of the Baptism of Russia,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Baptism of Rus was a major turning point in our history, an event accelerating civilization, transforming spiritual strength. It determined Russiaâ€™s further centuries-long path and influenced global development.
We traditionally celebrate this event in a special way, with deep reverence for our ancestors who showed wisdom and great foresight by commencing the era to which we all belong today.
The Baptism of Rus is inextricably linked with the name of the Holy Prince Vladimir Equal to the Apostles, who made this decisive choice and became the conductor of faith. He was the one who first saw it as moral support, beauty, the light of truth and virtue, and a basis for renewal, for greater unity and community of peoples living in ancient Rus.
A warrior who has gone through fierce battles and trials, Vladimir became an enlightener, a creator. Under his leadership, churches and monasteries, cities, schools and libraries were built.
Baptism was the starting point for the development of Russian statehood, the true spiritual birth of our ancestors, the definition of their identity, the heyday of national culture and education, as well as the development of multifaceted ties with other countries.
