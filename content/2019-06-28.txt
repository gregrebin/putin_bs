Conversation with President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am very glad to see you again.
Neighbourly relations between Russia and the Republic of Korea, which we consider to be one of our key partners in Asia, are developing properly. Next year we will mark 30 years of diplomatic relations between our countries.
Trade is growing, last year by 29 percent and in the first months of this year by another 39 percent. One hundred and fifty South Korean companies work in Russia, and current investment totals $2.7 billion.
Mr President, we could discuss both these issues and certainly those that are of mutual interest. I mean the developments in the region as a whole and on the Korean Peninsula, especially because, as you know, I recently met with the leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I would like to share my impressions of that meeting with you and discuss the situation in general.
President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in
 (retranslated): I am very glad to see you again after our meeting in Singapore in November last year. This is our fifth meeting. The more often we meet, the better our relations become, and I am happy about this.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your letter of condolences to the families of those who died or were injured in the tragic boat wreck in Hungary. I would also like to express my deep condolences over the sudden death of Vadim Kabayev, an experienced diplomat and counsellor of the Russian Embassy in the Republic of Korea.
I would like to note that our bilateral relations are making steady progress in various fields. I am especially satisfied that our high-level contacts have increased. I would like to mention that Secretary of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev visited Korea in April and South Korea’s National Assembly Speaker Moon Hee-sang visited Russia in May. Recently, this month Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha was in Russia.

Conversation with President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Please accept my heartfelt greetings.
Our previous meeting took place in July 2018 in Johannesburg. Today I want to congratulate you once again on the victory of your party, African National Congress, in the general election in May and you personally on re-election as president. I wish you good luck and every success.
We assign high priority to developing our multidimensional relations with South Africa. Specific steps to promote our bilateral overarching strategic partnership were formalised in the joint statement we adopted last year in Johannesburg.
Our close cooperation at the international arena will continue. I hope that we will further promote everything that has been achieved over the previous years, including with your participation.
We welcome South Africa’s efforts as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2019 and 2020 and highly appreciate the results of South Africa’s presidency in BRICS in 2018. This November, we are to work together in Brazil within the framework of BRICS and next summer the five countries’ meeting will take place in Russia.
Mr President, we hope to see you in Sochi at the first Russia–Africa summit in October and just before the summit, on October 23, there will be a major economic forum. With due regard to our special, good-hearted and warm allied relationship, we rely on your assistance, Mr President, in preparing for this summit.
President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa
: Thank you very much, President Putin. I want to welcome this opportunity to meet with you once again. It is always a great pleasure to have discussions and consultations with yourselves.
I’d like to start by thanking you for the congratulatory message that you sent, but especially the envoy that you sent to represent you at the inauguration.
I would like to reaffirm the importance that I personally attach, as well as South Africa attaches, to the relationship that we have with your country. This partnership builds on the bonds of friendship that were forged many many years ago during our period of struggle, when the Soviet Union supported us very actively and practically. A support that we continue to enjoy with the Russian Federation under your leadership. We really appreciate that.
I also would like to appreciate the cooperation that we enjoy and have as members of BRICS. You continue to support the various efforts that we make in BRICS and indeed, in a number of other international fora. Our continued cooperation, not only at the UN, the UN Security Council and many other international fora is something that strengthens us and we really appreciate that.
We look forward to coming to Sochi, and we thank you for your invitation. I am hoping that our participation there will continue to deepen and advance our relationship. And I know that I still have an outstanding visit to Russia, and I would like to take that invitation up. We will be discussing the dates when that should best happen. So it’s something that we have at the top of our mind because we look forward to that opportunity to further deepen relations between our two countries on a number of issues, social, economic, cultural, technological, and in many other ways.
Our relationship with the Russian Federation is a very special one, and we thank you for being able to meet us.

With President of France Emmanuel Macron.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very pleased to use our stay in Osaka to talk about our bilateral relations.
I would like to emphasise once again that France is one of our main foreign partners. We have gained much experience in constructive cooperation in many areas. Of course, we are aware of the problems and we discuss them. In fact, we were fairly active even during our working lunch in discussing some international issues that are definitely of mutual interest. And we can talk about all these issues in a calm atmosphere. I am very grateful that you have found the time for this meeting. Thank you.
President of France Emmanuel Macron
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President, dear Vladimir.
I am happy that we have another opportunity to exchange opinions, primarily on our bilateral agenda, which has received new impetus after your visit to Versailles and my visit to St Petersburg.
There are matters and issues on which we must make progress in the next few weeks. I hope we will discuss them. Our foreign and defence ministers will have an important meeting in the “two-plus-two” format in a few weeks.
This is also a chance to discuss regional issues. Our countries are members of the UN Security Council. I believe it is important to discuss, as we already have, the developments in Ukraine, which we are monitoring within the Minsk process. A meeting is scheduled to take place in July between political advisors within the Normandy format. Of course, today we will also touch on developments in Iran and in Syria. We have a lot of work to do together.
I know that cooperation between our countries, members of the UN Security Council, is of the utmost importance in today’s global situation. And I know that liberal democracies still have a lot to do and add in this modern, unpredictable world. This is not the only development model, but a model that is still alive and has effect. I believe that a dialogue between liberal democracies and the countries that consider themselves among them will allow us to build and achieve many things. This is why I believe our discussion will be productive.
Vladimir Putin: We will have time for a discussion. There is always potential; nothing disappears completely, nothing dies; one form turns into another, and everything is constantly developing.
