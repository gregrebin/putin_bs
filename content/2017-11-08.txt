Working meeting with Head of Ingushetia Yunus-Bek Yevkurov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Yevkurov.
Let us begin with the relocation of people from Chechnya, as well as about the programme to relocate families from landslide-prone areas. And after that we will talk about other subjects.
Head of Ingushetia Yunus-Bek Yevkurov
: Mr President, we are completing these two programmes with your support. These problems created serious tension in society. We had the problem with internally displaced persons for over 20 years, and the problem of the landslide-prone areas emerged in the 1960s.
We will complete both programmes this year. By the end of this month, we will relocate nearly 800 families or over 8,000 people. By late December, we will relocate between 7,500 and 8,000 people from landslide-prone areas. It is a good programme, and we have implemented it successfully.
This year we expect our industrial production index to reach 109 percent. The reasons for this are a radiator plant and a textile factory we have opened, as well as a polymer pipe plant. Upon your instructions, Rostec will assume responsibility for the energy-saving lamp plant, which will start working at the end of this month as well.
Agricultural production index is estimated to reach 107 or 108 percent. The reason for this is our orchards, one of the best in the country. By the end of 2019, the area planted with orchards will reach 1,100 hectares, and we will also have 60,000 refrigerating facilities.
Greenhouse farms built on an area of 10 hectares will produce the first harvest of some 9,000 tonnes next April. In 2019, the greenhouse area will be increased by 20 hectares, that is, to 30 hectares, and this is only in one region.
Vladimir Putin: Very good.
Yunus-Bek Yevkurov: During a meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission held in Saudi Arabia, we have reached an agreement with Saudi investors on the export of our agricultural products. We started working with them last year, and we will boost our cooperation in 2017 and 2018.
Vladimir Putin: What do you sell?
Yunus-Bek Yevkurov: We can market up to 20,000 tonnes of apples, and we have delivered 48 tonnes of honey, although our annual capacity is up to 300 tonnes of honey. We can also deliver large volumes of water, as well as greenhouse vegetables. I think we can deliver between 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes of vegetables a year. Plus we will also sell radiators and energy-saving lamps. They [investors] have shown interest in this, because they are also working in this area. We are looking for a market for our products.
Vladimir Putin: Very good.
