Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
We are pleased to again welcome you to Moscow. Very important and large-scale political events have taken place in China. We have closely followed the party congress and we would like to congratulate you on its successful conclusion. I would like to thank you for the position of the Chinese leadership on what is a sensitive area of cooperation for both of us, the fight against terror. I would like to express the gratitude of the Russian leadership for the sympathy and support on the part of the People’s Republic of China during the terrorist attack in Moscow.
My official visit to the People’s Republic of China begins in a week. My colleagues and I are preparing for this visit and looking forward to meeting the Chinese leadership. Our relations are on the rise, and I hope that we will manage to extend the frontiers during the course of this visit.
