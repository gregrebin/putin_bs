The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Last night we all heard about another outrageous terrorist attack in France. I understand that the President and many of France’s leaders are too busy now for telephone conversations. Therefore, I would like to address Mr President publicly.
Dear Francois,
Russia knows terrorism and the threat it creates for us all. Our people have had to deal with similar tragedies many times, and we are deeply distressed at the news. We would like to express our sympathy and solidarity with the French nation.
The criminal act in Nice that resulted in death and injury, including among Russian citizens, was committed with extreme brutality and cynicism.
I would like to stress again that only through a united effort can we defeat terrorism.
Mr President, I kindly ask you to pass on my words of most sincere sympathy and support to the victims’ families and friends, and wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured.
