President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
Approaching the end of the year, I would like, as we agreed earlier, to talk about the state of the economy, and hear your assessments: the credit and finance system, the pace of development, inflation, investment – that is, everything we usually discuss at our meetings on economic issues, and certainly look at the first quarter of next year – the medium term projection. I would like to look at what has been done, what we have failed to do, as well as to coordinate the work of various departments. I would like to hear from the Central Bank Governor, how the Bank sees the development of the situation, and prepare for the beginning of the next year, 2018.
So let’s get down to work.
