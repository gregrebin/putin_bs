President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
We have been proactive at various international venues and organisations, primarily the United Nations, as well as regional structures. The international community must come together to fight the pandemic, which is especially true today, as we have already discussed many times. For this reason, the way we proceed on various matters, including on the one that I have just mentioned, is very important.
