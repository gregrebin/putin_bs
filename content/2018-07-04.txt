Andrei Tarasenko
has been acting governor since October 4, 2017, and sees it as his task to recover the production that was lost in the region, and to boost the existing industries – primarily, the sea port facilities. Agriculture, specifically, crop husbandry and livestock breeding, is developing in the region.
The Acting Governor also pointed out certain problems in the region, particularly, the distribution of quotas on fish and crab fishing as well as the shortage of doctors and teachers.
