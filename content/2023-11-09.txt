Address by the President of Russia at the plenary session
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
I am delighted to address the participants of the 19th Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum, which I am attending jointly with President Tokayev
.
It is important that representatives of more than 30 regions of Russia and Kazakhstan − government officials, lawmakers, representatives of ministries and agencies, businesses, academic community and civil society − have gathered in Kostanay for this event. These are the people who deal with the practical aspects of developing the entire scope of our relations in their work on a daily basis, be it in politics, the economy or humanitarian affairs.
It is largely thanks to your energetic and proactive efforts that cooperation between our countries’ regions continues to develop, involving new participants and becoming more practical. As of now, 76 Russian regions have established direct partner ties with regions in Kazakhstan.

It is also important that interregional visits have become regular. This year, for example, very fruitful working trips, as far as I know, have been made by the heads of Yakutia and the Astrakhan and Chelyabinsk regions to various regions in Kazakhstan. Large Kazakh delegations took part in the Krasnoyarsk Economic Forum and the events held on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Buryatia.
We continue to develop and enlarge the substantive legal framework of regional cooperation, which comprises, in particular, over 60 agreements between our countries’ regional governments. As far as I know, a number of new agreements and memoranda, as well as commercial contracts worth in total about $100 million, have been prepared for signing based on the results of this forum.
It is a good example of the successful development of Russia-Kazakhstan economic ties. I would like to note in this connection that thanks to the active contribution of our regions, Russia’s trade with Kazakhstan increased by over 10 percent in 2022 and reached $28.2 billion according to our statistics, or $27 billion as the President of Kazakhstan said. In January to August 2023, our mutual trade increased by another 7 percent. At the same time, we are using national currencies for export-import transactions more actively.
Russia is one of the major investors in Kazakhstan’s economy, as we heard here earlier. The total volume of Russian investments is slightly lower, according to our statistics: my friend and colleague President Tokayev said that it was over $20 billion, and in our estimation, it is slightly over $17 billion. It is a good result and a good trend overall. Kazakhstan’s investments into Russia amount to $4.6 billion, according to our data. Some 6,000 companies with Russian capital operate in various regions of Kazakhstan, while the total cost of joint projects that are being implemented with Russian participation is $36.5 billion. It is an impressive figure for our economy.
Naturally, we are seeing that our mutual trade and mutual investments in agriculture are growing. So, it is logical that the current plenary session of the forum is devoted to a topic that is of big interest to us: Agriculture as the Foundation of a Strong Economy. I am pleased to note that you discuss various aspects of this issue in great detail and in a professional way, such as strengthening food security and introducing innovative agricultural technology.
I think that the President of Kazakhstan will agree that the development of bilateral cooperation in the agro-industrial sector is a priority both for the Russian and Kazakhstani economic policy. In fact, holding a specialised interregional forum devoted to agriculture is clear proof of this.
I would like to note that Russia is Kazakhstan’s key supplier of various products such as wheat (98 percent of imports), barley (98 percent), poultry (80–90 percent), sugar (up to 70 percent), and fermented milk products (60–70 percent).
Overall, bilateral turnover of agricultural products and foods grew by 22 percent and reached $4 billion in 2022; in the first seven months of this year, it increased by another 3 percent. Our country is ready to continue to provide the Kazakhstani market with an uninterrupted supply of these and many other crucial food products in accordance with the needs of our colleagues and friends in Kazakhstan.
It is important that the relevant Russian agencies and regional authorities along with their colleagues from Kazakhstan are taking steps towards integrating the information systems of veterinary and phytosanitary certification to ensure a complete traceability of goods shipped across the border, and to ease their delivery to the markets of both countries.
I also want to mention that our country helps Kazakhstani farmers by supplying the main types of fertilisers, as the President of Kazakhstan has just said. As we also mentioned, one of the largest in the CIS and even Europe phosphoric fertiliser production facilities, built with Russia’s assistance, operates in the Jambyl Region. Another similar chemical facility with a production capacity of up to 1 million tonnes of products is currently under construction.
In cooperation with the two countries’ regional authorities, much has been achieved in optimising the logistics of agricultural trade, removing infrastructure restrictions, and this work should certainly continue. In this context, I would like to note the great importance of successfully developing the North – South international transport logistics corridor, running from Russia, or even our partners and friends in Belarus, to the Indian Ocean coast. One of the corridor’s routes could surely run through the territory of Kazakhstan. As a matter of fact, it does run through the territory of Kazakhstan, and our common goal is to develop this corridor.
The Russian and Kazakhstani regions cooperate on large-scale joint projects focused on the production and supplies of high-quality agricultural equipment, as we said earlier. Rostselmash and St Petersburg Tractor Company, which have been mentioned, as well as other machine-building facilities, not only export their products but also localise the assembly of their products in Kazakhstan.
Russian regions make a substantial contribution to training professionals for the Kazakhstani agricultural industry. I am talking about enrolling students from Kazakhstan to our higher education institutions specialising in agriculture, as well as creating specialised education centres in the regions of Kazakhstan.
It is notable that the integration processes that are gathering momentum in the Eurasian Economic Union directly promote stronger interregional cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan in agriculture. The EAEU countries are working together to develop common commodity, including agricultural, markets and industrial and technological chains, and are also proactive in the spheres of import substitution and the digitisation of mutual trade.
The EAEU has reached the level of self-sufficiency in the majority of agricultural products. Our union firmly holds leading positions in the world in wheat production and exports. Incidentally, Russia has gathered a very good wheat harvest this year, our export potential will be maintained at 60 million tonnes, and we will undoubtedly keep the world leadership in the export of wheat and the sale of this important commodity on the global markets. The same can be said about potatoes and animal products, where our union is among the world’s top 10 suppliers of barley, corn, oil crops and frozen fish.
Thanks to mutual deliveries, the agricultural businesses of the five EAEU states harmoniously complement each other, which makes for the reliable supply of food not only to our countries but also to foreign markets. In light of our modern-day capabilities, which are growing, we are aware of our responsibility to our partners and colleagues in other countries, especially considering the trends we discussed today, including in demography, which the President of Kazakhstan has mentioned.
In conclusion, I would like to say again that interregional ties are playing a key role in Russia-Kazakhstan partnership. We will continue to encourage the regions’ desire to cooperate with each other and to look for new spheres of interaction, and we will certainly support our colleagues’ positive initiatives.
I would like to wish fruitful work and all the best to the participants and organisers of the forum. The next interregional forum will be held in Ufa, Russia, in 2024, and we certainly invite all of you to attend it.
Thank you.

President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev
: President Putin, Russian friends and colleagues, I am very pleased to once again welcome you to our capital, Astana.
Today, when you arrived in Astana early in the morning, a crescent moon appeared in the sky, accompanied by very bright stars, which is a rare phenomenon, and I drew the attention of all those people who were present at the airport to welcome you today. I believe that this is a very good sign.

Russia-Kazakhstan talks
November 9, 2023
You arrived in Kazakhstan ahead of the 10th anniversary of the Agreement [between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan] on Good Neighbourliness and Alliance in the 21st century. Let me remind you that it was signed on November 11, 2013, in Yekaterinburg. This is a comprehensive document that is an important legal foundation for bilateral cooperation. It also defines the outlook for strengthening our multifaceted ties.
Mr President, please accept my greetings on this date, and it is very good that your visit coincided with it. Of course, in general, as I already told you today, your visit has great political, and one might even say historical, significance.
Everyone knows that Kazakhstan and Russia are allies and strategic partners. We are united by strong bonds of friendship, common history and close spiritual bonds. On the eve of your visit, I gave an interview to the Izvestia newspaper, where I said that the future of our relations is very bright, just as the past of our relations was very rich. Therefore, we have preserved and multiplied our main wealth: fraternal feelings and good neighbourly relations between the two nations. I note with satisfaction that today our interaction is developing successfully.
Today, at the opening of the forum, we stated the exact figures of our growing trade. Over the past three years, it grew more than 30 percent, and fortunately this positive trend continues. In the first eight months of this year, bilateral trade amounted to $17 billion, which is a record indicator.
Industrial cooperation is developing dynamically. Here, we can see some interesting numbers: 143 industrial cooperation projects worth over $33 billion are being implemented; 140 of them are based in Kazakhstan.
Russia is an undisputed leader in terms of the number of enterprises with foreign capital in Kazakhstan. Over 20,000 Russian companies are registered in our country, and this is a very impressive number.
According to our estimates, direct Russian investment exceeds $20 billion. As far as I know, your estimate is about $17–18 billion. However, the difference is rather small, and both numbers correlate with one other. About $3.5 billion have been invested over the past two years.

Our estimates show that the volume of Kazakhstani investment has reached $6 billion, and we are delighted to note that this process is mutual.
Cooperation in the oil and gas sector continues to develop actively. Agreements on Russian oil transit to China and Russian gas transit to Uzbekistan via the territory of our country have elevated energy interaction to an entirely new level.
We have set objectives for further developing trans-border cooperation at the ongoing 19th Interregional Forum for Russia-Kazakhstan Cooperation in Kostanay. I am confident that the substantial package of agreements and business contracts will unlock the weighty potential of regions and entire sectors of our economies.
I would like to note the growing diplomatic presence of our countries and the creation of new diplomatic infrastructure. This year, the network of Kazakhstani missions expanded in Russia and now includes a consulate general in Yekaterinburg. Kazakhstan has opened consulates general in St Petersburg, Kazan, Astrakhan and Omsk, and they are operating successfully. There are plans to open a Russian consulate-general in Aktau soon. This has tremendous importance from all points of view.
New aspects of our diverse ties are emerging. We will sign important documents that will allow us to make great headway in finance, the power industry, healthcare, fitness, sport, and other fields.
All this highlights the wide-ranging bilateral agenda and our mutual striving to strengthen our strategic partnership. This is why I look into the future with optimism, given that both countries will continue to work in all areas under the stern gaze of our governments, and I believe that we should expect future achievements soon.
Thank you for your visit once again. I would like to give the floor to you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
Mr President, friends, colleagues,
We are delighted to be in the capital of Kazakhstan today, to have an opportunity to exchange opinions about the current status of our relations, and to take a look into the future.
The strategic partnership and allied relations between our countries are steadily and successfully developing, which can be clearly seen from the figures.
We have just participated in a plenary session of the 19th Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum, and while we were on our way here, the President and I shared our views on this matter. This format is very good. People can work and talk without intermediaries, and this always brings visible and significant results. I am sure the same will be true this time as well, especially since the subject is very important. Everyone knows what agriculture is all about since food is the lifeblood of any society and any country.
All the more so since we have excellent potential in view of global developments. Our colleagues discussed this, and the President and I also mentioned it. I am not talking about the conflicts, but the demographic things that are happening, I mean our enormous agricultural potential. We have good opportunities to secure our interests and to help many our partners on the global markets, which is what we are doing. The issue is about leveraging the advantages of our cooperation to boost these capabilities in the future. This is what we will do.
Indeed, the day after tomorrow marks the 10th anniversary of the basic Treaty between Russia and Kazakhstan on Neighbourliness and Alliance in the 21st century which has provided a solid foundation for expanding our multifaceted friendly relations. I would like to emphasise this very aspect of our relations: friendly relations.
Today, following the talks, we will sign a joint statement which lays out further strategic objectives to promote Russian-Kazakhstani cooperation. We will also approve a joint action plan, which defines specific areas of cooperation for the next three years. In addition, a number of important documents covering a wide range of areas of bilateral ties have been prepared for signing.
I am in constant contact with the President. We have excellent relations, both personal and business, which is certainly good for our work. I am certain that this will continue into the future.
Both of us recently took part in the CIS summit in Bishkek. Soon, we will meet in Minsk at a meeting of the Collective Security Council. Before the end of the year, we will have another chance to communicate in St Petersburg during the EAEU summit and the traditional informal New Year’s Eve meeting of the CIS leaders.
As I mentioned earlier, Russia is clearly one of Kazakhstan’s leading trade and economic partners. I will not provide the figures again, which were mentioned just now. They are very impressive, and most importantly, they provide the groundwork for future development.
The operation of our intergovernmental commission is based on a comprehensive programme of cooperation between our countries for 2021–2025, which means that the necessary legal framework is in place.
It is worth mentioning the Russian Seasons in Kazakhstan as a significant factor in promoting our cultural and humanitarian ties. I would like to say a few words about it. This year, Days of Russia will be held in Kazakhstan; I believe you plan to start them on November 17.
As for education, which is another important element in the development of our relations, I would like to say that 61,000 citizens of Kazakhstan are studying at Russian universities, and the education of 30,400 of them is funded by the Russian federal budget. We do not regard this as a waste of money. On the contrary, this is creating a solid foundation for maintaining our relations at a high level and looking toward the future. It is our investment in our future. In the 2023–2024 academic year, the government quota will be increased by another 200 citizens to 700 students.
I would like to highlight the initiative of the President of Kazakhstan to establish an International Organisation for the Russian Language, which has entered the implementation stage. I am referring to the recent decisions adopted by the CIS leaders at their summit in Bishkek and the signing of the relevant interstate agreement. Mr President, we can and do appreciate the significance of that initiative, and we are grateful to you for it.
We highly value our states’ constructive interaction in international affairs, which is based on common approaches to issues of fundamental significance. We are closely coordinating our activities within the EAEU, the CSTO, the CIS, the UN and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the rotating chairmanship of which Kazakhstan assumed in July this year.
We are working successfully together within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union, and in 2024 our countries will chair the main multilateral organisations: Russia will assume the chairmanship in BRICS and the CIS, while Kazakhstan will chair the CSTO. It goes without saying that we will support each other.
Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Thank you, Mr President.
