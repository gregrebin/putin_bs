More than 280 people from over 100 countries are taking part in the forum, including members of the association, the International Olympic Committee, Russian Government officials, the heads of Russia’s Olympic Committee and national sports federations, and Olympic champions.
The World Olympians Association was founded in 1995 and brings together 143 national Olympians associations and more than 100,000 Olympians from around the world.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, guests, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bach, Your Highness Prince of Monaco [Albert II], it gives me great pleasure to welcome everyone to the First World Olympians Forum.
It is symbolic that this event is taking place on the 20th anniversary of the World Olympians Association, which unites 143 national associations and more than 100,000 Olympians from around the world. The association is actively involved in promoting sport and the constructive and positive values that go with it. You do this through your personal examples and the real achievements of outstanding athletes, many of whom dedicate their lives to public, state or political activity and become true ambassadors for peace.
Here in Russia, we have tremendous respect for the role that legendary athletes play in modern society, and we do all we can to support them, including through the charity organisation Russian Olympians Support Fund. Let me take this opportunity to thank everyone who is contributing to this fund’s work in Russia.
Over the last 10 years, this fund has provided more than 9,500 grants to athletes, trainers and specialists on our national teams in 39 Olympic disciplines. Today, around 280 sports veterans, former Olympic champions and medal winners, are receiving grants.
We are proud of the fact that Soviet and Russian sport has given the big international Olympic family so many bright stars. I must mention a few of them now, people such as Olympic champion gymnast Larisa Latynina, who was recognised as one of the 20th century’s greatest athletes, speed skater Lidia Skoblikova and skier Lyubov Yegorova, who have mounted the Olympic pedestal’s summit six times, or skier Larisa Lazutina and Anastasia Davydova, a master of synchronised swimming, each of whom has won five Olympic gold medals. Like many outstanding sportspeople, they are known not only for the records they have set, but also for their active humanitarian and public work, and are an excellent example of responsibility and sense of purpose for young people.
This is especially important today, when sport faces challenges from violence, terrorism and doping, and when the ideals and principles of sport ever more often become hostages to political circumstances. This goes against the very spirit of the Olympic movement, which is built on the principles of respect, justice and openness. I remind you that Pierre de Coubertin, the man who was behind the modern Olympic Games’ revival, said that sport should provide an example of ethical dispute resolution, and the Olympic movement will find support because people have a need for friendship and brotherhood.
It was this approach that made the Olympic movement so welcome and enabled it to develop so widely and bring countries and peoples together, including at celebrations such as the Olympic Games, each of which has made a unique mark on history, uniting and inspiring millions of people all around the world.
The Olympic movement’s ideals – respect for other cultures and working towards harmony and stability in the world – find an echo in Russia’s own traditions and in the priorities and principles that our country defends on the international stage. This movement is fully in keeping with our priorities and principles and we adhere faithfully to the Olympic Charter, which states directly that sportspeople must not be used for political goals. We consistently support the idea that sport is outside politics.
In autumn 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution “Sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace.” It includes provisions proposed by our country, aimed at supporting sport’s autonomy. In development of this subject, we think it important to draft and adopt a UN General Assembly resolution that would definitively enshrine in international law the principle of sport’s de-politicisation.
The declaration in support of the Olympic Charter, aimed at promoting Olympic values, could be a big step towards this goal. I know that this document will be signed (or at least is being prepared for signing) following this forum.
Overall, you have many important questions for the international sports movement on your agenda. I hope that you will successfully carry out all of your planned tasks, and that this forum will become a welcome regular event.
Thank you for your attention.

With President of Syria Bashar al-Assad.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Let me wish you a warm welcome to Moscow. Despite the dramatic situation in your country, you have responded to our request and come here to Russia, and we thank you for this.
We took the decision upon your request to provide effective aid to the Syrian people in fighting the international terrorists who have unleashed a genuine war against Syria. The Syrian people has been practically alone in putting up resistance and fighting these international terrorists for several years now, and has suffered great losses. Lately though, there have been some major positive results in this fight.
The attempts by international terrorists to bring whole swathes of territory in the Middle East under their control and destabilise the situation in the region raise legitimate concerns in many countries around the world. This is a matter of concern for Russia too, given that sadly, people from the former Soviet Union, around 4,000 people at least, have taken up arms and are fighting on Syrian territory against the government forces. Of course, we cannot let these people gain combat experience and go through ideological indoctrination and then return to Russia.
On the question of a settlement in Syria, our position is that positive results in military operations will lay the base for then working out a long-term settlement based on a political process that involves all political forces, ethnic and religious groups. Ultimately, it is the Syrian people alone who must have the deciding voice here.
Syria is Russia’s friend and we are ready to make our contribution not only to the military operations and the fight against terrorism, but also to the political process. We would do this, of course, in close contact with the other global powers and with the countries in the region that want to see a peaceful settlement to this conflict.
Once again, I wish you welcome, Mr President.
President of Syria Bashar al-Assad
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I want to express our tremendous gratitude to the Russian leadership and people for the help they are providing Syria. Thank you for supporting Syria’s unity and independence. Most important of all is that this is being done within the framework of international law.
I must say that the political steps the Russian Federation has been taking since the start of the crisis made it possible to prevent events in Syria from taking an even more tragic turn. If it were not for your actions and decisions, the terrorism that is spreading through the region now would have made even greater gains and spread to even wider territories. You have confirmed your course of action by joining in the military operations as part of a common front in the fight against terrorism.
Of course, we all know that any military action must be followed by political steps. Of course, our common goal is to bring about the vision the Syrian people have of their own country’s future.
We must be particularly aware that military strikes against the terrorists are essential above all because we must fight terrorism, and also because terrorism is a real obstacle on the road to reaching a political settlement. Of course, the entire nation wants to take part in deciding the country’s fate, and not just the government.
I want to thank the Russian people once more for the help you are giving Syria and express the hope that we will vanquish terrorism and continue working together to rebuild our country economically and politically and ensure peaceful life for everyone.
