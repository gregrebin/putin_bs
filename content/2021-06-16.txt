President of Switzerland Guy Parmelin (retranslated): Mr President,
Thank you again for the opportunity to hold a discussion here in Geneva. I hope that discussions with your American counterpart were successful. I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity to communicate with you now and to discuss issues that are of interest to both our countries. It is my pleasure to do so.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, first, I would like to thank you for providing such a wonderful venue for the Russia-US summit here in Geneva.
Geneva has always been hospitable. I remember my visit exactly 10 years ago to an event hosted by the International Labour Organisation.
The 75th anniversary of our diplomatic relations was marked in March. We have many areas of interaction with 200 Swiss companies and other companies with Swiss participation operating in the Russian market. Unfortunately, last year, our trade numbers fell in the wake of the pandemic, but I think that we will improve the situation soon.
Thank you very much again.
Guy Parmelin: Thank you very much, Mr President, for the kind words.
