The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin:
Dear Mr. President, dear colleagues,
Allow me to warmly welcome you to the Kremlin.
I am very pleased that contacts between us have been developing successfully in all areas since our last meeting in Moscow. Interest is also growing among the Russian business community in cooperation with your country. We must note, unfortunately, that trade turnover has not yet reached the necessary level, but there are good prospects for relations to develop in all the areas which we discussed at our last meeting.
The region is quite complex, and we are closely following the situation not just in the region, but also within your country, Mr. President, and we note with satisfaction that you are able to maintain a certain stability.
We understand full well that this is not easy. It is the result of intense and consistent work by you and your colleagues. But we are pleased by your success, and prepared on our part to assist the stable development of Yemen however we can, and stable development of the situation in the region. We hope that cooperation between our countries will serve this purpose. And finally, I have to mention your principled position on the war on terrorism. So we are very pleased by your visit, and it is with pleasure that I say to you once again: ”Welcome!“.
