Mr President, I would like to assure you that we have come here with representatives of delegations from national federations, and our executive committee is here in full. I want to tell you that the executive committee has recently passed a new resolution, in which FIFA assures the Russian Federation of its full support for the project to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia. We have complete trust in Russia and the Russian leadership. This resolution was passed at a meeting attended by Mr Mutko.
