Vladimir Putin: Dear ladies and gentlemen,
I am glad to be able to address you and would like to express at once the most sincere interest of the Russian side in the successful work of the Roundtable.
Today information technologies have become key ones in the two countries' economic and technological cooperation. They determine and before our eyes alter the character of contemporary society and of the present-day economy. And it has to be acknowledged that information production and the management of information flows have already become a real factor in the maintenance of geopolitical stability.
I consider it extremely important that you set yourselves only concrete tasks; and in the first place â€” elaboration of practical recommendations for the bodies of power, corporations and entrepreneurs. Recommendations which can noticeably expand the commercial and investment capabilities of the two countries in the economy of high technologies.
One of the major tasks of your forum is to determine the commercial prospects for US companies on the Russian market. I am confident that Russian participants of the Roundtable will help their US colleagues discern better the potentialities of Russia as a rich source of unique science-intensive achievements.
I must also note that Russia actually has already invested its intellectual potential in the international IT market. However, many of our developments still need capitalization and their introduction into markets. And today we are ready to discuss the possibilities and forms of support for those who are planning to invest in Russian high technologies.
In conclusion I would like to express the hope for successful work of the Roundtable. I hope that your regular meeting will result not only in new contacts and ideas, but also in concrete entrepreneurial initiatives and projects.
I wish you success.
