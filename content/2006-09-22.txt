The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, dear friends and colleagues, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Russia.
We are pleased to see the growth in relations between our countries and we welcome every opportunity to meet with our friends from your region to exchange views and discuss our positions on regional issues.
At the bilateral level, our relations are developing very well. Our bilateral trade is on the increase and the number of Russian tourists visiting your country is growing every year. Last year, nearly 300,000 Russians visited your country. Our relations are also developing in the area of military-technical cooperation, a sector that exemplifies the particular degree of trust present in our ties. It is our pleasure to see you here in Moscow. Welcome.
Mohammed Al Nahyan: Thank you, Your Excellency. I am very pleased to be here in Moscow. I am here for the fifth time now, and this is my second meeting with you, Mr President. Relations between the United Arab Emirates and Russia have shown constant and steady development over this last decade.
I would like to confirm the three points you noted, Your Excellency, namely, trade, tourism and military-technical cooperation. Regarding tourism, I would like to mention that today was, I think, the last day of the International Tourism Exhibition in Moscow, where more than 60,000 Russians visited our pavilion, the pavilion of the United Arab Emirates. This makes us very happy and is a sign of the interest people here have in our country. The Abu Dhabi pavilion took first place at this exhibition.
