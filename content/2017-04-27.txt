Beginning of the meeting with Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you all to Moscow. We are very pleased to see you here in Russia’s capital. Shinzo, we have not forgotten what a warm reception you gave us in Japan, in your home province.
Japan is a good neighbour and very promising partner. During our last meeting in Yamaguti and during our talks, we agreed to intensify our relations, step up our contacts and work together. We can already review the interim results now. Progress has been made.
I hope that this visit by such a high-level Japanese delegation, headed by yourself, will produce results and enable us to outline the next steps in our joint work.
Welcome!
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): This is my first visit to Moscow in the last four years. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with Vladimir in Russia’s beautiful capital.
Let me take this opportunity to convey my sincere condolences to the families of those killed in the blast in the St Petersburg metro. We firmly condemn this ignoble terrorist attack. The Japanese stand together with the Russian people. Allow me to express our great solidarity.
As for bilateral relations, for the first time in three years and four months in March we held the 2+2 consultations. This meeting of our foreign and defence ministers produced good results.
Economic relations are developing in accordance with our eight-point cooperation plan. Following our meeting in Nagato, our bilateral relations are on a positive track and I value this step forward in developing our ties.
I would like to discuss a number of areas of bilateral relations today, including the issue of concluding a peace agreement, security, and the regional situation.
I propose that we hold a narrow-format meeting first, and then speak one-on-one.

Press statements following Russian-Japanese talks
Following their talks, Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made statements for the press.
April 27, 2017
18:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prime Minister,
These talks with Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe were constructive in nature. Let me say right away that both sides showed their desire to continue developing our mutually advantageous and multifaceted cooperation.
Japan is an important and promising partner for Russia and we are ready to work together to settle all issues, even the most complicated ones in our bilateral relations based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and consideration of each other’s interests.
Today, first in a narrow format, and then with the participation of key ministers and heads of big companies, we discussed in detail the current state of Russian-Japanese ties, examined the results of implementing the agreements reached during my visit to Japan last December, and outlined our immediate and longer-term cooperation priorities.
Mr Abe and I noted with satisfaction that our bilateral contacts have intensified of late. Thus, the 2+2 meetings between our foreign and defence ministers have resumed, our security councils are developing their dialogue, and there is growing cooperation between our parliaments.
It is good to see that after undergoing a downturn, our economic cooperation is now picking up again. In January and February this year, we saw growth in our bilateral trade. Total Japanese investment in Russia is growing too. In 2015, it came to 1.3 billion, and last year, it reached 1.7 billion.
Japan is an important and promising partner for Russia and we are ready to work together to settle all issues, even the most complicated ones in our bilateral relations based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and consideration of each other’s interests.
The Intergovernmental Commission has coordinated and is implementing an ambitious joint action plan and an overall list of 80 priority projects in industry, agriculture, the infrastructure, innovation, small business, and humanitarian exchanges.
The new Russian-Japanese Investment Fund with a capital of $1 billion will provide financial support for carrying out our bilateral business initiatives. The Investment Agency and the Far East Development Fund, together with the Japanese International Cooperation Bank, will help with investment in Russia’s Far East.
Of course, we discussed in detail with our Japanese partners the deepening of our cooperation in the strategic energy sector. Russia is a reliable energy supplier for Japan and accounts for around 8 percent of Japan’s domestic liquefied natural gas market.
Japanese business, for its part, is involved in developing the Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 oil and gas fields and in building a liquefied natural gas plant on the Yamal Peninsula. I spoke with Prime Minister Abe about our joint plans to build the Sakhalin-Hokkaido gas pipeline, an energy bridge for electricity supplies from Russia to Japan, and to work together on renewable and non-traditional energy sources. The implementation of these promising projects will give Japanese consumers new energy resources delivered via the shortest routes and at affordable prices.
There are good prospects for our cooperation in the nuclear energy sector. Russia is ready to help Japan to rebuild the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant and offers cutting edge technology for cleaning up contaminated soil and treating radioactive waste.
During the talks, we discussed deeper industrial cooperation. Russia today offers a highly comfortable environment for attracting advanced technology and developing innovative new production. The special economic zones in the priority development areas in the Far East offer investors tax holidays and simplified administrative procedures, and the state authorities are financing infrastructure modernisation. We hope that our Japanese partners will make full use of these unique opportunities. This will give them not only direct access to the Russian market but also to consumers in the Eurasian Economic Union and the CIS.
We look forward to active participation by Japanese companies and the Japanese banking sector in Russia’s biggest economic forums, the St Petersburg Forum and the Eastern Forum. We value Japan’s decision to take part in the INNOPROM 2017 international industrial fair in Yekaterinburg as a partner country.
We welcome renewed activity in our interregional ties. This visit saw the signing of a cooperation agreement between Krasnodar Territory and Yamaguti Prefecture, thereby taking implementation of the Japanese Prime Minister’s personal initiative that he put forward last December into its final stage.
Press statements following Russian-Japanese talks.
We noted an increase in cultural and humanitarian exchanges. The Russian Seasons festival will open in Japan in June. It will reach out to 40 towns with a total of 250 different events. They will bring to the Japanese public some of the best samples of Russian culture and art. I was very happy when Prime Minister Abe kindly agreed to take part in the opening of this festival in Tokyo. Next year, we have agreed to hold reciprocal years of Russia and Japan in our countries.
Of course, we discussed the peace treaty issue. A solution to this issue must be in the strategic interests of both countries and be accepted by both peoples. In this context, we discussed the possibilities for joint economic activity in the Southern Kuril Islands, as was agreed with Mr Abe when I was in Tokyo last December. We agreed to continue the joint work and will soon put together a list of priority projects. A trip by Japanese businesspeople and officials to the South Kuril Islands will be organised this summer to study specific cooperation opportunities.
Russia will also organise direct flights for former Japanese residents of the islands to visit their family graves. Mr Abe and I have discussed solutions to these humanitarian issues on many occasions now. He raised these issues and I agree with him that we should settle them. I hope that this will help to build greater trust and mutual understanding between our countries.
Of course, we also gave much attention to international issues. We discussed cooperation in multilateral organisations, particularly the UN and its Security Council, where Japan is a non-permanent member [in 2016–2017].
We discussed the situation on the Korean peninsula, which, we both agreed, has degraded considerably, to our regret. We call on all countries involved in the region’s affairs to refrain from militaristic rhetoric and work towards calm and constructive dialogue. We see swift resumption of the six-party talks as our common task.
In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Abe and to our Japanese colleagues for this engaged and business-like discussion. We agreed to continue our contacts in Vladivostok on the sidelines of the third Eastern Economic Forum, and I hope to have another chance to meet at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
Thank you for your attention.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): I am pleased to be able to visit Moscow four years after my last visit. I wholeheartedly thank President Putin and the Russian people for their warm hospitality.
First, I would like to express my grief over the barbaric terrorist attack in the St Petersburg metro, as well as my sympathy to those who were wounded, and to wish them a speedy recovery. This kind of terrorist act is an attack against all of humanity, and I strongly condemn it. In these difficult times, Japan is with you, Russia. Japan, together with Russia and the international community, will make its contribution to the fight against terrorism.
Press statements following Russian-Japanese talks. Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe.
In December 2016, I welcomed President Putin in Nagato. It was snowing. In my home town, President Putin read a letter written by former residents of the islands, former residents of the northern territories, the four northern islands, in which they shared their pain and innermost thoughts. President Putin's eyes were focused and serious. I still remember very well the expression in your eyes and the way you looked. People wrote, ”I want to be able to freely visit the grave of my ancestors, my native land, and I want to greet the morning in my small homeland.“
It was decided for the first time in history (at the news conference, President Putin frankly admitted that he was deeply moved by that letter) to arrange a flight for the families of former residents of the islands to visit the graves of their relatives. I want former residents of the islands to visit the graves of their ancestors on Kunashir and Iturup on a fine day in June. For many years, there has been only one point of entry and departure, but now the number of such points will increase. We agreed that such a point would open near the islands of Habomai this year. I would like this to happen as soon as August.
We also had an in-depth discussion about joint economic activities on the four northern islands. Japanese and Russian citizens will join efforts to produce fish and sea urchins, and develop the unique tourist opportunities of the four northern islands, including nature tourism. This will improve living standards and comfort for local Russian citizens, and will also create many new opportunities for Japanese people who will come there to engage in commerce. We have hopes for that and would like to create such a future together.
As a first step, we agreed to send a delegation with representatives of the government and private circles before the end of May. Representatives of both countries will begin to work on identifying specific projects. We will start small and eventually achieve great success in our joint economic activity. Our common efforts also focus on a peace treaty, which Vladimir and I are striving to achieve. This is a mutually beneficial historic attempt. Vladimir and I would like to strengthen mutual trust between our nations using a new approach that does not rely on old ideas, and conclude a peace treaty. Based on mutual respect and mutual benefits, as well as mutual trust, working hand in hand, Vladimir and I want to embark on the path to concluding a peace treaty.
As for the eight-point cooperation plan that I proposed last year in Sochi, it is moving forward. The President and I discussed cooperation in medical care and the urban environment. We will continue to flesh out our cooperation plans so that many Russian people can actually see progress in Japanese-Russian relations.
In 2018, the Year of Japan in Russia and the Year of Russia in Japan are due to be held simultaneously. It is an important event for the rapid expansion of bilateral cultural ties and we hope that through culture more Japanese people will come to appreciate Russia and more Russian people will feel even greater affinity for the Japanese.
Vladimir, in my hometown, Nagato, we declared our honest determination to resolve the issue of a peace treaty with our own hands. Four months have passed since then and I have come to Moscow, fulfilling my promise. During these four months tangible, step-by-step progress has been made toward our shared goal. Based on the Nagato agreement, we will intensify these steps toward our ultimate goal.
At today’s meeting with the President, we discussed the North Korea issue for quite a long time. Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and an important partner of the six-party talks. President Putin and I agreed that Japan and Russia will continue their close cooperation and urge North Korea to fully comply with UN Security Council resolutions and refrain from further provocative action.
Press statements following Russian-Japanese talks.
The world is faced with challenging issues such as the situation in Syria and the fight against terrorism, which cannot be resolved without Russia’s constructive role. We had a serious and frank discussion about how Japan and Russia should cooperate in the international community.
Vladimir and I have agreed about the next one-on-one meeting during the G20 summit in Hamburg in July. I am also looking forward to meeting him at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok in September. This year, we will take advantage of all opportunities to move Japanese-Russian relations forward in a large number of areas. I am reaffirming this commitment now.
Thank you.

Meeting with Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov
Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov reported to the President on the state corporation’s performance in 2016.
April 27, 2017
22:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chemezov, your annual report is ready. Please.
Rostec State Corporation CEO Sergei Chemezov
: Mr President, I am ready to present to you the corporation’s traditional annual report for 2016.
Despite the rather complicated macroeconomic situation, the corporation has recorded pretty good results. We have increased earnings by 11 percent to over 1.2 trillion rubles.
It is encouraging that civilian production has also been growing. Its volume has increased to 374 billion, accounting for 25 percent of the total. This is very good because we understand that the state defence order will not remain at such levels forever. Of course, there will still be something, but not such large orders anymore. So naturally, we have set all holdings the target of raising civilian production to 50 percent by 2025. Then we won’t have to depend on the military component.
Our exports have also grown, although not by much, 3 percent. Nevertheless, this represents 13.1 billion dollars, which is the amount of goods sold via Rosoboronexport.
A total of 142 billion was invested in R&D programmes in 2016, up 10 percent, including 43.9 billion of our own capital. Of course, the state helps us: nearly 100 billion was provided for investment projects. Nevertheless, we are also raising our own funds.
The average monthly pay grew 7 percent compared to 2015 and reached 44,000 rubles. This is not bad compared to Russia’s average wage, which is about 37,000 rubles.
A major business project was completed in 2016: the sale of a 12 percent stake in the Russian Helicopters holding company. We sold it to a consortium of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and foreign funds. We also signed a contract for creating facilities to assemble the Ka-226 helicopters in India.
Vladimir Putin: What is the contract worth?
Sergei Chemezov: Over one billion. We will deliver 40 helicopters and another 160 will be assembled under a licence in India.
Vladimir Putin: Over one billion dollars?
Sergei Chemezov: That’s right.
We have also completed the delivery of the S-300 air defence systems to Iran. We have fulfilled our obligations in full.
In 2016, we opened a new international airport in Zhukovsky. It will be our first airport focused on low cost airlines. At this point, seven companies make flights from Zhukovsky Airport.
We also continued our programme of building perinatal centres in 2016. We completed two such centres last year, in Orenburg and Ufa, and will complete another 13 centres this year. You have attended the opening ceremony of such a centre in Bryansk. I would like to add that over 60 percent of medical equipment supplied to these centres was made in Russia, and the majority of these were manufactured by Rostec companies.
We have completed two major projects in smart lighting in Nizhny Tagil and Ulan-Ude as part of the Bright City project. What does ‘smart’ mean? We used LEDs that were produced domestically in the fixtures, and they switch on and off depending on the time of the day, which helps cut city expenses.
Vladimir Putin: And what are the import volumes in the lighting sector?
Sergei Chemezov: Unfortunately, we still import a lot, since this type of production is just getting started. The main manufacturing facility is in St Petersburg.
Vladimir Putin: Are you referring to the Svetlana company?
Sergei Chemezov: Yes, it is called Svetlana. Production of this line has also been launched at Shvabe, Rostec’s optics division.
Kalashnikov Concern has launched five new production facilities, including the one we visited with you. I believe that this is a good example of an effective public-private partnership. At the outset, private investors held 49 percent of the stock. However, we have already taken a decision to increase their share to 75 percent, keeping 25 percent plus one share, to remain in control of arms manufacturing.
Kalashnikov has evolved into a multi-purpose manufacturer that operates far beyond the small arms segment. After acquiring a shipyard in Rybinsk it started producing motor boats both for civilian and military purposes. They also make drones that are successfully used by the Russian army. This indicates that this company has been successful.
Today one of the shareholders, Mr Bokarev, said that he wanted to invest in a new Rostec holding that makes high-precision weapons. We are now looking into what share we can sell him.
The corporation has also developed an IT analytics platform for procurement monitoring and supervision. This is an interesting piece of software that has been praised by several federal agencies. We agreed to run a pilot project on the procurement of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals with the Healthcare Ministry. If the system proves effective, it can be used in all government procurement transactions.

Working meeting with Head of North Ossetia-Alania Vyacheslav Bitarov
Head of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania Vyacheslav Bitarov updated the President on the socioeconomic situation in the republic.

Head of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania Vyacheslav Bitarov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Bitarov, you have led the republic for a year, including as elected head since last September. What is your assessment of the situation?
Head of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania Vyacheslav Bitarov
: Mr President, I would like to thank you for your trust in me a year ago, when you appointed me acting head of the republic. In September, the parliament elected me head of the republic. I can now report on our achievements over the past year.
We started by reviewing our resources, which has helped us increase our revenues by 25 percent.
Vladimir Putin: Very good.
Vyacheslav Bitarov: This also allowed us to stabilise the republic’s budget.
We have fully legalised the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages, as the head of the Federal Taxation Service reported to you. We have also increased the tax collection rate, including profit and property taxes. Taken together, this allowed us to finance the completion of the unfinished projects under targeted federal programmes, which have accumulated in the republic since 2008. We have invested over 3 billion rubles. These facilities started operating in 2016.
Also, this allowed us to provide timely funding of the delayed wages and social benefits for the people.
In addition, we are working under the 2017 targeted federal programmes and preparing a socioeconomic development programme for the republic jointly with the St Petersburg Leontief Centre for Social and Economic Research. We are working actively and have prepared an in-depth review of the republican economy and industries. We plan to complete this project by September 1 to have a comprehensive development programme for the republic for the immediate future, which is the next five years. We have decided which industries we will give priority attention to for the purposes of the republic’s social development.
In addition, we are working to implement the May 2012 executive orders, most of which we have fulfilled. Of course, there are some unresolved issues, including regarding the multifunctional centres for public and municipal services (MFC), on which we still need to work some more. We continue the project to allocate land plots to all mothers with three or more children. We have subdivided the land and now we are working to provide the infrastructure there.
We have accomplished all of this over the past year. A great deal has been done, but there are many issues which I would like to discuss with you, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: All right, let us discuss them in more detail.
