With State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Naryshkin, the work in Parliament is in full swing. There is still enough time until the end of the spring session, but I am aware that the Duma is still facing major tasks. I very much hope that our joint efforts will be consolidated and efficient, as in the previous years. In spite of the approaching summer, the deputies will work hard on fulfilling their entire plan and will work very closely with the Government.
State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin
: Mr President, in my estimation, the Parliament is working as planned. Over one hundred draft laws and legislative initiatives are currently at various stages of consideration. The process involves heated political debates, which, in my opinion, is completely normal because the Parliament is the most diplomatic state agency by its nature.
I wish to inform you that a few days ago, I invited my colleagues, the Parliament Speakers from Belarus and Kazakhstan, to discuss the parliamentary dimension of the Eurasian integration.
“If we speak about the creation of the Eurasian Union, this is a challenge that cannot be tackled without an active contribution of our three countries’ parliaments.”
Vladimir Putin: We have already talked about this before.
Sergei Naryshkin: That’s right, and you gave me instructions on this matter. The process of economic integration is proceeding actively; a supranational body has already been set up and is operating successfully, and the next issue to be tackled is establishing a parliamentary dimension.
We have launched a working group mechanism composed of parliament members, experts and representatives of the academic community from our three states. The working group’s purpose is to draft a roadmap. Naturally, the Eurasian Inter-Parliamentary Assembly has to be established first, and sooner or later the question will arise of establishing a fully-fledged parliamentary institution of the Eurasian Economic Union at first, and later of the Eurasian Union.
Vladimir Putin: I believe this is very important. We need full legal support of all the processes that occur within the Customs Union and Common Economic Space. Ultimately, all decisions of the executive authorities should be supported and reflected in laws. And if we speak about the creation of the Eurasian Union, this is a challenge that cannot be tackled without an active contribution of our three countries’ parliaments. Therefore, we will support it. I will discuss it with my counterparts in Kazakhstan and Belarus. I am sure it will be supported by all the participants in the integration process.
Sergei Naryshkin: We expect the roadmap I just mentioned to be ready by early next year.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
