Beginning of meeting with Defence Ministry leadership and heads of defence industry enterprises
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Today we are holding the third meeting on the development of the Navy.
As you know, the effectiveness of the Navy, as well as of the Armed Forces in general, largely depends on the timely receipt of data from space systems, the reliable operation of navigation and communications systems, the integration of all information resources, and artificial intelligence capabilities for solving problems on the battlefield. These are very complex issues, mainly closed to public discussion, and we will consider them in detail today.
I would like to note that the leading countries are rigorously developing modern space systems for military and dual purpose use, and upgrading and improving their technical specifications. As for the US military-political leaders, they actually quite openly consider outer space as a theatre of war and, accordingly, are planning military operations there.
To maintain strategic superiority in this area, the United States is accelerating the development of space forces, which are already carrying out operational training for this purpose.
Russia has consistently opposed and will continue to oppose the militarisation of space. At the same time, the developments in this context require us to focus on strengthening the orbital group, as well as the aerospace industry as a whole.
Russia’s defence and dual-purpose orbit constellation has benefited from significant upgrades in recent years, considerably enhancing the capability of the missile warning system’s space components.
Satellites within the Unified Space System can promptly detect ballistic launches from military bases and from sea, and send alerts to the country’s leadership and the national command post and to operations centres.
This essential element in the airspace defence system once again proved its effectiveness during the Grom-2019 strategic command-post exercises.
Let me add that this year, we have completed the deployment of a high-speed communication space complex in geostationary orbit.
Of course, we are committed to laying the groundwork for future advances in this area. Defence institutions are developing new systems and complexes, and manufacturers are learning to make spacecraft using Russian-made components.
In May 2019, we had a separate meeting to discuss the current state and future of the space troops within the Aerospace Forces, and instructions to this effect were issued following the meeting. Today, I would like to hear from you about their implementation.
There is another important subject that is relevant for all services and branches of the Armed Forces. I am referring to developing and delivering up-to-date electronic warfare systems.
Over the past years, companies operating in the defence industry have created over 20 electronic warfare technology samples designed to enable electronic warfare troops to deliver on their mission, while surpassing similar foreign solutions.
We need to keep improving these systems, as well as data systems for ensuring the effective deployment of troops.
In doing so, we need to keep in mind the experience of using electronic warfare technology in exercises and during combat, considering that they were used quite actively during the operation in Syria.
I would like to ask you to report on the priorities in this critical sphere.

Beginning of Russia-Serbia talks in restricted format
December 4, 2019
14:25
Sochi
With President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic during Russia-Serbia talks in restricted format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
Welcome to Russia. We are delighted to see you. Thank you for accepting our invitation.
Our relations are developing very positively. Our strategic partnership is being reaffirmed by our daily work. This concerns both the political sphere and our interaction in the fields of security and the economy.
Last year, our trade increased by 2 percent, and from January to September this year it went up by over 10 percent. The intergovernmental commission and other bodies created with the aim of promoting our relations are functioning actively.
I hope that we will be able to discuss all of this during your visit. Once again, welcome.
President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic
: Mr President, friends,
I am delighted to be meeting with you again. Thank you for your kind words and for your hospitality here in Sochi. My dear friend, thank you very much for finding the time in your busy schedule for meeting with us. Of course, this is a great privilege for me and for all of us.
Every meeting with you is very important for my country, Serbia. I would like to thank you once again for your invariable support for Serbia, for helping us to preserve our territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty, and for your support on the international stage.
I must tell you that I am not optimistic about – how shall we put it? – the final solution that could become a compromise between Belgrade and Pristina. However, as you have just mentioned, we will talk about this later.
I must also say that our economic cooperation and trade are growing every year. In addition to this, we have accomplished a great deal in the sphere of gas pipeline construction. In fact, we have almost completed laying the gas pipeline across Serbia.
It is a huge investment project and a great opportunity for the development of my country and a safe future for our people.
I would like to point out that we are working closely together with Russian Railways (RZD), a highly professional and responsible player and Serbia’s partner.
Of course, we are grateful to you, Mr President, and to Mr Shoigu
, for the high standards of our military-technical cooperation. I believe that there is much more that we can do in the future.
We have very fond memories of your landmark visit to Serbia and Belgrade, because it gave a powerful boost to the further development of our relations. We invite you to visit Serbia again in the near future.
I have brought you a letter from Serbian Patriarch Irinej. Thank you once again. I wish the Russian people and Russia all the best.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. We hope you will come to Moscow next May.
Aleksandar Vucic: Thank you for the invitation.
