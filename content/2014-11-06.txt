Meeting with members of CSTO Parliamentary Assembly.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, colleagues. I am very glad to see all of you.
Our relations in the CSTO
framework with our partner countries and allies are flourishing. We have clearly outlined our goals and tasks. We are successfully working to strengthen the security of our states in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking, and we have created appropriate mechanisms and tools in all these areas. Everything we do is actively supported by the heads of states.
I am very pleased to see representatives of Afghanistan and Serbia here. In this regard, we must note that the situation, as it is developing in Afghanistan, certainly attracts attention around the world, not least in the CSTO zone. We wish the Afghan people success in normalising the situation in the country, but we realise that challenges will arise following the international contingent’s withdrawal. If necessary, we are ready to lend a hand to our Afghan friends, to ensure the situation in the country remains stable and has positive development prospects.
Certainly, without your support, without the support of the public in our countries, different political forces that you represent in representative bodies of power, in parliament, it would be difficult or even impossible to tackle the tasks facing us.
This is because conducting the activities we are talking about – and this includes both training and the real fight against organised crime – would be very difficult without broad public support, without all the political forces understanding the importance of our joint efforts. Therefore, we hope that we will work jointly and effectively, and that we will have your support and the backing of all political forces represented in our countries’ parliaments. 
I am very pleased that Russia is hosting this meeting. I am sure that it will be useful and will provide the support we need in addressing the challenges we face today.

Colleagues, I wish you every success and please convey my best wishes to the heads of states and governments of your countries.
