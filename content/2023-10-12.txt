President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends.
I am very happy to present a high state award of the Russian Federation, the Order of Honour, to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov.
Mr Japarov,
You have made a great deal and continue to make extensive efforts for the comprehensive development of the strategic partnership and alliance between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. You have been a firm advocate of strengthening Russia-Kyrgyzstan relations that are invariably based on the principles of equality, mutual respect and consideration for each party’s interests.
It will not be an exaggeration to say that, to a great extent, many significant achievements in the development of Russia-Kyrgyzstan ties in politics, the economy, science, education and culture – the issues we have just discussed – have become possible thanks in no small part to your active position and personal involvement in achieving results.
We know you as a committed supporter of consistently advancing Eurasian integration and strengthening the atmosphere of partnership, trust and cooperation in the region we share.
I am convinced that you will continue to pay as much attention to the relationship between our countries, and you can count on equally constructive engagement and interest from Russia.
Congratulations on receiving the Order of Honour. I wish you good health, success in your government service and simply all the best.
Thank you.
(Vladimir Putin presents the award.)
President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov: Mr President, thank you very much for presenting me with such a high award of the Russian Federation.
Frankly, your decision came as a total surprise to me and was great news. I consider this award as recognition of the high level of Russia-Kyrgyzstan relations. I am also committed to doing my best to develop our integration potential within the CIS, the CSTO and the EAEU.
Thank you once again for this award.

The beginning of Russian-Kyrgyz talks
President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov
: President Putin, members of the delegation,
I wholeheartedly welcome you and members of the Russian delegation to Bishkek.
First of all, I would like to say that your visit has a major symbolic meaning because it is held on the 20th anniversary of the Kant Air Force Base and the 30th anniversary of Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University. These singular events in our bilateral relations are the symbols of our friendship.
We highly value the strategic partnership and allied relations between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. A few weeks ago, on Knowledge Day, marked on September 1, we attended the ceremony to launch the construction of the first three Russian-language schools in Kyrgyzstan. I am confident that the future graduates of these schools will make a large contribution to the strengthening of Russian-Kyrgyz relations.
In this context, I would like to note the active growth of contacts and exchanges between our countries departments and regions, as well as people-to-people diplomacy, namely
Memory Train, Scarlet Sails and concerts by the masters and young ballet professionals in Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan and Kazan. Fifteen students will visit Russia soon within the framework of the Interdom for Children of Kyrgyzstan project.
We also appreciate the recent visit by the leaders of the Russian Government, the Emergencies Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Russian National Guard and other delegations to Bishkek.
It is notable that development of our common future is based on the solid foundation of the traditional relations of friendship. We have the basis and good prospects for strengthening relations of alliance and strategic partnership between Russia and Kyrgyzstan.
Mr President, you have the floor. Please.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues.
First of all, I would like to thank the President for the invitation.
We had really good reasons to meet, but even without them, this visit is long overdue, and we have been talking about this for a long time. I am delighted to be in Kyrgyzstan today.
We highly appreciate the work done by Kyrgyzstan during its chairmanship of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Russia is taking over the baton from Kyrgyzstan; it will chair the CIS in 2024.
We also have a busy bilateral agenda. Indeed, as my colleague has just noted, there are dates that should be given enough attention, and overall, our ties are expanding successfully.
In this regard, our delegation’s agenda is also full. We will take part in events dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Russian military base in Kant.
As for economic cooperation, Russia is one of Kyrgyzstan’s leading trade and economic partners. Last year, bilateral trade increased by 37 percent to a record high of almost $3.5 billion and added another 17.9 percent in the first half of this year.
Russia is the largest investor in the Kyrgyz economy, accounting for about 36 percent of accumulated foreign direct investment in that country. There are 800 companies with Russian capital in the republic.
Our intergovernmental commission is carrying out this work. Its Russian co-chair is Mr Overchuk, who is on my left, and on the Kyrgyz side, Prime Minister Japarov. We believe that the work is going well. The intergovernmental programme of economic cooperation until 2026 is in progress.
The business council met shortly before our meeting, reaffirming the interest of businesses on both sides in joint projects in energy, industry, agriculture, and high technology.
Region-to-region ties are also growing fast. More than 80 Russian regions are actively cooperating with all seven regions of Kyrgyzstan. The 10th Russia-Kyrgyzstan interregional conference took place yesterday, and I think it was very useful. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Friendship Park of the Regions of Russia and Kyrgyzstan was also held there. Those are significant and very positive steps.
I would like to conclude my opening remarks now, and as we have agreed, we will give the floor to our colleagues who can tell us in more detail about every area of our cooperation.
Thank you very much.
Sadyr Japarov: Very well, thank you.
Mr President,
The expanding trade, economic and investment ties with Russia certainly play a key role for us. In this regard, we are committed to increasing bilateral trade.

Official event marking the 20th anniversary of establishing a Russian air base in Kyrgyzstan

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Comrade officers, dear friends,
We have gathered here to celebrate, in an impressive setting, the very significant 20th anniversary of establishing a consolidated Russian airbase in the city of Kant, the Kyrgyz Republic. This is a milestone for cooperation with our Kyrgyz friends in defence and for strengthening overall regional security.
I would like to recall that this Russian airbase was established in Kyrgyzstan following a proposal by the Kyrgyz leadership during a complicated period when international terrorists attacked the republic from Afghanistan. The deployment of our military contingent became a decisive factor in countering and fighting this threat that emanated from another country.
Over the past 20 years, the airbase has played and continues to play a key role in ensuring the security of Kyrgyzstan and providing air support for the Rapid Deployment Forces of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation in the Central Asian region.
Russian service personnel stationed in Kyrgyzstan are serving honourably; they are successfully accomplishing their diverse objectives and helping Kyrgyz law enforcement agencies fight extremism, terrorism, illegal drug trafficking and organised crime.
The airbase operates under CSTO’s primary objectives. For example, its aircrews were involved in the organisation’s special mission to reinstate law and order in Kazakhstan in January 2022.
I would also like to point out that today service personnel from Kant Airbase are taking part in the CSTO collective force exercise, Indestructible Brotherhood-2023 being held in Kyrgyzstan and, together with units from other member states of the organisation, are training to work as a team in peacekeeping operations. I would like to emphasise that the service personnel at Kant Airbase work professionally, with full dedication, showing bravery and heroism. It is no coincidence that many of them have been honoured with Russian state awards, including the Order of Courage.
And of course, I would like to thank our Kyrgyz friends for their assistance in the operation of the airbase in the Republic and for their kind attitude towards our service personnel and their families. We certainly value this.
For my part, I would like to assure you that Russian leadership will continue to pay close attention to providing the airbase with the most advanced weapons, modern equipment and facilities. We will do everything necessary to resolve any domestic or social concerns of these service members.
Speaking directly to the command of the Kant Airbase, to all its personnel, I would like to emphasise once again: we highly appreciate the fact that you are performing difficult service abroad, far from your homeland. We understand that this is associated with certain difficulties, but it also imposes a special responsibility on you; it requires constant vigilance, composure, tact and friendly attitude towards the host country’s people. I know you will not let us down. I count on you.
I know that while you are at this leading outpost, performing your daily military duty, you will be faithful to your oath and to the Fatherland.
And of course, I expect that military and defence industry cooperation between Russia and Kyrgyzstan, our allied relations, symbolised by the presence of the Russian military force in Kant, will continue to strengthen and expand to ensure the security of our two countries.
Thank you for your attention.
President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov
: Mr President, dear friends!
It is a great pleasure for me to be here today at this official event marking the 20th anniversary of opening this airbase in the city of Kant and to congratulate all of you on this landmark event in Kyrgyz-Russian relations.
In 2003, in an effort to strengthen the security of the Central Asian region, our two countries decided to establish a military airbase at the airfield in Kant. The base later became part of the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces in the Central Asian collective security region.
This made it possible to expand the Collective Security Treaty Organisation’s collective forces and to further organise a collective security system that can meet today’s threats.
Mr President, we can say confidently that the opening of the Kant Airbase was an essential and timely measure.
Against the backdrop of turbulent geopolitical reality when the global and regional situation is developing rapidly and rather unpredictably, and when additional factors that impact the security of the Central Asian region’s countries are emerging, the issue of ensuring regional security is a high-priority objective.
As a component of the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian collective security region, this Russian airbase successfully accomplishes its objectives and serves to deter terrorist and extremist threats in the region.
On the whole, the opening of the airbase served as a good foundation for expanding military and military-technical cooperation, including the creation of a substantial regulatory legal framework and establishing stable mechanisms for military interaction.
Today, we have provided for the uninterrupted operation of this consolidated Russian military base, including the aviation component. In the past 20 years, we have put considerable joint efforts into expanding the infrastructure, beefing up the combat component and creating favourable social conditions for the everyday life of its personnel.
Mr President, and everyone here,
Since its establishment, the Kant Airbase and the Russian military personnel have traditionally taken part in international military exercises held both in the Kyrgyz Republic and in neighbouring countries.
This year, the Russian side supported Kyrgyzstan’s initiative to include warships from the Russian Navy test base in Karakol in the joint CSTO peacekeeping exercise, Indestructible Brotherhood-2023, and to conduct several sessions of the exercise in the waters of Lake Issyk-Kul. This is yet further evidence of the high level of mutual understanding achieved between our armed forces.
Mr President,
Yesterday, our parliament ratified the agreement on establishing a united regional air defence system of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Russian Federation, which was signed in Moscow.
I am convinced that once established, the regional air defence system will be an effective means of protecting our common airspace from threats and will contribute to strengthening mutual relations in the military sphere.
In this context, I would like to note our interest in continuing cooperation in this important area by upgrading military equipment and infrastructure, training military personnel and exchanging experience.
Mr President, everyone!
Today we can say with full confidence that Russia’s Kant Airbase is a reliable guarantor of security and stability in the Central Asian region.
I sincerely congratulate the personnel of the Kant Airbase on its 20th anniversary. I wish you good health, peaceful skies, prosperity and further success in the noble cause of serving the Fatherland.
Thank you for your attention.
