President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends.
I am very happy to present a high state award of the Russian Federation, the Order of Honour, to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov.
Mr Japarov,
You have made a great deal and continue to make extensive efforts for the comprehensive development of the strategic partnership and alliance between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. You have been a firm advocate of strengthening Russia-Kyrgyzstan relations that are invariably based on the principles of equality, mutual respect and consideration for each party’s interests.
It will not be an exaggeration to say that, to a great extent, many significant achievements in the development of Russia-Kyrgyzstan ties in politics, the economy, science, education and culture – the issues we have just discussed – have become possible thanks in no small part to your active position and personal involvement in achieving results.
We know you as a committed supporter of consistently advancing Eurasian integration and strengthening the atmosphere of partnership, trust and cooperation in the region we share.
I am convinced that you will continue to pay as much attention to the relationship between our countries, and you can count on equally constructive engagement and interest from Russia.
Congratulations on receiving the Order of Honour. I wish you good health, success in your government service and simply all the best.
Thank you.
(Vladimir Putin presents the award.)
President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov: Mr President, thank you very much for presenting me with such a high award of the Russian Federation.
Frankly, your decision came as a total surprise to me and was great news. I consider this award as recognition of the high level of Russia-Kyrgyzstan relations. I am also committed to doing my best to develop our integration potential within the CIS, the CSTO and the EAEU.
Thank you once again for this award.

The beginning of Russian-Kyrgyz talks
President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov
: President Putin, members of the delegation,
I wholeheartedly welcome you and members of the Russian delegation to Bishkek.
First of all, I would like to say that your visit has a major symbolic meaning because it is held on the 20th anniversary of the Kant Air Force Base and the 30th anniversary of Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University. These singular events in our bilateral relations are the symbols of our friendship.
We highly value the strategic partnership and allied relations between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. A few weeks ago, on Knowledge Day, marked on September 1, we attended the ceremony to launch the construction of the first three Russian-language schools in Kyrgyzstan. I am confident that the future graduates of these schools will make a large contribution to the strengthening of Russian-Kyrgyz relations.
In this context, I would like to note the active growth of contacts and exchanges between our countries departments and regions, as well as people-to-people diplomacy, namely
Memory Train, Scarlet Sails and concerts by the masters and young ballet professionals in Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan and Kazan. Fifteen students will visit Russia soon within the framework of the Interdom for Children of Kyrgyzstan project.
We also appreciate the recent visit by the leaders of the Russian Government, the Emergencies Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Russian National Guard and other delegations to Bishkek.
It is notable that development of our common future is based on the solid foundation of the traditional relations of friendship. We have the basis and good prospects for strengthening relations of alliance and strategic partnership between Russia and Kyrgyzstan.
Mr President, you have the floor. Please.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues.
First of all, I would like to thank the President for the invitation.
We had really good reasons to meet, but even without them, this visit is long overdue, and we have been talking about this for a long time. I am delighted to be in Kyrgyzstan today.
We highly appreciate the work done by Kyrgyzstan during its chairmanship of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Russia is taking over the baton from Kyrgyzstan; it will chair the CIS in 2024.
We also have a busy bilateral agenda. Indeed, as my colleague has just noted, there are dates that should be given enough attention, and overall, our ties are expanding successfully.
In this regard, our delegation’s agenda is also full. We will take part in events dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Russian military base in Kant.
As for economic cooperation, Russia is one of Kyrgyzstan’s leading trade and economic partners. Last year, bilateral trade increased by 37 percent to a record high of almost $3.5 billion and added another 17.9 percent in the first half of this year.
Russia is the largest investor in the Kyrgyz economy, accounting for about 36 percent of accumulated foreign direct investment in that country. There are 800 companies with Russian capital in the republic.
Our intergovernmental commission is carrying out this work. Its Russian co-chair is Mr Overchuk, who is on my left, and on the Kyrgyz side, Prime Minister Japarov. We believe that the work is going well. The intergovernmental programme of economic cooperation until 2026 is in progress.
The business council met shortly before our meeting, reaffirming the interest of businesses on both sides in joint projects in energy, industry, agriculture, and high technology.
Region-to-region ties are also growing fast. More than 80 Russian regions are actively cooperating with all seven regions of Kyrgyzstan. The 10th Russia-Kyrgyzstan interregional conference took place yesterday, and I think it was very useful. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Friendship Park of the Regions of Russia and Kyrgyzstan was also held there. Those are significant and very positive steps.
I would like to conclude my opening remarks now, and as we have agreed, we will give the floor to our colleagues who can tell us in more detail about every area of our cooperation.
Thank you very much.
Sadyr Japarov: Very well, thank you.
Mr President,
The expanding trade, economic and investment ties with Russia certainly play a key role for us. In this regard, we are committed to increasing bilateral trade.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Comrade officers, dear friends,
We have gathered here to celebrate, in an impressive setting, the very significant 20th anniversary of establishing a consolidated Russian airbase in the city of Kant, the Kyrgyz Republic. This is a milestone for cooperation with our Kyrgyz friends in defence and for strengthening overall regional security.
I would like to recall that this Russian airbase was established in Kyrgyzstan following a proposal by the Kyrgyz leadership during a complicated period when international terrorists attacked the republic from Afghanistan. The deployment of our military contingent became a decisive factor in countering and fighting this threat that emanated from another country.
Over the past 20 years, the airbase has played and continues to play a key role in ensuring the security of Kyrgyzstan and providing air support for the Rapid Deployment Forces of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation in the Central Asian region.
Russian service personnel stationed in Kyrgyzstan are serving honourably; they are successfully accomplishing their diverse objectives and helping Kyrgyz law enforcement agencies fight extremism, terrorism, illegal drug trafficking and organised crime.
The airbase operates under CSTO’s primary objectives. For example, its aircrews were involved in the organisation’s special mission to reinstate law and order in Kazakhstan in January 2022.
I would also like to point out that today service personnel from Kant Airbase are taking part in the CSTO collective force exercise, Indestructible Brotherhood-2023 being held in Kyrgyzstan and, together with units from other member states of the organisation, are training to work as a team in peacekeeping operations. I would like to emphasise that the service personnel at Kant Airbase work professionally, with full dedication, showing bravery and heroism. It is no coincidence that many of them have been honoured with Russian state awards, including the Order of Courage.
And of course, I would like to thank our Kyrgyz friends for their assistance in the operation of the airbase in the Republic and for their kind attitude towards our service personnel and their families. We certainly value this.
For my part, I would like to assure you that Russian leadership will continue to pay close attention to providing the airbase with the most advanced weapons, modern equipment and facilities. We will do everything necessary to resolve any domestic or social concerns of these service members.
Speaking directly to the command of the Kant Airbase, to all its personnel, I would like to emphasise once again: we highly appreciate the fact that you are performing difficult service abroad, far from your homeland. We understand that this is associated with certain difficulties, but it also imposes a special responsibility on you; it requires constant vigilance, composure, tact and friendly attitude towards the host country’s people. I know you will not let us down. I count on you.
I know that while you are at this leading outpost, performing your daily military duty, you will be faithful to your oath and to the Fatherland.
And of course, I expect that military and defence industry cooperation between Russia and Kyrgyzstan, our allied relations, symbolised by the presence of the Russian military force in Kant, will continue to strengthen and expand to ensure the security of our two countries.
Thank you for your attention.
President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov
: Mr President, dear friends!
It is a great pleasure for me to be here today at this official event marking the 20th anniversary of opening this airbase in the city of Kant and to congratulate all of you on this landmark event in Kyrgyz-Russian relations.
In 2003, in an effort to strengthen the security of the Central Asian region, our two countries decided to establish a military airbase at the airfield in Kant. The base later became part of the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces in the Central Asian collective security region.
This made it possible to expand the Collective Security Treaty Organisation’s collective forces and to further organise a collective security system that can meet today’s threats.
Mr President, we can say confidently that the opening of the Kant Airbase was an essential and timely measure.
Against the backdrop of turbulent geopolitical reality when the global and regional situation is developing rapidly and rather unpredictably, and when additional factors that impact the security of the Central Asian region’s countries are emerging, the issue of ensuring regional security is a high-priority objective.
As a component of the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian collective security region, this Russian airbase successfully accomplishes its objectives and serves to deter terrorist and extremist threats in the region.
On the whole, the opening of the airbase served as a good foundation for expanding military and military-technical cooperation, including the creation of a substantial regulatory legal framework and establishing stable mechanisms for military interaction.
Today, we have provided for the uninterrupted operation of this consolidated Russian military base, including the aviation component. In the past 20 years, we have put considerable joint efforts into expanding the infrastructure, beefing up the combat component and creating favourable social conditions for the everyday life of its personnel.
Mr President, and everyone here,
Since its establishment, the Kant Airbase and the Russian military personnel have traditionally taken part in international military exercises held both in the Kyrgyz Republic and in neighbouring countries.
This year, the Russian side supported Kyrgyzstan’s initiative to include warships from the Russian Navy test base in Karakol in the joint CSTO peacekeeping exercise, Indestructible Brotherhood-2023, and to conduct several sessions of the exercise in the waters of Lake Issyk-Kul. This is yet further evidence of the high level of mutual understanding achieved between our armed forces.
Mr President,
Yesterday, our parliament ratified the agreement on establishing a united regional air defence system of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Russian Federation, which was signed in Moscow.
I am convinced that once established, the regional air defence system will be an effective means of protecting our common airspace from threats and will contribute to strengthening mutual relations in the military sphere.
In this context, I would like to note our interest in continuing cooperation in this important area by upgrading military equipment and infrastructure, training military personnel and exchanging experience.
Mr President, everyone!
Today we can say with full confidence that Russia’s Kant Airbase is a reliable guarantor of security and stability in the Central Asian region.
I sincerely congratulate the personnel of the Kant Airbase on its 20th anniversary. I wish you good health, peaceful skies, prosperity and further success in the noble cause of serving the Fatherland.
Thank you for your attention.

President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov
: Ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to welcome President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin on an official visit to Kyrgyzstan.
I am delighted that President Putin has returned the official visit I made to Russia five months ago. It is yet further proof of the strong interstate relations between Russia and Kyrgyzstan.
I would like to note with satisfaction that the agreements reached during our meeting in Moscow are being implemented.
President Putin and I held substantive talks on current aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation between our countries, which are strategic partners. We reaffirmed our strong commitment to stimulating and expanding our bilateral cooperation. Evidence of this is the bilateral documents we have signed.
We share the opinion that trade between our countries is below our countries’ potential. In this connection, we agreed to take measures to increase mutual trade and to strive for the ambitious target of $5 billion.
During our talks, we highlighted cooperation in investment, fuel and energy, as well as agriculture. We have decided to intensify the efforts of our governments towards economic diversification and the implementation of major investment projects aimed at boosting our economic interaction.
Today we also pointed out the importance of using bilateral mechanisms, in particular, the Intergovernmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation and the Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund, in the interests of our countries’ development.
I would like to note with satisfaction the positive results of the 10th Kyrgyzstan-Russia Interregional Conference on Industrial Cooperation, which took place in Jalal-Abad yesterday and included representatives of the regions and business communities of our countries. I would like to emphasise that this platform is highly popular and has great potential. It is gratifying to note that the conference led to the signing of documents and contracts exceeding $3,5 billion.
I would also like to note that we place great emphasis on expanding cultural and humanitarian cooperation with Russia. In this regard, I would like to note the role of the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University, which has become one of the leaders in higher education and science in Kyrgyzstan over the past 30 years. Since its inception, the university has produced a large number of highly qualified specialists now working in Kyrgyzstan, Russia and other countries.
It should be noted that Kyrgyzstan’s chairmanship in the Commonwealth of Independent States coincided with the Year of Russian as the Language of Interethnic Communication in the CIS. The city of St Petersburg was also announced the cultural capital of the CIS in 2023.
We also discussed the celebration of the 95th birth anniversary of Chingiz Aitmatov, an outstanding writer, on a global scale.
Speaking of security, we noted the positive role of the joint Russian military base in Kant and spoke in favour of strengthening cooperation in the fight against international terrorism, extremism, drug and arms trafficking, cybercrime and other forms of transnational organised crime, both bilaterally and at international organisations.
Cooperation between Kyrgyzstan and Russia in the EAEU has particular relevance. We will make every effort to further deepen integration processes and achieve the goals of the union.
The results of this visit inspire optimism about the further development of Kyrgyz-Russian relations.
It is with great pleasure that I now give the floor to our dear guest, the President of Russia.
Please, Mr President.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues. Ladies and gentlemen,
I fully agree with President Japarov: today's talks indeed took place in a friendly and constructive atmosphere. They were also very productive – our colleagues talked to each other, and almost all of the participants spoke and made their proposals for the development of our cooperation.
We substantively discussed the entire range of bilateral ties, as well as current regional and international issues. An extensive package of interstate and interdepartmental documents has been prepared for the visit. You have just seen the signing ceremony for them.
When discussing trade and economic partnership, we all noted with satisfaction that last year, bilateral trade increased by 37 percent and reached a record high of $3.4 billion, and added almost 18 percent in the first half of this year. And I fully agree with my colleague, the President – we certainly have good prospects for further growth.
Our countries are quickly shifting to national currencies in bilateral trade and building stable channels of lending and banking cooperation. As a result, the share of the ruble in counter commercial transactions reached an impressive 83 percent.
Russia is the biggest investor in the Kyrgyz economy. One third of all direct foreign investment in the country comes from Russia. There are some 800 Russian-Kyrgyz enterprises engaged in such key sectors as energy, mining, machine-building, agriculture and transport that are successfully operating in the republic.
Important support to the Kyrgyz economy is being provided by the bilateral Development Fund, completely financed by Russia. Through the Fund, some $520 million was invested in over 3,000 joint projects in the real sector of the Kyrgyz economy. I want to note that as of late, these projects, with the direct involvement and support of the President of Kyrgyzstan, have become sustainable in a major way, which is very important for the development of the republic’s economy.
The bilateral intergovernmental commission, whose regular meeting took place in Bishkek this March, is operating and achieving good results.
As it was already said, Jalal-Abad yesterday hosted the 10th anniversary meeting of the Russia-Kyrgyzstan Interregional Conference, which brought together heads of regions and municipalities, ministries, agencies and parliamentarians, as well as business, expert and civic representatives from the two countries.
President Japarov and I have sent video greetings to the conference participants and praised the practical role that our multifaceted interregional cooperation plays in strengthening interaction between the two countries.
I want to note that Russia and Kyrgyzstan are closely cooperating within the Eurasian Economic Union; along with other member states, we are working on creating common markets of goods, services, capital and labour.
It is obvious that Eurasian integration yields undeniable dividends to all participants in the process, including, of course, Kyrgyzstan. For instance, in the past eight years since the republic joined the EAEU, its GDP and industrial output has increased by 130 percent. Exports have doubled.
It was emphasised during the talks that energy is among the most important spheres of Russian-Kyrgyz cooperation. Our country is the primary supplier of petroleum products to Kyrgyzstan. We fully cover Kyrgyz consumers’ needs in gasoline and diesel fuel. Last year, we exported nearly 1.2 million tonnes of fuel, and we plan to supply as much by the end of this year. These supplies are carried out on concessional terms free of export duty, which also has a direct economic effect for the Republic and economic operators.
Gazprom is instrumental in providing help to the Kyrgyz government’s gasification programme and has already invested 18 billion rubles in Kyrgyzstan’s gas supply system covering 30 percent of the Kyrgyz territory with gas supply infrastructure. We are aware that the President of Kyrgyzstan has set a goal for all participants in this process to cover 60 percent of the territory, and we will be there to contribute to this effort.
Bilateral industrial cooperation is expanding. With Russia’s participation, the Talas Gold Mining Complex was built and put into operation at the Jerooy deposit in northwestern Kyrgyzstan. Joint production of monocrystalline plates for solar power stations is currently in progress in Kyrgyzstan.
Today, President Japarov and I focused on expanding bilateral military and defence industry cooperation. In a short while, we will participate in a ceremonial event dedicated to a significant milestone, namely, the 20th anniversary of the Russian airbase Kant.
This military outpost significantly strengthens the Republic’s defence capabilities, ensuring security and stability throughout the Central Asian region and addressing acute challenges and threats such as terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking, and organised crime. Currently, the servicemen stationed at Kant are taking part in the Indestructible Brotherhood-2023 peacekeeping exercises conducted by the CSTO on Kyrgyzstan’s territory.
President Japarov and I were just talking about the founding of Kant, and I remember very well how this airbase was created. The Republic’s leadership directly approached the Russian Federation with a request to swiftly deploy our aviation wing here because Kyrgyzstan was under attack by armed groups, and many people were impacted, which required a rapid joint response. Today, this base has acquired a major status and regional importance.
Today we also mark another important anniversary, 30 years of the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University. This anniversary once again emphasises the multi-dimensional nature of the Russia-Kyrgyzstan partnership that extends to many areas, including, certainly, cultural and humanitarian affairs.
The Slavic University has 8,500 students from 20 countries. In 2023, Russia allocated around 450 million rubles for the university’s activities.
In addition to that, branches of Russian higher education institutions open in the Kyrgyz regions. There is a centre of the Lomonosov Moscow State University in Osh. A branch of Moscow State University will soon open in Karakol. More than 100 teachers from Russia were sent to Kyrgyzstan this year as part of the Russian Teacher Abroad project. We understand that it is not a sufficient number and the President of Kyrgyzstan has goals that are more ambitious – and we fully support this and will move in this direction.
I want to mention that overall, 16,000 Kyrgyz students study in Russian universities, including around 7,000 who study tuition-free.
Russia also helps Kyrgyzstan to develop its Russian-language secondary education system. I should mention that on September 1, President Japarov and I launched the construction of three Russian-language schools – in Bishkek, Batken and Karakol. In the next few years, we plan to build nine Russian-language schools in all seven regions and in the two biggest cities, for more than 11,000 pupils.
When we exchanged opinions on the most topical regional and global issues, we confirmed that Russia and Kyrgyzstan have close or overlapping positions, as diplomats like to say. Our countries coordinate their work within the UN and other leading international platforms, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Commonwealth of Independent States whose summit we will attend tomorrow.
Finally, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our Kyrgyz friends and President Japarov for our productive work together. I am confident that the results of this visit will help the allied relations between Russia and Kyrgyzstan continue to progress, and will certainly benefit all citizens of the two countries.
Thank you very much.

will take part in a meeting of the Council of CIS
Heads of State in Bishkek.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Aliyev,
I am very happy to see you. Last time we were speaking on the phone.
Of course, the number one issue is the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, let us be direct. However, we also have another agenda, which is quite extensive.
I suggest structuring our work the following way: let us perhaps begin with the second part and give the floor to our colleagues, and then, when we are face to face, we will discuss the full spectrum, including sensitive issues.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev: Thank you, Mr Putin.
I am glad to see you again.
As you have noted, we had a talk recently, and it is gratifying that you found time for a meeting during your state visit to Kyrgyzstan.
In fact, there are many issues, and I think that your proposal is quite reasonable: my colleagues and I will talk about the bilateral agenda, especially since we have plenty to talk about. This year’s results are very impressive in terms of trade, industrial cooperation, and cooperation in the transport sector: there are a lot of new projects. And then we will go over to regional and security issues.
Thanks again for the meeting.
