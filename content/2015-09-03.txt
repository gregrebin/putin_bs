Meeting with President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, good afternoon,
I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet and to see you in such lively spirits. I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations.
Last year our trade has gone down significantly, but this year it has grown by more than 25 percent. We do need to analyse the reasons for this and what has to be done to ensure smooth work. Besides, I would like to discuss our joint plans on the international arena.
In a word, we do have things to discuss. It is a pleasure to welcome you here.
President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro
(retranslated): Mr President, it is also a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity to meet with you and thus further strengthen relations between Russia and Venezuela.
Apart from bilateral relations, we will be able to discuss matters that concern the global community and the struggle for peace in general.
Besides, we will be able to consider such an important matter as oil, of course. We will be able to discuss what we can do to stabilise the oil market and stabilise the prices, which would make it possible for us to overcome this protracted market situation characterised by low oil prices. We have some good ideas on how to develop this subject.

Meeting with President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very happy to see you again.
As you know, we highly value your position regarding a fair assessment of our recent history, the tragic times of war, and we fully share your approach that today’s problems need to be resolved by joining efforts rather than turning away from each other.
Therefore, I believe this is what we should focus on today, especially since there is a lot to discuss.
Unfortunately, trade between the Czech Republic and Russia has gone down lately. However, I believe this is also temporary and eventually everything will resume its growth and development.
I am very happy to see you.
President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman
: I would like to take up that subject, Mr President. At the United Nations session in New York I intend to speak on a topic that Mr Lavrov actually first raised – forming an association against terrorists.
I believe we need a unanimous UN Security Council resolution, which would practically copy the unanimous resolution adopted against piracy at sea off the coast of Somali. And what are terrorists? They are a type of pirates.
I believe that we need to set up, based on Article 43 of the UN Charter, international anti-terrorist groups that would not aim to occupy territories the way it was with the United States in Iraq, but would rather aim to eliminate sensitive parts of terrorist organisations, namely the heads of these terrorist organisations. And their training centres, of course, because that is where they train terrorists for terrorist acts in any city, including Russia, including China, including practically all continents (with the exception of the Antarctic – there has been nothing of the kind there yet). My request to you is to support this proposal.

With President of China Xi Jinping at the signing documents ceremony following Russian-Chinese talks.
President of People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): My old friend, President Putin,
I welcome your visit to China to take part in the events in honour of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese people’s victory over Japanese occupants and in World War II. I would like to begin by thanking you once again for the warm welcome I was given during my visit to attend the events dedicated to the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, and in July, when I took part in the 7thBRICS
summit and the 15thSCO
summit.
This year we jointly organised gala events dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the victory in World War II. Our countries were the main location of World War II combat in Europe and Asia, bore the greatest losses and made a significant contribution to the final victory in World War II.
China and Russia, as victors in World War II, UN Security Council permanent members and two great Eurasian states bear a serious responsibility for peace in the region and the world at large. It should be highlighted that we both took part in the events organised by both the Chinese and the Russian sides, which in itself is a significant contribution to peace in the region and the world and a positive contribution to the cause of peace and the development of humanity. You have a good tradition in your country to hold gala events to mark the Victory in Great Patriotic War. This year we are holding similar events; this is a kind of innovation.
As time passes, some young people grow less knowledgeable about the history of World War II, some begin to forget it, while certain international forces are trying to falsify it, to rewrite history. In this regard, our views and positions are absolutely identical. We are developing close strategic cooperation and are hoping for it to become even closer.
Good bilateral relations are the main foundation for the close cooperation we are developing. Under our leadership, there has been progress in all areas of cooperation, and more than 30 agreements have been signed in our presence. This is visible proof of your visit’s success. China’s policy to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with Russia and expand investment cooperation remains unchanged.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: My Friend, President Xi Jinping, our Chinese colleagues and friends,
On behalf of the Russian delegation I want to thank you for the invitation to take part in the events to celebrate China’s Victory over militarist Japan and Victory in World War II.

It is noteworthy that for the first time in history, a Chinese People’s Army unit took part in the parade on Red Square on May 9 this year, while a Russian army unit for the first time took part in the military parade in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
You have just said that we are united by our strategic relations and, as we say, relations of a comprehensive partnership. However, our views regarding historical issues also matter. It is true that we should not forget how cruel the occupants were on the occupied territories, what enormous losses this brought to the Russian people, then Soviet people, and to the Chinese people. We have to remember this to make sure that nothing of this kind ever happens again in the future. I listened carefully to your speech at the parade. I believe that this was your main message, addressed to the people of China and the peoples of the world, namely that we should do everything possible to prevent large-scale military conflicts in the future and keep all armed conflicts to a minimum.
I must say that we highly value the level of relations that Russia and China have reached lately. We will have time to discuss the problems we do have, though they were not unexpected. China remains a major trade and economic partner for Russia. We see the turbulence in the world and in our economies and we are prepared for it.
We have already had an exchange during our meeting today. We are fully confident that we will move ahead consistently, developing our relations and implementing all our plans, including major projects that will definitely have a positive impact on the development of the Russian and Chinese economies and global economy as a whole.
Thank you very much for your invitation.

With President of Laos Choummaly Sayasone.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, it is a pleasure to see you again.
Our meeting is taking place as we approach an important event: on October 7, we will be marking 55 years since the re-establishment of diplomatic relations.
Laos will assume the chairmanship of ASEAN, which is very important for Russia in terms of restoring and expanding our contacts in Asia.
Our political dialogue has reached a high level and acquired good dynamics. We should make use of this to expand our trade and economic ties as well.
I am very happy to see you, Mr President.
President of Laos Choummaly Sayasone
(retranslated): It is a pleasure to see you again.
Last time we met when I was visiting Russia in 2011, and the meeting took place in a very friendly atmosphere.
The government of Laos intends to further develop friendly relations with Russia building on the experience we have acquired over the years. This applies equally to the development of economic and investment cooperation, to cooperation in education and tourism, as well as military cooperation, and in the sphere of military technology.
