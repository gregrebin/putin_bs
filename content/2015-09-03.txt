Meeting with President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, good afternoon,
I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet and to see you in such lively spirits. I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations.
Last year our trade has gone down significantly, but this year it has grown by more than 25 percent. We do need to analyse the reasons for this and what has to be done to ensure smooth work. Besides, I would like to discuss our joint plans on the international arena.
In a word, we do have things to discuss. It is a pleasure to welcome you here.
President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro
(retranslated): Mr President, it is also a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity to meet with you and thus further strengthen relations between Russia and Venezuela.
Apart from bilateral relations, we will be able to discuss matters that concern the global community and the struggle for peace in general.
Besides, we will be able to consider such an important matter as oil, of course. We will be able to discuss what we can do to stabilise the oil market and stabilise the prices, which would make it possible for us to overcome this protracted market situation characterised by low oil prices. We have some good ideas on how to develop this subject.

Meeting with President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very happy to see you again.
As you know, we highly value your position regarding a fair assessment of our recent history, the tragic times of war, and we fully share your approach that today’s problems need to be resolved by joining efforts rather than turning away from each other.
Therefore, I believe this is what we should focus on today, especially since there is a lot to discuss.
Unfortunately, trade between the Czech Republic and Russia has gone down lately. However, I believe this is also temporary and eventually everything will resume its growth and development.
I am very happy to see you.
President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman
: I would like to take up that subject, Mr President. At the United Nations session in New York I intend to speak on a topic that Mr Lavrov actually first raised – forming an association against terrorists.
I believe we need a unanimous UN Security Council resolution, which would practically copy the unanimous resolution adopted against piracy at sea off the coast of Somali. And what are terrorists? They are a type of pirates.
I believe that we need to set up, based on Article 43 of the UN Charter, international anti-terrorist groups that would not aim to occupy territories the way it was with the United States in Iraq, but would rather aim to eliminate sensitive parts of terrorist organisations, namely the heads of these terrorist organisations. And their training centres, of course, because that is where they train terrorists for terrorist acts in any city, including Russia, including China, including practically all continents (with the exception of the Antarctic – there has been nothing of the kind there yet). My request to you is to support this proposal.
