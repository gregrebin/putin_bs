Meeting with Georgy Poltavchenko and Alexander Beglov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Poltavchenko,
I would like to begin with you as you are St Petersburg Governor. You have been working in this post for seven years, during which the city has changed, and changed for the better. It is developing. You have been working for the prosperity of the people who live in St Petersburg.
The city is large, there are many problems, and it is always the top official that is responsible for everything. Of course, there are still many issues to be resolved, but many things have changed over these years, and I would like to thank you for that.
I would like to offer you a job at a national level. You know what attention we are paying to the development of shipbuilding today, and in this sense I would like to note that St Petersburg has originally and historically been a centre of Russian shipbuilding. I would like to ask you to become chairman of the board of the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC).
Georgy Poltavchenko: Mr President, thank you for this high level of trust. Thank you for praising my modest efforts.
It is true that I did my utmost to serve the city faithfully for seven years. We succeeded in some areas and perhaps not so much in other. But I always tried to do my best and I think your praise means that I have met your expectations and those of the people who live in St Petersburg, our townsmen.
Georgy Poltavchenko (right) and Alexander Beglov.
Of course, the proposal you have made is a very high-level task for me. The main thing is, as you know, that I have great desire to serve, because St Petersburg is a naval city in all respects.
Our shipbuilding industry was born here, and this is where the leading Russian shipbuilding companies work today. In my line of work I have met with their representatives and know the situation at the enterprises.
I will not let you down, Mr President. Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Poltavchenko, there are many questions. We are speaking, of course, not only about the development of the shipbuilding cluster in St Petersburg but the development of shipbuilding as an industry.
This corporation does not include all the enterprises of the national shipbuilding industry, but it is definitely one of the leaders in the sector.
We have to further boost shipbuilding in Kaliningrad, the Volga region, and also the Far East. We have many spheres of activity, and one of the key tasks is switching from government defence orders to building civil ships of different classes, not only luxury liners, although this is what we specialise in; we have to have a broader perspective. I very much count on your experience, knowledge as well as your executive talent that you have demonstrated here, in this extensive field of work, the national shipbuilding industry.
Yet, the job of increasing the defence capacity is still there, and we are not going to cancel it anytime soon, so that involves many issues.
Georgy Poltavchenko: Mr President, I will make every effort to work on this.
Meeting with Georgy Poltavchenko and Alexander Beglov.
The only thing I would like to ask here is that you support us as this is a really massive sector; honestly, there are problems that I had to think through, and I think that they are hard to solve without your help and that of the country’s leadership. I am ready to work 24/7.
Vladimir Putin: There are thousands of people working in the industry, including top class specialists, and of course, we have to constantly pay attention to social matters and wage levels, as well as other social problems that have accumulated in the sector.
There are so many problems you will have to work with. I am always at your disposal, I want you and your colleagues to know this.
We have known each other for a long time now, for many years, and we must use this to solve federal matters.
Georgy Poltavchenko: Thank you very much, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Mr Beglov, your whole life is tied to Leningrad, St Petersburg. Am I right in thinking you have been here since 1979? You are a builder and started your career in St Petersburg as a builder. You worked as an installer, am I correct?
Alexander Beglov: High rigger.
Vladimir Putin: High rigger, yes. Here, in St Petersburg, you moved up the ranks and made a career in a good sense of the word. In 2003, you even served as the Acting Governor of St Petersburg in accordance with a presidential executive order. Then, you left office following the election of a new governor, went to Moscow and worked in various positions in the Presidential Executive Office, served as head of the Control Directorate and Presidential aide, then headed an envoy’s office in the Central Federal District, and are now heading the envoy’s office here, in the Northwestern Federal District.
Meeting with Georgy Poltavchenko (right) and Alexander Beglov.
I want you to pay special attention to the key territory not only in the northwest, but throughout Russia, focus on St Petersburg. I would like to appoint you Acting Governor of St Petersburg until September 2019. By September, we will see how the work is going and based on this you will decide what to do next.
Alexander Beglov: Mr President, thank you so much for your faith in me. The city of Leningrad, St Petersburg, is my hometown. Indeed, this is where I started my career as a high rigger and moved up through the ranks in the construction industry. Then, I started working at the Leningrad Municipal Executive Committee, and then you entrusted me with the post of the governor. I think I met your expectations then, and everything that had to be done was done in order to get the city ready for the winter, which was a tall order back then.
So, thank you, I will definitely do my very best to be up to the job. For my part, I would also like to not only live up to your expectations, but, of course, to earn respect and trust of the Leningrad, or St Petersburg, residents. This is important for me, because this is my home, the home of my family as well as my friends, my children are growing up here, and all my friends are here. This is my hometown.
Vladimir Putin: Of course, you are aware of the situation in St Petersburg as head of the envoy’s office in the Northwestern Federal District. However, St Petersburg is a special administrative unit. It is more than just an administrative unit – it is a megapolis with five million residents with all its advantages and complexities. Of course, being an envoy, you may have not had the chance to get into all the details, but you are on good terms with Mr Poltavchenko. I hope he will take time to get you up to speed and share with you, as the highest St Petersburg official, the points that need special attention. I hope the transition will be smooth and nothing will be left out.
Alexander Beglov (left) and Georgy Poltavchenko.
I am counting on your knowledge and your expertise and wish you good luck.
Alexander Beglov: Thank you very much, Mr President. I am aware that you love our city, and I have witnessed this during all these years when you helped it build the ring road, start new construction projects, build protective structures, and many other things.
The people of Leningrad, the residents of St Petersburg have a lot of respect for you, and the fact that you offered this position to me is also a credit of trust on behalf of St Petersburg residents. I will do my best not to let you or the people down.
Vladimir Putin: Once again, I wish you every success in serving our hometown and the people of St Petersburg.
Alexander Beglov: Thank you.

Meeting with Mikhail Razvozhayev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Razvozhayev, you worked in the Krasnoyarsk Region before, didn’t you?
Mikhail Razvozhayev: In Krasnoyarsk, yes.

Mikhail Razvozhayev appointed Acting Head of Khakassia
October 3, 2018
Vladimir Putin: And in Krasnoyarsk, you worked your way up to Deputy Head of Krasnoyarsk Region Governor’s administration.
Mikhail Razvozhayev: That is correct.
Vladimir Putin: I have an unusual request and an unusual assignment for you.
Head of the Republic of Khakassia Viktor Zimin recently resigned: this is understandable as he withdrew from the election campaign. But you know Siberia, night temperatures have already dropped below zero and we need to complete the preparations for the winter. We must not lose sight of the region’s social problems even for a day. There are a lot of matters requiring constant attention – and not just attention, but management for these difficult, complex processes.
That is why my request is that you leave for Khakassia, work there for a month, take the situation in the republic under control, including the socioeconomic problems, and help the region conduct honest and transparent election in accordance with our country’s laws.
After that – I have already considered this, and I promise to do this – I will get you back to Moscow and, without a doubt, will find a post for you in the federal government – you are currently serving as deputy federal minister – in accordance with your knowledge, experience and, in a positive sense of that word, your ambitions.
Mikhail Razvozhayev: Mr President, thank you for your trust. I am ready for this task, and I will do everything in my power to make this month the month of efficient work.
Moreover, we are now in the middle of forming the budget and the federal national projects’ regional segments. We need to make sure the republic is part of these projects; we cannot let it miss out, as the participation in these projects will help us resolve all the social matters stipulated in Executive Order No. 204. In 2019, we will need to start carrying out these tasks, so now we have to act on it. This month will be vital for forming the regional segment and working with federal agencies.
Vladimir Putin: This is highly important, because now is the time to coordinate the main areas of focus with the Government, including the areas that require federal budget support and subsidies. You know what I mean.
How long did you work in the Krasnoyarsk Region administration?
Mikhail Razvozhayev: I worked there for over ten years. I also spent four years in Moscow, at the Ministry of North Caucasus Affairs.
Vladimir Putin: I am sure you will do a good job.
Mikhail Razvozhayev: Thank you, Mr President.

Talks with Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria Sebastian Kurz.
The President and the Chancellor discussed the status and development prospects of Russia-Austria relations, topical international and regional problems, and Austria’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018.
After the talks the two heads of state witnessed the signing by Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller and OMV CEO Rainer Seele of a basic agreement on assets sales.
Vladimir Putin and Sebastian Kurz gave a joint news conference.

Beginning of talks with Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal Chancellor, colleagues,
I am delighted to welcome you – this time in Russia, in St Petersburg. The wonderful event, the opening of a joint exhibition by two leading museums in Russia and Austria, gave us a great opportunity to meet once again and to talk not only about art but also about the development of our bilateral ties.
These relations are developing well. Trade is growing. Last year it grew by 40 percent and this year it doubled over the first semester.
The capital investment on both sides is increasing. Russia is actively investing in the Austrian economy. I do not have the exact figures but I think Austria has accumulated over $30 billion in Russian investments.
We are pursuing large projects, but not only in the energy sector but in other spheres as well.
I am glad to have this opportunity to meet with you, Mr Federal Chancellor, and to go over all these subjects, including, of course, international aspects and our relations with the European Union as Austria is now holding the presidency of the EU; to exchange opinions on key matters, most sensitive topics that are drawing our attention in the world.
Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz (retranslated): Mr President,
I have the honour to thank you for this invitation to St Petersburg with all my heart. It is a great joy for me to be here, at the exhibition opening in St Petersburg.
Cultural exchange is not the only important aspect of our relations. We are pleased to see the positive development of our economic cooperation. I am happy with the fact that we are cooperating very well in the energy industry.
Since Austria is currently presiding in the Council of Europe, we also find it important to talk about Russia-EU relations. As you said, today we will speak about some challenging problems such as the situation in Ukraine and Syria. But we hope that in this dialogue we will be able to find an opportunity to strengthen our cooperation as it must be in our interests that the world lives in peace.
I am really delighted to have this opportunity to discuss these and other topics with you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Meeting with finalists of the 2018 Teacher of the Year contest

At the meeting with finalists of the 2018 Teacher of the Year contest.
The President thanked the teachers for their work and wished them further success.
The federal stage of the 2018 Teacher of the Year contest started in St Petersburg on September 24. The jury includes winners of the contest from previous years and administration representatives from teacher training universities. The head of the jury is Rector of Moscow State University Viktor Sadovnichy.
* * *
Meeting with 2018 Teacher of the Year contest finalists
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on becoming finalists of the Teacher of the Year contest. The jury will still need to choose the absolute winner, to put it that way, but this is, actually, a matter of opinion of those who will choose.
On the whole, you certainly showed wonderful qualities, both professional and personal ones. My congratulations on your professional success. This is my first point.
Secondly, as they say on such occasions, I congratulate all of our country’s teachers that you represent on Teachers’ Day, which is tomorrow.
Yours is an important and noble profession, an important, noble mission to bring up children, young people, and raise specialists that our country needs. We all know, and you know better than anyone: a person has to be an active citizen. Each teacher shoulders the responsibility for educating citizens; each teacher, whatever he or she does, whatever subject they teach, also does this. This is absolutely obvious. What is the best way to teach? We all know that – a personal example. Therefore, it is a personal challenge for every teacher, for every educator, to model this kind of behaviour.
But this is also a special burden, and it is always a psychological burden. That is probably why, as I said, this is a mission. Not even a profession, but a mission.
You must know that we have been trying to pay as much attention as possible to this public service area, the most important area – education. Starting next year, we are launching another initiative, a new federal programme, Education, with solid federal funding of over 300 billion rubles for three years. We will build more schools, upgrade the existing ones, supply new equipment and, of course, introduce modern teaching methods, which is a major research field in itself.
When I spoke about a personal example, I certainly had in mind one highly important and difficult component of your work: in order to be able to teach children to learn, you yourselves must learn and study continuously. In the modern world, it is a mandatory requirement for a professional in any industry, and absolutely indispensable in education. As we said at the beginning, personal example is the main thing. When children see their teacher constantly in motion, in development, it certainly cannot go unnoticed.
I want to thank you for your work and to wish you further success. Our schools have achievements; it is absolutely obvious. We can see this at international competitions, where our children win more and more medals, take prestigious awards, even first places. This is certainly the result of our teaching community’s work. How else could it be? This is the only reason. These things do not appear out of thin air. Neither do they dissolve into nowhere. The energy of development has its sustainable source – your work.
Please accept my warmest greetings on the upcoming Teacher’s Day.

Opening of the Imperial Capitals: St Petersburg – Vienna. Masterpieces of Museum Collections art exhibition. With Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz.
The two heads of state took part in the opening of the Imperial Capitals: St Petersburg – Vienna. Masterpieces of Museum Collections art exhibition by the State Hermitage and the Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum.
Visiting the museum included the ceremony of passing the baton of the Field Marshal of the Russian Empire over to the State Hermitage collection. Hermitage Director Mikhail Piotrovsky accepted the baton placed inside a glass box. The ceremony took place in the Field Marshals’ Hall. The gold baton, a symbolic decoration of field marshals and marshals, is studded with diamonds, sapphires and enamel. It was made by St Petersburg jeweller Julius Keibel for Emperor Alexander II in 1878.

Speeches at the opening of the Imperial Capitals: St Petersburg – Vienna. Masterpieces of Museum Collections exhibition
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal Chancellor, friends,
I am happy to greet you at the State Hermitage Museum for the opening of the exhibition Imperial Capitals: St Petersburg – Vienna. Masterpieces of Museum Collections.
Several months ago we already presented it in Vienna together with the Chancellor of Austria. It sparked the lively interest of both connoisseurs and art experts and all art lovers. Now the exhibition has arrived here, in Russia, in St Petersburg.
Visiting the State Hermitage. With Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz and director of the State Hermitage Mikhail Piotrovsky (right).
This outstanding and original project is an eloquent expression of the strong historical and cultural bonds between the two countries, and especially between the beautiful cities of St Petersburg and Vienna. As capitals of great empires and Europe’s architectural pearls, they represent a rich mixture of styles, cultures and traditions. The exhibition opens with the grand portraits of Empress Catherine the Great and Maria Theresia, the great women of the 18th century, who laid the foundation for the Hermitage and the Vienna Museum collections.
St Petersburg residents and visitors will have a chance to see works by prominent artists, including geniuses like Botticelli, Rembrandt and van Dyck. I strongly believe that works by masters of the Northern Renaissance who are not represented in the collection of the Hermitage Museum will be of special interest to museum goers.
Let me point out that Russian and Austrian experts have a long track record when it comes to joint projects and assisting each other in holding cultural events. It has become a good tradition for us to hold cross years devoted to specific topics. Not that long ago we held a Year of Tourism. It was a very meaningful and effective initiative. The Year of Music is underway, and 2019 will be dedicated to youth exchanges.
Let me emphasise that cultural and humanitarian ties and the rich experience we have accumulated in this field provide a solid foundation for our bilateral relations. Russia values the level of cooperation that has been achieved between our countries. It goes without saying that initiatives like this exhibition contribute to further expanding our cooperation in significant ways, enrich our bilateral dialogue, as well as facilitate people-to-people contacts, which is especially important.
Visiting the State Hermitage. With Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz.
I am confident that this exhibition will arouse as much interest in Russia as it did in Austria, and will strengthen friendship and mutual understanding between the peoples of our countries.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all who took part in preparing this remarkable project (our guest, His Excellency Federal Chancellor, has just seen the notice in the hall nearby), especially Russia’s Gazprom and Austria’s OMV, and congratulate them on 50 years of cooperation between Russia and Austria in the gas sector. I hope that this exhibition becomes a memorable and inspiring experience for all its visitors.
Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much.
Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria Sebastian Kurz (retranslated): Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Putin,
Let me express my sincere gratitude for inviting me to St Petersburg. It is a great honour for me to be here today and to open this exhibition together with you.
Art in all its forms is a common language of our people, and the remarkable masters we can see here today has been inspiring and made a great impression on the people of Russia and Austria for centuries.
I am also very glad that the exhibition we opened together with President of Austria Van der Bellen in Vienna is also opening in St Petersburg today.
The 14 pairs of pictures that we will see at this exhibition are not only united by three hundred years but by 2,000 km. They are witnesses of our joint history.
There are also some parallels between art and politics.
On the one hand, these pairs of pictures have a dialogue with each other; they are placed on opposite sides. The same is happening in political relations.
Visiting the State Hermitage. With Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz.
On the other hand, art is based on openness and honesty regardless of the era. Art has always served as a mirror of the people and the authorities. This may be pleasant but also uncomfortable and critical – depending on where you are now. But this honesty, which can sometimes be provocative, helps us all pose a question about the status quo. Like in art, we need this honesty in political dialogue.
In this sense, I am very happy that despite our different views, we can always have a dialogue; we meet with openness and honesty.
I would like to thank Gazprom and OMV who work together very well as companies but, above all, helped to organise this joint exhibition in St Petersburg and Vienna.
I would also like to thank the organisers: directors who have organised this exhibition as well as the director of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.
Thank you very much.
Director of the State Hermitage Mikhail Piotrovsky: Mr President, Mr Chancellor,
On behalf of my colleagues in Vienna and St Petersburg we would like to thank you for attending this magnificent exhibition for the second time (it is a bit different at the Hermitage), thus proving that you believe in what we always speak about: that art is a beautiful bridge uniting people.
Visiting the State Hermitage. With Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz.
I would like to thank my colleagues in Vienna, at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and at the Hermitage for their excellent work. It is not just a good exhibition, but a remarkable example of joint efforts, and this is not always that simple between those who work with art.
I would also like to thank the business community, because this is where the idea was born: with our colleagues and Russian and Austrian friends. Usually we go to business leaders and say: “It’s a fine exhibition, please help.” This time the idea did not come from us, and we acknowledge this, but it is fantastic and complies with the spirit of the dialogue as well as the artistic dialogue that our museums have.
Thank you very much. Please visit the next exhibition we are thinking about.

News conference following talks with Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz
October 3, 2018
22:00
St Petersburg
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen,
We are delighted to have this opportunity to meet with Mr Kurz in St Petersburg. It is already the second visit for the Chancellor, and our fourth meeting this year.
There is no doubt that intensive contacts at the highest political level create the business-like atmosphere we need to promote the relations between our countries in all spheres.
Mr Kurz and I have just held bilateral talks in a business-like and constructive atmosphere. As you have seen, before this meeting we attended the opening of the exhibition titled Imperial Capitals: St Petersburg – Vienna. Masterpieces of Museum Collections here at the Hermitage. Cultural and humanitarian contacts are one of the foundations for our bilateral relations alongside contacts on the inter-parliamentary, inter-regional and civil society tracks.
At the talks, we paid special attention to economic matters. Russia and Austria are reliable trade partners. Despite the current uncertainty in terms of international politics and economy, Russian and Austria have seen positive momentum in their trade and investment ties. Trade was up 40 percent to $4.1 billion in 2017, and almost doubled in the first seven months of 2018.
Austria has become a top importer of Russian goods among EU countries, while Russia ranks second in terms of investment in Austria. The cumulative investment by Russia in the Austrian economy exceeds $31 billion, while Austria’s investment in the Russian economy stands at about $6 billion.
Companies from both countries are engaged in joint projects in various spheres. The Russian-Austrian Business Council is very effective. There is also a mixed commission on economic cooperation that had its regular meeting on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in May 2018. By the way, Austria had one of the most high-profile delegations at the forum.
I would like to highlight the long-standing fruitful cooperation between Russia and Austria in the energy sector. Our country is continuously supplying Austria with energy resources; we also supply other European countries via transit through Austria’s territory. Without a doubt, it is one of the key aspects of our cooperation.
As a result of the talks held this July in Vienna, Gazprom and the Austrian oil and gas company OMV signed an agreement on extending the long-term gas supply contracts with Austria to 2040. Another agreement on involving OMV in the development of the Urengoy gas and condensate field, which was signed just now, showcases the strategic nature of this company’s partnership with Gazprom. OMV is also participating in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline construction project. The Russian side welcomes the Austrian Government’s position on supporting this project, which is of great importance to the entire European continent.
We also discussed expanding our trade and industrial cooperation, and commended the progress made in implementing the 2011 Declaration on Partnership for Modernisation. Within the framework of this declaration, a total of 28 joint innovation projects worth 2.8 billion euros are underway.
I would also like to point out one large infrastructure project: the construction of the broad gauge railway between Vienna and Kosice, Slovakia. When this project is completed, volumes of cargo transportation between Europe and Asia via the Trans-Siberian Railway will grow significantly, while the costs for end-users will decrease.
Of course, we also exchanged opinions on a range of issues on the international and regional agenda. We informed our Austrian colleagues of our approaches to resolving Ukraine’s internal crisis – this time, we only exchanged our ideas.
We also discussed the issue of resolving the Syrian crisis. We can see the prospects for revitalising the political process on the basis of the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and the agreements reached within the framework of the Astana Process. This will secure the progress made in the country and create the environment necessary for the restoration of civilian life and the refugees’ returning to their homes.
We would like to point out Austria’s readiness to participate in humanitarian campaigns to support the Syrian people. It is important for the aid to be provided via the channels approved by the legitimate authorities, and for it to extend to all Syrian regions affected by the terrorist aggression and the civil war.
On November 12, Austria will celebrate 100 years since the proclamation of the Republic of Austria. Tomorrow, together with the Federal President of the Republic of Austria and heads of state governments, Mr Kurz will host a ceremony to launch a series of celebrations marking this important date. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warmest greetings to the people of Austria, wishing them happiness, well-being and prosperity.
I would also like to thank Mr Kurz for the meaningful talks that we had today.
Thank you for your attention.

Question (retranslated): My question is about Syria. First, to the President of Russia. You and President Erdogan spoke about an agreement on Idlib. Is this agreement working? Will it be implemented? Can we expect that there will indeed be no major military activity?
Also, a Syria question for the Federal Chancellor of Austria. For several months now, Russia has been encouraging European countries to finance the recovery efforts in Syria. Is Europe ready for this? Under what conditions would Europe be ready to take these steps?
Vladimir Putin: Speaking about the Idlib de-escalation zone, militants from all across Syria were brought there. Unfortunately, there were too many representatives of radical groups, ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and the like.
By the way, we have been witnessing clashes between these groups inside the Idlib zone as well. But we are not concerned about that. We are concerned about the fact that Syrian residential areas, including the second largest city, Aleppo, have recently been subject to more frequent shelling from that zone.
It is even more troubling to us that this zone is a source of attempted attacks on our military facilities, Russian military facilities, including the Khmeimim Airbase, using makeshift but no less dangerous unmanned aircraft. We had to respond and strike the sources of those threats. It was the main issue during the talks with President Erdogan only recently in Sochi during his short working visit to Russia.
During the talks, we had an idea to create a demilitarised zone 15 to 20 km deep in order to heighten the security of the Syrian civil facilities, cities, residential areas and our military base in Khmeimim.
We agreed to create that demilitarised zone 15–20 km deep, which must not include any representatives of any radical groups, including Jabhat al-Nusra, and no heavy weaponry, regardless of its ownership.
I want to inform you – and I have already said this today in Moscow – that we are working in solidarity with our Turkish partners and see that they are taking these agreements very seriously and carrying out their part of the obligations. They are removing or at least facilitating the removal of any radical militants and heavy weaponry from the area. We are doing our part.
We will continue to take joint measures as planned, including joint patrols by the Turkish troops and the Russian military police.
All this would have been impossible without the coordination of such agreements with the Syrian official authorities and without the support of Iran. We are working cooperatively. The work is basically moving in the right direction. I have every reason to believe that we will achieve our goals. And this means that no large-scale hostilities are expected there, so fighting for the sake of fighting is not what we need. We need to achieve certain goals. The tools that we have chosen to achieve these goals are currently working effectively.
The second part of the question was addressed to the Chancellor, but I will allow myself to take two minutes of your time and express my point of view.
I do not know how united Europe will act in relation to rendering assistance to the Syrian population, but, in my opinion, it is necessary to depoliticise this work. You cannot divide the people of Syria depending on where they live. What's the difference anyway in humanitarian approaches when people need help, whether they live in the area controlled by official authorities headed by President Assad, or controlled by some non-systemic opposition, militants or whoever.
You have to agree with me: what difference does it make for us? Do people have to suffer because they live in a particular area controlled by a particular political force? This is the first purely humanitarian consideration.
And now the second point. Europe is extremely interested in refugees returning back home. According to our estimates, in less than a year, around 150,000 have returned home. Now what if we provided assistance, some elementary help together? Such as repairing the sewage system, water supply and drainage, electricity, the infrastructure that would help deliver food, medical products, medicine, I mean creating the conditions so that people can return home and live normal lives. Isn't Europe interested in this?
Yes, I heard my colleagues say: probably those who have fled to Germany and live there on social benefits, they would probably not want to return. It's your business if you want to pay high social benefits to refugees from the Middle East or from Africa. Why should they go home? What they would normally earn is one third of your social benefits.
Ok. Now those people living in camps – there are millions of them in refugee camps in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan – they certainly could have returned home rather than create an additional burden as potential migrants to European countries. In my opinion, this is the simplest consideration. It is plain to see. Let's work together to resolve these not-so-complicated and, by the way, not-so-expensive, but very important problems for specific people.
<…>
Question: Today turns out to be a big energy day: you have just signed important agreements and you have discussed this topic at the Russian Energy Week. In both cases – speaking about Russian-Austrian cooperation and today in Moscow – you mentioned Nord Stream 2. Mr President, you have said that in any case Russia will implement this project alone, but nevertheless you have added that there may be some problems. The threat of primary and secondary sanctions on the project participants – our European partners – is becoming ever more real. Would you say please how big is the risk that the threat of sanctions can slow down this project or even freeze it?
Vladimir Putin: You know, everybody, or at least those who are interested in global energy and international relations, are aware of the sad aftermath of another project: South Stream, when our pipeline should have been built right to the European Union, to Bulgaria.
Let me remind you that our Bulgarian colleagues assured us that they will fight for South Stream until the end, because it complied with their national interests and improved Bulgaria’s geopolitical status as a gas transit country to Europe. The income they would have received would have accounted for about 400–500 million euros per year just because there is a pipeline on their territory.
This will provide them with an opportunity to create several thousand jobs. But in the end Bulgaria, being under external pressure, refused to implement this project. Now they regret this and say that they would like to use TurkStream to get gas. It would be sad if the whole of Europe was like Bulgaria, showing its weakness and inability to defend its national interests. I have spoken about this in detail at the Moscow energy forum today; I do not think there is any need to repeat this here.
But let me assure you that Russia – we have already spoken about this today – has always been, is and, of course, will always be the most reliable provider, because the pipeline system goes reliably right from the primary source on Yamal, in Siberia, and there are no transit risks, and so on, among other reasons.
I have already said that the volume of sales is growing and the exploration in Europe is decreasing. This is inevitable; in fact, there are no other options. Well, there are some, but they are more expensive and they will decrease the general competitiveness of the European economy, if they back out of such a project.
This is why I believe that we all – and we all are interested in implementing such projects – will fight to implement them. Even today, now, this year, we will sell 200 billion to Europe. All pipelines we have are working and the load is almost 100 percent.
But the demand is growing, and will continue to grow. So what, if Europe gets gas from other regions, including the US, paying 30 percent more? Of course, it is possible, but this is stupid, you see, this is a waste of money and decreases their global competitiveness. The final user, citizens and economies, will get a more expensive product, so I hope that common sense will give all of us a boost to implement such projects. We will fight for it. We will see how it will be in practice. I stick to the idea that such projects should be implemented in the interests of the global economy and, first of all, people who live in our countries.
