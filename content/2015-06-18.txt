President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, colleagues, good afternoon. It is a pleasure to meet with you here in Russia, in St Petersburg.
We have enjoyed friendly relations with the Kingdom for a number of years and we highly value these relations.
I would like to note with satisfaction that our trade is growing. Although it is still rather modest in absolute figures, the trend is very good.
As you may know, during my telephone conversation with the King of Saudi Arabia I invited him to visit the Russian Federation. I would like to confirm this invitation and convey my best wishes to His Majesty.
Welcome.
Deputy Crown Prince, Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia Muhammad bin Salman Al Saud (retranslated): I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with you for the second time. I have the honour of conveying to you the greetings and best wishes from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and expressing his great respect for your Excellency.
I would like to say that the Custodian of the Two Mosques confirms his acceptance of your invitation. I also have the honour of inviting you to visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
We view Russia as an important state in the modern world. Our relations have a long history. Russia was the first foreign state to recognise Saudi Arabia in 1926. Therefore, we will work to develop bilateral relations in all areas.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
I remember the warm welcome I received in Saudi Arabia during my visit. I accept the invitation with pleasure.
