President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, colleagues, good afternoon. It is a pleasure to meet with you here in Russia, in St Petersburg.
We have enjoyed friendly relations with the Kingdom for a number of years and we highly value these relations.
I would like to note with satisfaction that our trade is growing. Although it is still rather modest in absolute figures, the trend is very good.
As you may know, during my telephone conversation with the King of Saudi Arabia I invited him to visit the Russian Federation. I would like to confirm this invitation and convey my best wishes to His Majesty.
Welcome.
Deputy Crown Prince, Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia Muhammad bin Salman Al Saud (retranslated): I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with you for the second time. I have the honour of conveying to you the greetings and best wishes from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and expressing his great respect for your Excellency.
I would like to say that the Custodian of the Two Mosques confirms his acceptance of your invitation. I also have the honour of inviting you to visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
We view Russia as an important state in the modern world. Our relations have a long history. Russia was the first foreign state to recognise Saudi Arabia in 1926. Therefore, we will work to develop bilateral relations in all areas.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
I remember the warm welcome I received in Saudi Arabia during my visit. I accept the invitation with pleasure.

Meeting with First Vice Premier of the State Council of China Zhang Gaoli.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Zhang Gaoli, friends, allow me to welcome you to St Petersburg.
I would like to begin by saying that the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership is actively developing in all areas.
In May our great friend, Chairman Xi Jinping visited Moscow. I know that June 15 was his birthday. Please convey my best wishes. We will soon be meeting within the framework of the BRICS and SCO summits in Ufa on July 8–10. In addition, as we agreed, I intend to visit Beijing on September 3.
Our economic relations are on the rise. This is largely due to the efforts of the Government of the Russian Federation and the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, and we are grateful to you for that. All our Chinese partners are working with Russia actively and with great interest – we see this and value it highly. Thank you for your decision to come to the St Petersburg Economic Forum as well.
First Vice Premier of the State Council of China Zhang Gaoli
(retranslated): Good afternoon, Mr President, Russian partners and friends.
Mr President, I am very grateful to you for finding the time to meet with me and my delegation despite your very busy schedule. This is a great honour for me to meet and talk with you again. The jacket with the inscription Sila Sibiri [The Power of Siberia] that you gave me last year is even more unforgettable.
Vladimir Putin: You were cold then because you did not come prepared.
Zhang Gaoli: When I returned home, I told President Xi Jinping and many of my friends that Mr Putin is not only a strong-willed man and a powerful leader but also a very friendly and attentive person. I remember as we were standing by the model you asked your colleagues to bring me a jacket. Although I told you I would not be cold, you insisted that I wear the jacket. I still remember the warmth.
Frankly speaking, I have a very busy schedule, but I came here to take part in the St Petersburg Economic Forum for your sake and for the sake of Russia.
First, I would like to convey to you, Mr President, the greetings and best wishes from President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang.
The relationship between you and President Xi Jinping is very close and friendly, and in the past two odd years, you have been maintaining close contacts. Today in the course of our talks and at the meeting of the Commission on Investment Cooperation I told Mr Shuvalov [First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia] that, as far as I know, there is no other foreign leader with whom President Xi Jinping would have such close contacts, such frequent meetings and such understanding.
It is thanks to the personal efforts of the leaders of our two states that Chinese-Russian relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation are developing at such a high level.
Last month President Xi Jinping made another successful visit to Russia to take part in the May 9 celebrations. I watched the television broadcast of the parade on Red Square on numerous occasions, when the Russian Armed Forces and the latest samples of armaments passed before you and President Xi Jinping. Many of our Chinese friends were very excited, and so was I.
President Xi Jinping and you have already set new targets for expanding and deepening our comprehensive strategic partnership. This would give a new powerful impetus to the development of our relations. The purpose of this trip is to implement the agreements between our two countries’ leaders and to prepare for the 20th regular meeting of prime ministers.

Meeting with heads of Russian industrial companies
Within the framework of the 19th St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Vladimir Putin met with the heads of Russian industrial companies.

Meeting with heads of Russian industrial companies.
The meeting was dedicated to the development of small and medium-sized businesses in Russia.

Excerpts from transcript of meeting with heads of Russian industrial companies
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.
We regularly have meetings with business representatives. However, today the group is special. It is a pleasure to meet with those who are in charge of what they call real production. Moreover, I see here both people who built their businesses from scratch in the new conditions and those who began back in Soviet times and managed to retain their teams and their production facilities. In other words, here we have people of different generations and of various experience, but all of you are successful.
I hope this meeting on the sidelines of the economic forum will be a success because, apart from the general discussions that are typical for forums and seminars, it is always interesting to talk to people who are involved in the work themselves, to hear from them whether the economic support measures proposed by the Government and formulated within the Presidential Executive Office work in real life or not.
Therefore, we would like to begin by thanking the organisers of this meeting – the Russian Popular Front, which is hosting this meeting.
Let us begin our work.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: I have already heard from some liberally minded people of the need to reinstate state planning. This is no joke. Obviously, it is impossible to revive the old, Soviet model in modern conditions. However, we should consider some elements of planning, primarily in developing the infrastructure. If we consider the tasks facing the state, there should be some strategic elements pertaining to providing certain benefits to specific territories – and we have some priority development areas that have been granted certain preferences, as well as free economic zones. We need to consider all of this and discuss it, bearing in mind (as we keep saying over and over again) mandatory compliance with macroeconomic parameters and maintaining a balanced budget policy.
When I say ‘balanced’ I mean (I believe you will understand me) that we need to hold back inflation. We cannot squander our reserves; on the contrary, we must consolidate them and take good care of them, treat them like our safety cushion, if we want to have a stable political and social situation in the country. This is in the interests of businesses, of all the industry leaders who are here today, so that we can retain the populations’ income level. All this needs to be carefully analysed and formulated.
We need to do this together. We have already developed a mechanism for joint work. True, it developed through the entrepreneurs’ union. If you would like to suggest any other mechanism – please, go ahead, everyone will only be grateful, I am sure.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: Regarding the ruble exchange rate. First, of course, we are talking in public, on camera; this is all a market area. However, as you have noticed, as soon as the ruble became stronger and the rate dipped below 50 rubles to the dollar, it started gradually growing. An excessive weakening of the national currency has its negative components, as we all know. However, we will continue supporting it for the real sector, especially for those companies that produce for external markets. We will use all the instruments at our disposal, even though these are somewhat insufficient (funds may also be allocated in amounts that do not reach the level that we would like to support our exporters, especially in industrial and high technology production). However, we will continue to do it and I would like everyone to know this. We will improve and build up these instruments. However, regardless of how much we build them up, the exchange rate is more powerful and efficient than budget support, as we all know.
It is generally clear now how, say, the hydrocarbon market will develop if nothing extraordinary happens. The prices will remain in the current range for at least the next year or two, I believe, but we have no way of knowing what will happen after that. However, overall the budget has adapted to the present situation, as well as the real sector of the economy. This is reflected in the currency exchange rate, the rate of the ruble to the dollar and other currencies. Overall, we are satisfied with the situation.
The Central Bank has numerous instruments to regulate the ruble mass in the country, to increase or decrease it and to buy other currencies to renew reserve funds. This, by the way, is what the Central Bank has been doing, more actively at some stages, less at others. Such regulation within market conditions will continue to ensure the interests of our real sector producers.
Concerning your relations with small and medium-sized businesses, I was happy to hear that you can feel the benefits of such work. If you see any problems here, you have to make them known to the corresponding Government agencies and financial institutions. We should all consider how to support this interaction. We must consider support instruments because this is all of great importance. This is what Russia’s overall economic growth will largely depend on.
<…>
Vladimir Putin (answering a question on environmental standards): You know, this is a well-known issue that has long been under discussion. And I personally have always approached the introduction of such standards very carefully, understanding that they are an extra burden on businesses. But we all live in Russia: this is our country, we have no another. We cannot live in one place and have companies working in another; some are trying to do that, but lately, that does not seem to work for all of them, even for those who want to. However, we must think about ourselves, our children, citizens in general, in the broader sense. And naturally, we need to introduce environmental standards. But not only for that reason.
I think we all understand that modern production methods, modern equipment, including eco-friendly equipment, are more effective and more productive. So if we want to develop, if we want our fleet to remain up-to-date, the standards need to be introduced. If they are not justified – to be honest, I’m hearing what you just said for the first time – if they are absolutely oversized, then we simply need to look into it and think it over with experts and get back to this issue. I do not see anything extreme or scary about this. We should not be more Catholic than the Pope, so to speak. But we can look into it.
I don’t know whether it is worth declaring a moratorium [on certain environmental standards]. We might come under a lot of criticism from the part of our citizens. But that does not mean we need to leave things as they are. If this absurdity exists and these demands are clearly inflated, we need to look at this in a simple way. Only in that case, I ask you to present specific suggestions with specific figures.
It even seems strange that it sounds that way, because it appears that we have examined these issues from all sides, there was a battle between those who demanded the introduction of these special standards and those who felt it was too early to do that. I had understood that a compromise had been reached, but based on what I just heard from you, it seems there may still be imbalances.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: Please don’t be angry with me, but we need to end this meeting. Although I feel it was interesting and useful – useful for me and for my colleagues. I hope that it was useful for you as well, that you got additional information. It’s not even a matter of additional information, because you can get it one way or another from open databases, of which there are now many.
I think that what’s more important was for you yourselves to get a sense of how we intend to work in the real sector, to work with you. I think you were able to see that there is not a single topic – I want to stress this, not a single topic that has truly escaped our attention. In other words, in general, we are constantly seeking answers, thinking and working on everything that you have just raised as problematic issues. But certainly, this kind of live contact is highly important. And I regretfully realised that I am hearing certain things for the first time today. One of them was brought up by a colleague, and it turned out to be an exceedingly important issue – a problem that is systemic in nature.
So I hope that this is not our last meeting in this format. We once again thank the Russian Popular Front for this format and this meeting. I want to ask you to finalise specific issues we discussed today with my colleagues, to give them suggestions, present them in writing and provide contact information. I have already agreed with some speakers that they will work with the corresponding departments. And overall, we will try to maintain this format.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

Meeting with Prime Minister of Mongolia Chimed Saikhanbileg
Vladimir Putin met with Prime Minister of Mongolia Chimed Saikhanbileg within the framework of the 19th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.

St Petersburg
With Prime Minister of Mongolia Chimed Saikhanbileg.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, please allow me to warmly welcome you.
Just recently, we had the opportunity and pleasure to speak with the President of Mongolia during his visit to attend the celebrations of Victory in the Great Patriotic War on May 9.
Mongolia is certainly one of our key partners in Asia. We have many joint projects. Granted, the course of events in the global and Russian economy has had an impact on our cooperation, but I am confident that this is temporary.
I am happy for this opportunity to talk with you concerning the full spectrum of our relations.
Prime Minister of Mongolia Chimed Saikhanbileg: Thank you, Mr President.
We say in Mongolia, “If a guest arrives with the rain, he should have an open and kind heart.” I hope that this will be true of me today.
First of all, I want to express my gratitude for this opportunity to participate in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, because this forum, in and of itself, is a platform not just to address the Russian Federation’s economic issues, but those of the entire global community.
I also want to congratulate you on the 70th anniversary of the Great Victory. It was also highly significant for us that representatives from our armed forces participated in the parade on Red Square.
Today’s meeting, which follows your meeting with our President, will provide new momentum for cooperation between our two nations.
Thank you very much.

Meeting with international investor community representatives
In concluding the first day of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum’s work, Vladimir Putin took part in a working dinner with members of the Russian Direct Investment Fund international expert council and international investors.

Working dinner with members of the Russian Direct Investment Fund international expert council and international investors.
Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, friends, good evening.
I am very pleased to welcome you all to St Petersburg on the first day of the International Economic Forum’s work.
Meetings with members of leading global investment and sovereign funds have become the Forum’s wonderful tradition. This is the fifth time we are meeting in this format. Present in this room are investors from Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America. This representation shows that there is still a high level of interest in Russia and the new projects in our nation, despite all the complications in the global economy, politics, and individual markets.
According to last year’s figures, direct foreign investments in the Russian economy constituted nearly $21 billion, based on our Central Bank’s data, and in the last three years, the inflow of capital from foreign strategic investors exceeded $140 billion.
Let me stress that Russia is open to long-term, mutually beneficial partnership. We are set to broaden economic freedoms, create the most comfortable possible conditions for investing in the Russian economy – first and foremost, in infrastructure projects and high value-added manufacturing.
Our absolute priorities include maintaining a balanced, responsible fiscal and monetary policy, generally ensuring predictable macroeconomic conditions for successfully doing business and capital investment growth in the Russian economy.
Our fundamental position is that we don’t want to create any barriers or limitations to the flow of capital. As you recall, we did not resort to such measures even during the period of hardship for the national currency and the increase in capital outflow. Incidentally, the same thing happened in 2008 during the global economic crisis, and this is also happening now.
We will continue to develop contacts with foreign business circles and the investment community. And in this respect, I expect that today, we will have a sincere, trust-based discussion. That is why we have gathered here. Among other things, I would like to hear directly from you about the difficulties you are still facing in Russia, the institutions and instruments you think need to be further developed or activated to expand investment cooperation.
I will note that the Russian Direct Investment Fund plays a significant role in developing this dialogue. Together with its partners, the Fund has already invested over 400 billion rubles in the Russian economy, attracting over $15 billion for long-term partnerships. And this is an indicator of the level of mutual trust between foreign strategic investors and Russian structures.
New record-breakers have appeared within the framework of cooperation through the Fund. One of our Arab friends has already participated in 15 Russian Direct Investment Fund transactions. Over ten projects have been implemented jointly with colleagues from the China Investment Corporation.
Incidentally, the Russian-Chinese Investment Fund was created together with our Chinese partners. It participates in the creation of the Silk Road infrastructure projects. This project, which will be closely integrated with the Eurasian Economic Union, can certainly become a reference one for the entire Eurasian continent.
Finally, I will note that the Russian Direct Investment Fund’s work is not limited to attracting foreign capital or expertise to Russia. The Fund plays a major role in supporting domestic businesses. This mainly concerns export-oriented companies. I am referring to a wide range of mechanisms, from helping with fund raising to introducing products to international markets. In short, a system of comprehensive project support is being built, which significantly reduces investment risks.
In conclusion, ladies and gentleman, I will say the following: all participants in our today’s meeting associate their businesses, their work, and their future plans with the success of their ventures in Russia. I want to wish all of you success in those ventures.
