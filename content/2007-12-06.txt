Vladimir Putin: Semyon Mikhailovich, how is the corporation’s work proceeding?
Semyon Vainshtok: I can tell you already that we have set up a company-wide corporate device within the corporation and we have already held two observational councils at which we adopted the corresponding provisions that will allow the corporation to start its work. Today the corporation is ready to start. Things are just beginning but the collective’s work is picking up speed. We have already begun.
Today we are working with foreign architects and with our contracting institutions. We are looking at what has already been done, how work is progressing, and taking into account the demands you expressed on 27 September 2007 [at a meeting with International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge and the IOC members]. As such, we are making ever effort to ensure that no resident of Sochi is disturbed by preparations for the Olympics.
Vladimir Putin: We must ensure that other similar issues are not simply resolved on the sly– neither by the local, regional nor federal authorities. Everything designed to prepare for the Olympics must be done by paying all due attention to citizens’ legitimate demands.
Semyon Vainshtok: With regards to the technology required for this work, we are looking at an evaluation commission and a supervisory structure for the evaluation commissions so as to avoid any possible abuses. I believe that we will be able to do this.
Your second order regards working with environmental organizations and protecting the environment and we are working on this with the architects. We will pay all due attention to the natural environment.
Vladimir Putin: I very much expect that this will be the case. I am thinking of this in light of your previous experience as president of Transneft, when we decided together to bypass the Baikal [while building the Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]. I remember that it was in large part thanks to your efforts that we found the necessary solutions that allowed us to preserve the Baikal. I think that in conjunction with environmental structures you will find ways to meet the challenges in this sphere.
