President Vladimir Putin: Following the tragedy that took place today in Chechnya, in accordance with article 76 of the republic’s Constitution, you will be acting head of the administration until new presidential elections are held. I ask you to organise the work in due fashion. The bodies of power and management have already been formed in Chechnya. All that is important now is that today’s tragedy not have a negative impact on people’s lives. I know that you have good relations with the security and law enforcement representatives. This cooperation will have to continue in order to ensure normal life in Chechnya.
Sergei Abramov: Vladimir Vladimirovich, despite even today’s tragic events, work in the republic has not stopped for a second and will not stop. The President of Chechnya Akhmat Khadji Kadyrov was unable to complete the work he began. I assure you that all the citizens of Russia and the residents of Chechnya, with my help and the help of the ministers who are all working now, will see our plans through to their conclusion. You can be certain of this. We had plans and I can assure you that we will carry out all these plans.
