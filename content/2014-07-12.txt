Cooperation between law enforcement agencies of the two countries was also considered.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, thank you for your invitation.
I would like to congratulate you on the upcoming 35th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution, which, I know, is a very special event for you. We have very warm relations with your country that have a long history. We have always admired both your personal courage and the courage of your people.
Nicaragua is an important partner for Russia in Latin America. This is a special year for us: we will celebrate 70 years of diplomatic relations later this year. Naturally, we have a lot to do to develop our relations further, especially economic ties. However, the basis is very good. Thank you.
President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega (retranslated): Dear Vladimir, esteemed Mr President,
We are very happy to see you here. This is an honour for us. This is a historic visit. It is like a ray of light, like a flash of lightning. This is the first time a Russian President visits Nicaragua. We are very happy to welcome you in our country. Please consider it your country.
We are dedicated to the struggle for peace; we are actively fighting poverty and working to raise the standard of living. We are combatting drug trafficking, organised crime and terrorism. Our cooperation with your people follows a very busy agenda. We see that this cooperation is being enhanced step by step.
We saw some buses on our way to the airport. They were supplied to Nicaragua by the Russian Government. Now Nicaraguans use these buses to go to work and return home. I believe that the most successful cooperation is the kind that enhances the everyday lives of ordinary people.
Our relations are brotherly in nature. This is very important, especially now, when we need to join efforts in the struggle for peace. We accept and support the initiatives put forth by Russia in the interests of peace and are ready to take part in them, and are already doing so. We are ready to support initiatives aimed at establishing peace in the whole world, and especially those aimed at peace in your region within the framework of the conflicts that exist there now.
The resolution of a conflict is not facilitated by bombing or artillery fire. The resolution of a conflict requires good judgement and a sensible approach. The main and most important thing is to take into consideration the will of the people, and that is being done.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
