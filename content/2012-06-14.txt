The President stressed the need to substantially increase the capabilities of strategic, military, and military transport aircraft to address the challenges they face, including outside the country as part of allied operations. Mr Putin also stressed that defence companies must fulfil the state defence order with due quality, on time and at economically sound prices.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
We are beginning an essential part of today’s meeting. As you recall, almost everyone in this room (with few exceptions) worked to organise and hold various meetings last year on preparing branches of the military-industrial complex to fulfil the state armament programme through 2020, and we covered nearly all the branches in great detail. We discussed and analysed their preparedness to fulfil the programme. As a result of this work, a plan was drafted to modernize the military industrial complex at a total cost of nearly three trillion rubles [$100 billion]. Now, the Government of the Russian Federation must make sure that this plan is carried out.
Today’s meeting opens a new series of meetings. At each of these meetings, we will analyse how the implementation of the state armament programme is progressing in all the most important aspects, we will discuss what has been done, what was not done and for what reasons, and we will review the timeframes, quality and prices of the goods produced for the state defence order.
Today we are holding our first such meeting and we will analyse how the state armament programme is being implemented to provide the Army and Navy with aircraft. Present here are the senior officials of the Defence Ministry and military-industrial complex representatives. I expect that our conversation will be specific and results-oriented. We must examine all of our problems in detail, including cooperation and relations between the customer – the Defence Ministry – and the suppliers in all key areas pertaining to aviation technology.
I should note straight away that our modernisation plans for the Armed Forces include a special priority position for aviation. The share of air forces within the Armed Forces will grow. This approach fully corresponds to the development trends in modern military doctrine; experience from local conflicts in recent years also speaks to this. You know that the role of aviation in armed combat is increasing. We can see that aviation systems play a decisive role in achieving military success: strike force, reconnaissance, and transport aircraft. Thus, it is imperative for us to significantly increase the battle capacity of our strategic, army, and military transport aviation, so that the Air Force can be guaranteed to resolve the challenges before it, including outside the Russian Federation – for example, in cases when we are fulfilling obligations to our allies.
We will be bolstering the aviation of the Armed Forces qualitatively and quantitatively by 2020. I already stated at a meeting with flight crews of the military base we are visiting, that we are planning to budget over four trillion rubles [$130 billion] toward these goals, while a bit under three trillion (some 2.9 trillion) rubles for the entire military-industrial complex. But aviation, the state armaments procurement for aviation needs, will get more than four trillion. As you see, it accounts for almost one quarter of expenditures within the entire state defence procurements.
Here are some other matters that I find particularly important and would like to draw your attention to.
First is the leng-term development of the aerial component of the Strategic Nuclear Forces. This will include advancing the development of the new generation long-range aircraft. I know how expensive and difficult this is; and we spoke about it many times with the Defence Minister and the Chief of the General Staff. This challenge is ambitious from a research and technology standpoint, but we are to launch this work. If we do not start it in a timely manner – I am referring to the timeframe for accomplishing separate components of this programme – then we may miss our chance, because we cannot keep using and upgrading existing technologies forever.
It is nevertheless imperative to modernise our strategic Tu-160 and Tu-195MS missile carriers. Incidentally, we have already introduced a new airborne long-range cruise missile to arm the warcraft.
Second, the tactical component of the Air Force will also require serious renewal. Here, I will note the modernization of the Su-25SM fighters, the delivery of new frontline Su-34 strike aircraft, and of course the fifth generation frontline fighter aircraft. Besides, in the next five years, we should implement the A-100 early radar warning aircraft project.
Third, we should very actively develop unpiloted aircraft programmes. According to experts’ recommendations, this is the most important direction in aviation development. Here, we need the full line, including automated strike aircraft, reconnaissance drones and other systems. As you know, unpiloted aircraft are being used more and more actively in armed conflicts. And I must say, they are being used effectively. It is imperative to involve best engineering and science bureaus and centres in this effort, to review opportunities for international cooperation, to accumulate R&D capacities and production facilities. And the necessary resources have been allotted for the purpose: over 400 billion rubles are allocated toward this purpose through 2020.
Let me draw your attention to the fact that we can and should use know-how from our foreign partners; but keep in mind that nobody will give us the most advanced, leading technologies. We must design them on our own, using what we already have, but we must do it ourselves. I repeat, there should be full use of everything we have at our disposition, as well as of whatever foreign technologies available; we are to take advantage of it, but we must break new ground of our own as well.
The military has already begun to receive new airplanes and helicopters. We have now supplied 30 aviation squadrons with fully modern military technology of improved battle features. By the way, new warcraft are being supplied here, to the units of the 393rd Air Force base of the Southern Military District.
Overall, by 2020, we plan to increase the share of modern aviation technology in our military to 70 percent. As I said at our previous meeting, which was devoted to the 100th anniversary of Russian Air Force, over 600 new airplanes and 1,000 new helicopters should be delivered to the military units in the nearest future, and that’s not including the upgraded systems. Serious attention will be given to modernising airfield infrastructure as well. Over the last four years we have brought about seven new modernised airfields into operation per year – 28 in four years – and another nine airfields are being renovated now in Severomorsk, Chkalovsky, Engels, Aktyubinsk, Krymsk, Yeysk, Lipetsk, Chkalovsk in Kaliningrad Region, and Korenovsk. Within the framework of their modernisation, contracts have already been signed worth over 40 billion rubles [$1.3 billion]. The work is underway, and I hope that it will be fulfilled on time, with high-quality results.
The large-scale production of aviation equipment is a serious challenge for Russia’s military-industrial complex. We will have to renew and expand the capacity of defence and aviation companies. I already said it at the beginning of my speech and we discussed this in detail last year: I hope that everything we agreed upon will be fulfilled. We need to modernise the factories producing new materials and aircraft components, including radio-electronic facilities. We will need to build the entire technological cooperation chain. The Government will provide the necessary support to our industrial and engineering companies.
That said, the demands will be strict: we expect proper execution of contracts. The deadlines, delivery scopes, quality and reasonable prices should all the ensured. When I refer to sound prices, I do mean that profitability for suppliers should also be taken into account, and as I discussed it with the Defence Minister, the profits may be as high as 15, 18, or perhaps even 20 percent. Moreover, the Defence Ministry has taken a generally unprecedented step, making 100 percent advance payments in certain cases for some state armaments procurement contracts. But these prices must be justified for the client.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Defence Ministry directly represents the interests of the state. There will be no extra money, no greater funding in excess of what we have allotted through 2020. I have already repeated this a hundred times, but at one of the recent meetings, I once again heard suggestions to increase something. We would be happy to increase the budget, but we do not have the money. Moreover, let me remind you that almost everyone present here participated in the preparation of those drafts and plans, and the prices were agreed upon at the time. Most of these contracts are long-term, and are valid until 2015 to 2018.
I would also like to make note of another mechanism and opportunity. These are long-term contracts that use credit arrangements under state guarantees, allowing companies in this sector the opportunity for steady, stable operation.
Incidentally, aviation technology contracts worth nearly 2.5 billion rubles have already been signed within the framework of the state defence order for 2012.
I would like you to report on the progress in fulfilling the state armaments procurement programme for the Air Force. Please do not just mention the problems. If there are any, I would like to hear specific suggestions on how to resolve them. By the way, all other similar meetings will also have the goal of identifying problems and looking into suggestions to overcome them.

Vladimir Putin presents the Order of Kutuzov to the 393rd Air Force base.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, sergeants, soldiers, veterans,
I congratulate you on a remarkable event: the decoration of the 393rd Air Force base of the Southern Military District with the Order of Kutuzov. You have earned this decoration. You have earned it with your feats of arms, your impeccable fulfilment of the most challenging tasks, and the entire history of your famous unit.
Your unit has been on combat duty serving our Fatherland for the past 60 years. Its victories are truly legendary and heroic. Your predecessors, the pilots of the 807th Assault [Aviation] Regiment, received their baptism of fire at Stalingrad and later routed the enemy on the Taman Peninsula, in the Crimea and the Baltic states, and participated in liberating the city of Russian naval glory, Sevastopol. It was there that the regiment earned its proud name of Sevastopol.

Strike pilots have always fought on the frontline, in the thick of the fight, under enemy fire, where the battle is the hardest, where you need to quickly come to the rescue. That is the task of the army air force, of helicopter pilots. That was true in Afghanistan, where your fellow soldiers fulfilled the most difficult tasks, and during the counter-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus and critical peacekeeping missions.
In the unit’s history, over a thousand military personnel were awarded orders and medals, and 28 of them received the highest awards of our Motherland: the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.
Units such as yours are the backbone and pride of the Russian Army, because we could not imagine our Armed Forces without the continuity of military traditions, without the high morale of the military spirit.
Today I want to reiterate: we will continue our consistent efforts to strengthen the country's defence capabilities, and our most important priority is the development of the Air Force, whose 100th anniversary we are celebrating this year.
The intensity of combat training must increase substantially. You must master modern technology to be supplied to air units, including the Mi-28N and Ka-52 helicopters, which have already come into service at your base.
Our goal is to bring the Armed Forces, the Russian combat air force to a new level, and this nationwide objective will be achieved.
Comrades, you carry out your military service in one of the most challenging and important areas and I am certain that you will always do your duty with honour, fully aware that the sovereignty and security of Russian citizens are in your hands.
Once again I congratulate the air base personnel on receiving the glorious award. I wish you success in your service, health and wellbeing to you and your families.

Beginning of meeting with 393rd Air Force Base personnel
June 14, 2012
16:45
Korenovsk
Meeting with military personnel of the 393rd Air Force base.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
I want to sincerely congratulate your air base once again on being awarded the order.
I am sure you are familiar with the development plans, or at least your commander must know them as he told us just now that the equipment and personnel will be increased significantly, and a full-fledged air force base will be established here, in Southern Russia.
The location is very good; it is situated along one of the key strategic directions and at the same time deep inside Russian territory. The infrastructure is good, and you have excellent core of personnel made up of high-class professionals. That is why we will strive to ensure that such units are established not only in the Air Force but also in other branched of the Armed Forces.
However, all of that is the business of the Defence Ministry and Air Force leadership, whereas I wanted to discuss a different matter with you: I want to ask you about your life and the current problems you face. We have decided to increase the pay and to address housing issues. That is what I would like to talk to you about.

We have repeatedly returned to these issues, and I want to ask whether you receive your pay in full, the increased pay, and how efficiently your housing problems are being addressed, including service housing.
Commander of The 393rd Air Force Base Ryafagat Khabibullin: Comrade Commander-in-Chief,
First, on behalf of the 393rd Air Force Base personnel (Major-General Anatoly Safonov is also present here) I would like to thank you for your high commendation. As commander of the Air Force base, who has served for a long time, I can tell you that, for obvious reasons, we had some outdated equipment. Now we have new equipment, new Mi-8 and Mi-28 helicopters. We have excellent prospects and young flight crews. The base has 48 lieutenants, all of whom have started to fly the Mi-24 and Mi-8 helicopters and will be trained to fly Ka-52s. The army aviation development is progressing successfully.
Vladimir Putin: I wanted to discuss a different issue with you.
As you can see – maybe the officers do not know these people in person, but the commanders must know them – these are CEOs of major Russian aircraft companies. I have gathered them here today to talk about how we will address issues related to the state defence order for aircraft until 2020. I will return to this at the meeting later, but I can give you some preliminary figures already. You must have heard the figure of 20 trillion rubles [over $612 billion], a figure that sounds strange for a normal person, for a normal Russian: that is the total worth of defence contracts until 2020. Of that, over four trillion is expected to be spent on aircraft – nearly a quarter of the funding allocated for the state defence order until 2020. Almost a quarter. Over four trillion.
We are going to re-equip the entire defence industry and we will allocate three trillion rubles for this purpose until 2020, and for aviation, construction, the development of new technology – more than four trillion. Naturally, I cannot say what we will discuss at the meeting, but there will be a lot of new equipment. You will have enough equipment to fly and to serve with.

Meeting on preparations for and holding of the 100th anniversary of Russian Air Force
Vladimir Putin noted that aviation is a key element of the country’s defence and stressed that the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Air Force should be used to boost the morale in military aviation. The President set the task of raising the prestige of the flight, engineering and technical professions, enhancing educational projects and programmes to promote Russian aviation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
In 2012 we will celebrate 100 years of national military aviation. This is an important milestone in the Russian military history and an integral part of our national memory. We must celebrate this anniversary with dignity and respect for the achievements and feats of several generations of pilots, engineers and aircraft manufacturing companies’ workers, who created the glorious heroic annals of the Russian Air Force and those traditions that are today and will remain in the future a solid pillar of the Russian Armed Forces.
I consider it symbolic that we are holding our meeting at one of the best Air Force bases in the Southern Military District, which was decorated with the Order of Kutuzov today. The history of Russian Air Force is woven out of stories of such famous units and the biographies of talented and courageous people, the true patriots of our country.
Our outstanding designers Sikorsky, Mikoyan, Tupolev, Ilyushin, Mil, Sukhoi and Kamov launched the world-famous brands of planes and helicopters. The most complex elements of aerobatics bear the names of Russian pilots. They set dozens of international records in distance, speed and altitude. The brightest pages of history belong to intercontinental flights, for example, the flight over the North Pole (incidentally, we will be celebrating the 75th anniversary of that flight this year) and other legendary exploits of our pilots, such as Nesterov, Chkalov, Lebedinsky, Pokryshkin and Kozhedub.

Military pilots were the first to be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Only during the Great Patriotic War, the highest title in our homeland was conferred to more than 2,500 pilots; 228 air units and formations became guards units, and 897 were awarded military orders. Military pilots made up the core of the first cosmonaut squadron in our country. And it was a military pilot, Yury Gagarin, who became the first man in space.
Today, the Air Force plays a critical role in national defence and state security. The importance of military aviation in the Armed Forces structure and in increasing Russia’s combat capability will gradually increase in the coming years. By 2020, the Air Force will get more than 600 planes and a thousand helicopters. I have just met with personnel here at the base, and the officers asked me: What is going to happen to aviation? By 2020, the Air Force will get 600 new planes and a thousand helicopters.
Systems with improved combat characteristics have already begun to come into service. Major air bases are being established in the Air Force, such as the one that will be established here, with a strong infrastructure and upgraded airfield network. In the past four years, we have overhauled seven airfields per year, which makes a total of 28.
Accordingly, we will significantly upgrade and expand the capacity of defence aircraft manufacturing companies, provide advanced training for pilots, technicians and engineers, and, what is vitally important, inspire young people to dream about the skies, and raise the prestige of pilots, engineers and technicians. I think this is one of the most important tasks set out in the proposed programme for the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the Russian Air Force.
I would like to highlight a few points in this regard.
First. It is important to set the right tone for the upcoming events, make them interesting for the public, both in Russia and abroad. To achieve this, I believe it is essential to ensure extensive coverage of the anniversary by the Russian mass media, to provide up-to-date and full information on all the ongoing and planned activities to the world's leading information agencies, newspapers, television and radio networks, and online media outlets. International exhibitions and forums should make a major contribution to this effort, starting with MAKS, the traditional and largest Russian air show.
Second. Given the importance of the anniversary, the celebrations programme must be extended to all Russian regions, and I ask you to get regional and local authorities more actively involved in the upcoming events; I also count on the participation of the interested public and youth organisations.
Third. Particular attention should be paid to veterans of military aviation and the aviation industry as a whole, those who defended the skies over our Motherland, created and tested unique equipment. I know that such work is carried out through aviation unions and some NGOs, but I think you will agree that we need to expand this list further.
Fourth. We must provide support for the enthusiasts who study Russian aviation history, do research, painstakingly restore legendary aircraft designs of the past years, work in archives, and restore our heroes’ names to living memory. Such civic, patriotic, active initiatives coming from people’s hearts must receive our support. They bring more good than official and formal events.
Finally, special attention must be paid to educational projects and programmes aimed at popularising the achievements of Russian aviation. Together with the historical component it is vital to show the intellectual, science-based potential of the Russian aircraft industry today and its prospects, to talk more about modern life in the Air Force, the hard, responsible work and the service of our military pilots protecting the skies over Russia.
