Stavropol Territory Governor Vladimir Vladimirov.
According to the Governor, the holiday season is going well. There has been an increase of five percent over six months, which is expected to reach 12 percent by the end of the year, meaning that 200,000 more people will use the resort. Radisson wants to build a large hotel in the centre of Kislovodsk, and 17 health resorts are currently under construction there.
Mr Vladimirov noted that he could not issue permits for large-scale construction projects in the biggest resort cities, such as Kislovodsk, Yessentuki and Pyatigorsk, because the sewage system in the Caucasian Mineral Waters was already operating at full capacity. He suggested, if possible, including Stavropol Territory as a sub-programme for the development of the Caucasian Mineral Waters to increase the export of services. As of today, the number of foreign tourists has reached 87,000.
The discussion also touched upon harvesting in Stavropol Territory: over 96 percent of the harvest has been taken in despite the drought in early June. Dairy and meat production are also increasing, as is the production of cotton.
Mr Vladimirov also asked the President to support the rural development programme, in particular social projects and road construction, as part of the national project.
