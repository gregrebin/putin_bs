President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, veterans,
I sincerely congratulate all of you and your colleagues on your professional holiday, the Russian Interior Ministry’s Internal Troops Day.
I congratulate everyone who has chosen this difficult, highly responsible service: protecting our constitutional foundations and social order, ensuring the security of our citizens and the national interests of our Fatherland.
The internal troops were formed back in 1811, when they were called the Internal Guard Inspectorate at the time. They have always been a reliable support for Russia, having proven their loyalty to their oath and their military duty many times in peace and in wartime.
On this day, we express the warmest words of gratitude to internal troops veterans. You and your comrades in arms have brought yourselves unfading glory in the battles of Moscow and Leningrad, in the partisan movements during the storming of Berlin, and in the summer of 1945, you carried out a truly historic mission: during the legendary Victory Parade, you carried and threw the banners and standards of the defeated Nazi troops onto the cobblestones of the Red Square.
The current generation of internal troops soldiers and officers continues the invaluable traditions of courage and patriotism with honour. Beginning in the 1990s, you had to work through many hot spots, and you always demonstrated a high level of professionalism, endurance and courage.
Today, the Russian Interior Ministry’s internal troops consist of powerful, well-trained and well-equipped sections and units. In recent years, you have done a great deal to neutralise terrorist and extremist threats, doing an excellent job of ensuring public safety during international summits in St Petersburg and Vladivostok, the Winter Olympics in Sochi and the World Summer Universiade in Kazan.
I am confident that you will continue to reliably defend the security of our citizens, carrying out law enforcement objectives professionally and precisely.
Thank you for your faithful service. I wish you good health and success, as well as happiness and wellbeing for your families and loved ones.
