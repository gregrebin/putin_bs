President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon, friends,
Today’s ceremony is taking place on the eve of the Defender of the Fatherland Day, an occasion widely celebrated throughout our country, in practically every family. I take this opportunity to congratulate sincerely all Armed Forces veterans and all of our soldiers and officers serving today and ready to carry out even the most difficult combat missions.
Considering the occasion, let me make special mention among those being decorated today of nuclear cruiser submarine commander Alexei Dmitrov. Under his command his crew has demonstrated on more than one occasion high standards of military professionalism and the best qualities of steadfastness and selflessness. First-rank Captain Dmitrov is receiving the high decoration of Hero of the Russian Federation today. 
Gathered here today are people from all walks of life, people who have achieved success in their lives. Your success is not due to luck, chance, and fortunate turns of circumstance (even if these things do play a part in everyone’s life), but is the result above all of your labour, stubborn effort, and desire to put all of your daily effort into your work. I am sure that everything you do provides an excellent example for your friends and colleagues and indeed for many of our citizens.
Here today we have people who work in the economy, those who are developing our education, cultural figures, people from a wide range of professions. It would take me a long time to list them all. I propose, therefore, that we move straight on to presenting the state decorations.
<…>
Once more, I congratulate you all on the Defender of the Fatherland Day. We always need to defend our homeland, and not only during times of war or great trouble. Each of you is defending our country by doing your job, standing up for your views and your values, promoting our culture, and simply defending our forebears’ legacy and achievements. 
Lyudmila Chursina quoted a line from Anna Akhmatova about storm clouds over the skies of Russia [“That the storm-cloud which broods over Russia may be changed to a nimbus ablaze”]. Of course, we seldom have a cloudless sky quite simply because of our country’s rather cold climate and enormous size. But this does not mean that we face dramatic problems and immense difficulties at this time. 
Certainly, we do have many difficulties. Each of you, every single one of you here today, tries to do what you can to make our life calmer and more comfortable, safer and secure, and quite simply more interesting too, which is something people in the humanities and cultural sphere are doing with success.
It is my sincere hope that this year will also be a successful one for Russia, even as the whole world remains in constant movement, global processes boil away, and economic crises continue. But I am confident that we can handle it all, now and in the future.
We count above all on professionals in this, on everyone who does not waste words but simply gets on with their jobs. You are these professionals. I thank you sincerely for serving our Fatherland.

Speech at gala concert celebrating the Defender of the Fatherland Day
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good evening, comrades and friends,
I congratulate you all on the Defender of the Fatherland Day! Following tradition, February 23 is a day when we honour people whose life is closely tied to the Armed Forces, those who are ready to counter any threats to our security and help our nation day and night with weapons in their hands.
Choosing a military career always elicits feelings of deep, sincere respect in any normal nation. And I would like to once again take this opportunity to thank you for your selfless service, for your devotion to your nation.
This year, we mark a special anniversary in the formation of our nation. Our state has been developing for about eleven centuries and this development has been rich with examples of courage, strength of spirit, bravery, and heroism. Naturally, we must hold sacred the memory of our forefathers’ feats.
”Following tradition, February 23 is a day when we honour people whose life is closely tied to the Armed Forces, those who are ready to counter any threats to our security and help our nation day and night with weapons in their hands.“
On this day, in this hall, I am expressing sincere words of gratitude to veterans of the Great Patriotic War
, to all who fought and who worked behind the lines during this very difficult time. Let’s thank our veterans one more time.
Life on our planet is becoming increasingly complex; there are new threats to our security and instability is on the rise spreading to whole regions. It is also alarming to see that force-based methods are still being used in the world to resolve problems and conflicts.
Thus, given these conditions, any nation must know how to defend itself. For Russia, the largest nation on the planet, having modern and highly efficient Armed Forces is not just a necessity, but a matter of survival.
That is precisely why in all these recent years, we have worked to modernise and improve our Armed Forces, and I feel that we have already reached certain results: not in all areas, but in certain, perhaps the most critical areas.
Our troops have switched to a new management structure, gradually getting rid of ‘non-core’ functions. The state arms programme that will run until 2020 provides for renewing 70 per cent of all types of armaments, and up to 100 per cent for specific types. We have new troops to take up combat duty, including the Aerospace Defence Troops, and new missiles are being deployed.
”Regardless of the weapons we create, it is extremely important to remember that there are people behind all of these processes. So, taking care of those who have chosen the service in the Armed Forces as their primary occupation remains a priority in the development of our state.“
However, regardless of the weapons we create (this is our duty and naturally, we will fulfil everything we have planned), it is extremely important to remember that there are people behind all of these processes. So, taking care of those who have chosen the service in the Armed Forces as their primary occupation remains a priority in the development of our state.
In recent years, I feel we have made progress in this area and created a new system of increasing social guarantees for service members. This involves new military pay and resolving the housing issue. All this should help those who serve in the army to focus on fulfilling their main tasks in combat training; meanwhile, their families should feel comfortable and protected.
Clearly, there is more to be done and much of the work is still ahead of us. I sincerely hope that everyone present here and everyone serving in our Armed Forces will participate in this work.
Comrades, according to tradition, many of you will be celebrating your professional holiday today and tomorrow at your posts. The fact that our Armed Forces are currently capable of resisting any other armed forces, repelling any threat to our national security, gives our country confidence in the future.
Thus, I want to congratulate you on this holiday once more, wish good health to all of you, your loved ones, everyone present here today and everyone currently at their posts.
Happy Defender of the Fatherland Day!

Meeting with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller
Mr Miller briefed Dmitry Medvedev about the progress with the South Stream project and gave an overview of the Russian-Ukrainian gas cooperation.

With Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good evening, Mr Miller.
Gazprom is engaged in some major projects. Some of them have already been put into operation, such as Nord Stream, for example. Construction on other projects is just about to begin (I hope it will start very soon), particularly in the case of South Stream. How do things stand on this project, what are the latest events, what has been done, and what remains to be done?
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller
: Mr President, we have completed the overall feasibility study for this project, which covers the underwater part of the South Stream pipeline as well as its sections in the transit countries in Southeast and Central Europe.
Dmitry Medvedev: Please tell us what they are, since not everybody remembers.
Alexei Miller: They are Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary and Slovenia, with segments to Croatia, the Republic of Serbia and a pipeline to Greece. Today, Gazprom has prepared a new, adjusted schedule after Turkey gave us permission last December to build the pipeline through its exclusive economic zone. We have updated our schedule and will be ready to begin construction in December of this year.
Dmitry Medvedev: Understanding the pipeline construction process, as well as its key parameters like capacity, will be dependent on talks with our Ukrainian partners, because there are different options: we can give it greater capacity or stop at some middle point. How do things stand right now with our Ukrainian friends? What is the status of our gas cooperation talks?
Alexei Miller: Mr President, the issue recently under consideration – the design capacity of the South Stream pipeline – has now become even more relevant in the context of the unusual cold wave in Europe at the beginning of February. In early February, much of Europe had abnormally low temperatures; even the Danube froze, as did the canals of Venice, so our European consumers increased their requests for Russian gas.
For its part, Gazprom did everything necessary to fully satisfy the needs of European consumers. However, a significant volume of gas transiting through Ukraine did not arrive in Europe.
Dmitry Medvedev: Why?
Alexei Miller: On certain days, as much as 40 million cubic metres of gas remained on Ukraine’s territory, and this certainly caused damage to Gazprom’s finances and reputation. At the same time, in this situation, there is no effective mechanism to control the actions of Naftogaz of Ukraine.
Dmitry Medvedev: Do I understand correctly that this means siphoning off gas?
Alexei Miller: Our Ukrainian partners took as much gas from the export pipeline as they felt necessary.
Dmitry Medvedev: In other words, beyond the scope of existing rules and not on the basis of agreements?
Alexei Miller: They took as much gas as they felt necessary; moreover, they took gas intended for European consumers, and our Ukrainian partners knew this. They knew the volume intended for Ukraine, in accordance with the ten-year contract in effect between us.
Dmitry Medvedev: But they did not ask us to increase their volume of supplies during that time?
Alexei Miller: On the contrary, Mr President, at the beginning of this year, our Ukrainian friends had brought up the question of reducing supply volume.
Dmitry Medvedev: Yes, I remember, from 52 billion to 27 billion cubic metres. And nevertheless, during the abnormal cold wave, they took gas.
Alexei Miller: However, during the unusually cold wave, Ukraine was taking gas at the annual pace of over 60 billion cubic metres.
Dmitry Medvedev: I see. Please look into all these instances within the framework of corporate procedures and civil-law agreements between Gazprom and Naftogaz of Ukraine.
For my part, I wanted to say the following in this context. Naturally, we will need to determine the ultimate capacity of the South Stream pipeline. But in making this decision, I would like you to also take into account what happened at the beginning of this year. The situation was the same as in previous years, and overall, I feel it is a sufficient basis for instructing Gazprom to plan for maximum gas flow capacity in designing and building the South Stream pipeline. What was the volume?
Alexei Miller: It was 63 billion cubic metres of gas.
Dmitry Medvedev: We need to make calculations based on the highest figures, because we need to consider the future. Please give instructions to Gazprom entities and everyone involved in preparing the final project documentation. When will construction begin?
Alexei Miller: We will launch the construction in December. All the necessary instructions on gas pipeline design based on a 63 billion cubic metre capacity will be given without delay.
Dmitry Medvedev: Please let our Ukrainian friends know about this position, explain the reasons we are making the corresponding decisions and, of course, continue talks with them on potential gas cooperation, as we discussed with the President of Ukraine recently in Moscow.
Alexei Miller: Very well.
Dmitry Medvedev: Thank you.
