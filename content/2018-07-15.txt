With President of France Emmanuel Macron.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the Kremlin.
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on the holiday France celebrated yesterday – I already sent a message, but now I am happy to do it in person – Bastille Day. And of course, on your team reaching the World Cup final. We will be watching the match tonight and I am sure that the game will be intense, exciting and beautiful, and will please millions of fans around the world.
I am certainly glad to have this opportunity to talk about our bilateral relations. In this regard, I would like to note a positive trend in trade and economic sphere: last year’s growth of trade was around 15 percent, while in the first six months of 2018, it is 19 percent.
The large interparliamentary commission is scheduled to meet soon; that is, the usual cooperation mechanisms are gradually being restored. This gives grounds to believe that we will overcome all the difficulties encountered in the previous period, and will embark on the path of positive development of multifaceted ties.
In this regard, I would like to note that your visit as part of the St Petersburg Economic Forum gave a good impetus to the development of our relations.
President of France Emmanuel Macron (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President, for the reception.
I would like to repeat, I am very glad to come here again. Indeed, I made a commitment earlier to come to St Petersburg, from the moment our team makes it to the semi-finals, but today I came here to support my team in the final.
I would like to give credit to your team, which achieved great success, making it so far, and doing it in spite of all the forecasts. They did just great.
I also wanted to congratulate the entire country, the host country of this World Cup, on an excellent organisation of this event, which was followed in all regions of the world, and people from all regions came here. Everything was organised with excellent security; everything was just perfect.
Today's meeting is a good chance to continue our dialogue, the exchange of views we started on May 24 and 25 in St Petersburg. We discussed a series of bilateral issues, as you have already mentioned. We also discussed a number of international and regional issues as we often do, first of all, the situation in Syria. We made certain commitments and implemented a number of measures.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, I would like to congratulate you once again on today's event – passing on to you the next World Cup mantle.
The only thing that puzzled me during today's ceremony is your statement that your team is going to repeat the success of the Russian team in this tournament. (Laughter.) Because after the performance our team has shown we will now expect even greater results from them next time. What will happen when our two teams play each other?
But I am sure, and I would like to repeat it, I have known you for a long time, Your Highness. I know that you and all your colleagues, your subjects will make every effort to ensure that the 2022 FIFA World Cup is held at the highest level. We will all prepare for it and will do all we can to support you.
I am certainly glad to use this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations, and to exchange information on the situation in the region.
Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President. I would like to thank you for the ceremony we just attended, for your invitation, and for the opportunity to meet with you.
I would like to assure you that our country will make every effort to prepare the 2022 World Cup. As you know, Mr President, around 200 Qatari specialists, members of the 2022 local organising committee are currently in Russia, working with their Russian counterparts. It is really a terrific experience. I would like to thank you for this opportunity, for the fact that our Russian friends have opened the doors to us.
As I said, I have been talking about this since 2010, we will work to make the 2022 World Cup an excellent tournament, because this event is extremely important for the whole region. As you know, Arab countries are now facing difficulties, and we hope that this event will help us overcome them.
As for the success of our teams, of course, the Russian team has achieved a lot. We will try very hard, although it will be difficult to repeat its success. We are a small country, but we are very fond of sports and we love football.
As you know, athletes are very optimistic people, and after the Russian team made it out of the group, we immediately remembered that two years ago we defeated your team in a friendly match, so we say that we would have gone further. But it was a friendly match, so, naturally, the results are different there.
Allow me once again to thank you for this event and for the whole tournament. Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam President, friends,
Welcome to the Kremlin.
First of all, of course, I would like to congratulate you on the successful performance of your national team at the World Cup.
President of Croatia Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (in Russian): Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I am sure today we will see an interesting and exciting performance as well.
We have made every effort to provide all the necessary conditions for the players, including for your team. I think that our respective national teams played very well during their match – it was wonderful and very impressive, and brought joy to millions of fans.
Madam President, since our last meeting last year, the relations between our countries have been developing very successfully. For the first time since 2014, we observed a positive dynamics of trade growth last year. The same stable growth was observed in the first quarter of this year. Your economy has about $400 million of Russian direct investments. I hope this figure will grow.
We have a lot to talk about. We are very glad to see you.
President of Croatia Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (retranslated): Mr President,
I would like to express heartfelt thanks to you, not only personally and on behalf of the delegation that arrived with me, but also on behalf of all Croatian representatives of the national team, the Croatian team and all Croatian fans who are staying in Russia during the World Cup and feel totally at home.
Before we proceed to considering bilateral issues, I would like to say a couple of words as an avid football fan. I want to congratulate you on this World Cup being an example for the rest of the world of how such events should be organised, because you not only ensured the freedom of movement for football fans but also prevented any incidents or statements that can be seen as hate speech. This is a true example for everyone in the world. I hope that this World Cup will be cherished as such by people.
Mr President, I would like to once again thank you personally for inviting me. This is the third time I have visited Russia, and I would like to thank the receiving side for organising these trips. I feel very much at home here, and I am very pleased about the way I was welcomed in Nizhny Novgorod and Sochi. Our fans and I feel totally at home.
I am very pleased that our formal meeting today begins with a pleasant informal moment ­–­ an anticipation of Croatia's possible victory.
Let us proceed to more serious issues. Our meeting today is taking place at a special time, just between the latest NATO summit and your upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump. This meeting is also taking place amidst important things happening in Russia-Croatia relations.

With President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Welcome to Moscow. I am very glad that you came for the World Cup final match and we have an opportunity to meet and talk.
You have probably already seen the assessments from specialists and athletes. I hope we have managed to duplicate the success of hosting major international sports events, which we demonstrated while organising the Olympic Games in Sochi.
I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you and talk about the interaction between the Russian National Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee.
Welcome.
IOC President Thomas Bach (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President, for this kind welcome. It is a great honour for me to visit Russia to attend the World Cup final.
I would like to offer my sincere congratulations on the immense success of the World Cup. Indeed, Russia has shown once again its ability to host such major events due to its exceptional organising skills.
This is undoubtedly a tremendous success for all Russian people, who have shown that they are warm-hearted and friendly hosts. I think that the warm welcome shown by Russians to foreign guests has perhaps changed many assessments that could be heard in various countries, and proved that Russia is indeed a kind and friendly host.
My congratulations.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.

Attending the meeting on the Russian side were Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov, and Healthcare Minister and Co-Chair of the Russian-Hungarian Intergovernmental Commission on Economic Cooperation Veronika Skvortsova.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
Welcome to Moscow.
You have kept your promise and came for the World Cup final. There is nothing surprising about that since we all know you as a good footballer who loves football.
I hope you will enjoy today's match.
Of course, I am glad to have this opportunity to talk to you about some current issues. Our cooperation has been developing successfully. Last year, our mutual trade grew by 25 percent, event slightly more, according to our data. During this year's first three months, it showed the same growth.
As a result, the revenues of our Hungarian partners who work on the Russian market are increasing as well. Our major projects in energy and nuclear power are underway according to plans.
I note with satisfaction that we have diversified cooperation, for instance, in pharmaceutics and engineering. One of your companies has 4 percent of the Russian market in terms of medication deliveries and production. This is a very good indicator.
We have a lot to talk about. I am very glad to see you.
Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban (retranslated): Mr President,
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to be here. My congratulations on the wonderful World Cup and the professional organisation of this event. Those who were unable to attend it should regret it. But I am not my own enemy; I am very glad to be here.
Also, I have had an opportunity, for the first time in my life, to spend two full days in St Petersburg and three days Moscow. This is the first time in my life that I have had this wonderful opportunity. These two cities are diamonds of the European civilisation. I do not quite understand those who are eager to travel from Budapest to visit the Vienna State Opera but do not want to visit the Bolshoi Theatre, which is a gem of European culture. Naturally, both cities made a deep impression on me.
There was also a political aspect to my visit: I left for the NATO Summit straight from St Petersburg.
As regards bilateral relations, we also think that they are progressing well. Thank you, Mr President, for mentioning this. Frankly, if it were not for the sanctions, which are causing damage, we could be advancing even faster. Of course, these measures are harmful, and we are missing many opportunities. I would like to assure you, Mr President, that we support the normalisation of relations between Russia and the West.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your kind words and for your view of Moscow and St Petersburg’s importance for European and world culture. But we know that Hungary has at least two such diamonds: Buda and Pest. There are others as well.

Answers to journalists’ questions after the 2018 World Cup final match.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening.
Question: Mr President, what do you think of the final match? Who did you cheer for? In general, what are your impressions of this football tournament? You probably had no chance to sense the atmosphere in the streets of Russia. Have you been to the now famous Nikolskaya Street? Or maybe the commotion on Red Square could be heard in the Kremlin?
Vladimir Putin: I have to admit that I did see something from the Kremlin windows, but I had no chance to take part in the goings-on. But I kept track of everything that happened, and here is what I want to tell you in this connection.
First, and I already said this yesterday, but I would like to repeat it today, that we can definitely feel proud of how we organised this tournament. As I said many times before, we did it for our fans in Russia and for sports enthusiasts everywhere around the world. And we have done it. We succeeded in all aspects of this huge event.
Today’s match was brilliant. I think you will agree with me. I do not remember, and few other people can remember a score like this, 4–2, in a final match. I am sure that all sports enthusiasts and football fans around the world were trembling with excitement throughout the match. Both teams are wonderful, and they played an open attacking football. I am sure everyone enjoyed that. I did.
I have congratulated President of France Emmanuel Macron and my Croatian colleague. She was very temperamental and, I believe, even shed a tear or two. Yet everyone is happy and glad. Winning the silver medal is a major achievement for the Croatian team, which plays excellent, high quality football, as I see it. We congratulate them on this result.
Question: Which team did you support?
Vladimir Putin: I just enjoyed this amazing football match.
Question: Mr President, what can you say about the performance of the Russian team? After all, this was the first time the team went this far.
Vladimir Putin: Here is what I would like to say about this. I think that millions of people did not expect our team to show this result, no matter what some may be saying now. We can be proud that we have such a wonderful coach, and that he is Russian, and we can be proud of our team.
Of course, unlike art, sport is much more than mere contemplation. Sport is about achieving results. And the result for the Russian team was honourable. What matters most is that we realised that we have football in Russia, that we have a team, that we are about to develop our own style, and that we can strive for even higher results at international tournaments. Our team has proved that this is possible.
What I liked in particular is that the Russian players have shown their grit and played well. They fought to the very end. I think that this is what matters the most. This is something that deserves our gratitude and support. Of course, the result is impressive in itself, since we have not had anything like this for a long time. I think that we must congratulate them and inspire them to strive for future victories.
Question: Will you have a meeting with them?
Vladimir Putin: Yes, there will be a number of meetings, and they have been scheduled, first with the coach, and the captain, who will take part in a meeting of the Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport in Kaliningrad. After that there will definitely be a meeting with the team.
Question: Mr President, how often do you play hockey? Did the World Cup inspire you to play some football? You did play a little bit with Mr Infantino at the Kremlin, and on Red Square.
Vladimir Putin: I think that each and every one of us has played some football, and kicked the ball around. This is not enough, however. What are the reasons that make football so popular? First, when wonderful teams play at a high professional level, it is always fascinating to watch. In addition, we all get a feeling that any one of us can do it. Kicking a ball does not seem all that complicated. That being said, when you actually get into football it becomes a special kind of art. So far I have been playing hockey, and try to improve my game. I learned to skate a little bit, and will move in this direction.
Question: Do you think that the 4–2 score reflects the actual state of play on the pitch?
Vladimir Putin: Yes. We saw one curious goal, but overall the Croatian team also played openly and took risks, but they missed some opportunities, which happens. Overall, the French showed class, no doubt about that.
Question: Do you feel the winner today?
Vladimir Putin: As you may remember, we told you many times that the main goal for Russia is to properly organise the tournament. We have done it; we have achieved this goal, as everyone agrees.
This is what I would like to point out. We often complain about our fans, who sometimes misbehave because they are so emotional. But it turned out that they are also highly responsible people. Frankly, I was surprised, and I am very grateful to them for this. I would like to thank them for the attitude they have inspired towards this sports event. This largely happened thanks to our fans.
We are grateful to the coaches, specialists and the players of our team, who have inspired the fans to see football as a festival. We have succeeded thanks to good organisation. Hundreds if not thousands of volunteers helped us do this in all the host cities. I would like to thank them as well, because it was the volunteers who welcomed our guests, accompanied them and saw them off, doing all this with a smile and an open heart. Everyone has noticed this.
Today I do not want to talk about what was being said before the World Cup. Let us turn this page. Let us talk and think about the good things. We have produced a wonderful holiday thanks to the efforts of thousands of people.
Of course, we must also express gratitude to our guests – foreign tourists and fans. I would like to point out that attempts were made to intimidate us as well: some said the British fans are hooligans, and so on. But everyone behaved wonderfully, demonstrating the best qualities of sports enthusiasts and football fans. They have shown that sports and football do not disunite people or lead to quarrels and fights, but that it can bring people together on the basis of shared principles and values – cultural and humanitarian values.
Many foreigners have learned about our culture and our cities, and they have met our open-hearted people. And millions of people – not thousands but millions – have changed their views on Russia. It is an achievement, a big achievement.
Here is what we will do in this connection – I have discussed this with my foreign colleagues when I congratulated the Croats and the French. We will approve a visa-free entry for foreign holders of Fan IDs until the end of the year. I hope they, or at least many of them will use this opportunity, and that they will come to Russia many times again together with their friends and families.
Thank you, and all the best.

The ceremony took place in the Kremlin's Armorial Hall.
The World Cup final match will take place today, July 15, at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, with France playing against Croatia.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, Mr Infantino, friends,
We are holding a pleasant official event today: Russia is handing over the FIFA World Cup host's mantle to Qatar.
The World Cup in Russia is nearing its end. We are proud of what we have managed to do for all the fans of this wonderful sport. We, the entire country, have immensely enjoyed the world of football and the fans who came to Russia from all over the world.
I am confident that our friends from Qatar will be able to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup at the same high level. Of course, we are ready to share with our friends in Qatar the experience we have gained while hosting this year's World Cup.
We will make every effort for football to implement its wonderful humanitarian mission of uniting people, countries and continents.
Thank you.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino: Mr President, Your Highness, today I am a happy man.
Dear friends, welcome. (In Russian.) Dorogiye druzya, dobro pozhalovat. These are the words which have followed us in the last month and which will follow us in the next four years.
It is so important that we can be here together today in this iconic place, in the Kremlin, to mark a pass of the ball from the organiser of 2018 to the organiser of the 2022 World Cup.
This is football: it is passion, it is emotion, it is love, it is family, it is unity, and these sentiments that we have been feeling here in Russia, we transfer them to Qatar.
And I am sure that the same incredibly energetic and positive impact that football has had in Russia, it will have the same in Qatar four years from now.
So, as far as I am concerned, I can say that we all fell in love with Russia.
(In Russian.) Ya lyublyu Rossiyu. And I am sure that in four years from now, Your Highness, we will all fall in love with Qatar. As far as I am concerned, it has already happened, but we will bring the others on board.
(In Russian.) Spasibo bolshoye.
Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (retranslated): Mr President, first, let me congratulate you and the Russian people on organising a wonderful World Cup.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate you personally on behalf of all football and sports fans on the success and the wonderful World Cup, and we hope to host the tournament in the same way in our country.
I would like to express gratitude to our friends from the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee, who are providing assistance to their colleagues from the Qatar 2022 organising committee. We hope to continue this cooperation with our Russian friends on the issues related to hosting the 2022 World Cup.
I would like to congratulate Mr Infantino and thank him for the efforts taken for the success of the World Cup, and express hope for cooperation until 2022.
Mr President, hosting the 2022 World Cup in our country is an important event. I can remember how our country won the bid back in 2010. It is a great festival for all Arab people. Thank you.
I would like to invite all our friends. We will make every effort to welcome all guests in our country. We hope our national team will duplicate the success of the Russian team and even surpass it. We will do our best.
(In Russian.) Thank you.

Congratulations on Metallurgist’s Day
Vladimir Putin congratulated workers and veterans of mining and smelting enterprises of Russia on their professional holiday – Metallurgist’s Day.
July 15, 2018
09:00
Vladimir Putin congratulated workers and veterans of mining and smelting enterprises of Russia on their professional holiday – Metallurgist’s Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
I congratulate Russia’s mining and metallurgy workers on their professional holiday, Metallurgist’s Day.
The work of a miner, a metallurgist, has always been honourable and enjoyed particular respect. Through the efforts of many generations, industry dynasties – in the Urals and Kuzbass, Eastern Siberia and Northwestern and central Russia – major production complexes have been created, genuine flagships of the domestic industry, which made an enormous contribution to developing industry and infrastructure in the country and equipping Russia’s Army and Navy.
I would like to specifically note the heroic work of miners and metallurgists during the Great Patriotic War. They gave their all to ensure victory and participated in rebuilding plants and factories, cities and small towns, during the post-war period.
Today, the rhythmic, steady work of hundreds of thousands of miners and metallurgists largely determines the dynamics of the Russian economy, makes it possible to implement large-scale infrastructure projects and reliably ensure our country’s defence capability.
Domestic metallurgy products enjoy demand on international markets as well. Our manufacturers are among the world leaders for a number of products, such as large-diameter pipes and sheet steel.
Notably, domestic metallurgy is open to new approaches and advanced technology. Promising deposits are being developed in the industry, major modernisation projects are being launched, and new rolling mills are being put into operation.
We take pride in developing white metallurgy which is unique for our country. Its output, technical solutions and the level of employee training correspond to best international practices.
I am confident that the number of such modern production sites putting out goods with high added value and high export potential will continue to grow.
However, the focus should remain on improving working conditions at enterprises, increasing the incomes of industry workers and improving professional skills.
Of course, much remains to be done to reach the next level of environmental standards and to improve the environment in our country’s industrial cities.
Friends, we have big ambitious goals for metallurgy in Russia. Achieving them will determine the future of the industry and the well-being of its employees for many years to come.
Russian metallurgy has always been famous for its professionals dedicated to their work. I am confident you can handle even the most complex of challenges.
I congratulate you on the occasion and wish you every success and all the best.
