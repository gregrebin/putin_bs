With President of France Emmanuel Macron.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the Kremlin.
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on the holiday France celebrated yesterday – I already sent a message, but now I am happy to do it in person – Bastille Day. And of course, on your team reaching the World Cup final. We will be watching the match tonight and I am sure that the game will be intense, exciting and beautiful, and will please millions of fans around the world.
I am certainly glad to have this opportunity to talk about our bilateral relations. In this regard, I would like to note a positive trend in trade and economic sphere: last year’s growth of trade was around 15 percent, while in the first six months of 2018, it is 19 percent.
The large interparliamentary commission is scheduled to meet soon; that is, the usual cooperation mechanisms are gradually being restored. This gives grounds to believe that we will overcome all the difficulties encountered in the previous period, and will embark on the path of positive development of multifaceted ties.
In this regard, I would like to note that your visit as part of the St Petersburg Economic Forum gave a good impetus to the development of our relations.
President of France Emmanuel Macron (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President, for the reception.
I would like to repeat, I am very glad to come here again. Indeed, I made a commitment earlier to come to St Petersburg, from the moment our team makes it to the semi-finals, but today I came here to support my team in the final.
I would like to give credit to your team, which achieved great success, making it so far, and doing it in spite of all the forecasts. They did just great.
I also wanted to congratulate the entire country, the host country of this World Cup, on an excellent organisation of this event, which was followed in all regions of the world, and people from all regions came here. Everything was organised with excellent security; everything was just perfect.
Today's meeting is a good chance to continue our dialogue, the exchange of views we started on May 24 and 25 in St Petersburg. We discussed a series of bilateral issues, as you have already mentioned. We also discussed a number of international and regional issues as we often do, first of all, the situation in Syria. We made certain commitments and implemented a number of measures.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, I would like to congratulate you once again on today's event – passing on to you the next World Cup mantle.
The only thing that puzzled me during today's ceremony is your statement that your team is going to repeat the success of the Russian team in this tournament. (Laughter.) Because after the performance our team has shown we will now expect even greater results from them next time. What will happen when our two teams play each other?
But I am sure, and I would like to repeat it, I have known you for a long time, Your Highness. I know that you and all your colleagues, your subjects will make every effort to ensure that the 2022 FIFA World Cup is held at the highest level. We will all prepare for it and will do all we can to support you.
I am certainly glad to use this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations, and to exchange information on the situation in the region.
Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President. I would like to thank you for the ceremony we just attended, for your invitation, and for the opportunity to meet with you.
I would like to assure you that our country will make every effort to prepare the 2022 World Cup. As you know, Mr President, around 200 Qatari specialists, members of the 2022 local organising committee are currently in Russia, working with their Russian counterparts. It is really a terrific experience. I would like to thank you for this opportunity, for the fact that our Russian friends have opened the doors to us.
As I said, I have been talking about this since 2010, we will work to make the 2022 World Cup an excellent tournament, because this event is extremely important for the whole region. As you know, Arab countries are now facing difficulties, and we hope that this event will help us overcome them.
As for the success of our teams, of course, the Russian team has achieved a lot. We will try very hard, although it will be difficult to repeat its success. We are a small country, but we are very fond of sports and we love football.
As you know, athletes are very optimistic people, and after the Russian team made it out of the group, we immediately remembered that two years ago we defeated your team in a friendly match, so we say that we would have gone further. But it was a friendly match, so, naturally, the results are different there.
Allow me once again to thank you for this event and for the whole tournament. Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam President, friends,
Welcome to the Kremlin.
First of all, of course, I would like to congratulate you on the successful performance of your national team at the World Cup.
President of Croatia Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (in Russian): Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I am sure today we will see an interesting and exciting performance as well.
We have made every effort to provide all the necessary conditions for the players, including for your team. I think that our respective national teams played very well during their match – it was wonderful and very impressive, and brought joy to millions of fans.
Madam President, since our last meeting last year, the relations between our countries have been developing very successfully. For the first time since 2014, we observed a positive dynamics of trade growth last year. The same stable growth was observed in the first quarter of this year. Your economy has about $400 million of Russian direct investments. I hope this figure will grow.
We have a lot to talk about. We are very glad to see you.
President of Croatia Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (retranslated): Mr President,
I would like to express heartfelt thanks to you, not only personally and on behalf of the delegation that arrived with me, but also on behalf of all Croatian representatives of the national team, the Croatian team and all Croatian fans who are staying in Russia during the World Cup and feel totally at home.
Before we proceed to considering bilateral issues, I would like to say a couple of words as an avid football fan. I want to congratulate you on this World Cup being an example for the rest of the world of how such events should be organised, because you not only ensured the freedom of movement for football fans but also prevented any incidents or statements that can be seen as hate speech. This is a true example for everyone in the world. I hope that this World Cup will be cherished as such by people.
Mr President, I would like to once again thank you personally for inviting me. This is the third time I have visited Russia, and I would like to thank the receiving side for organising these trips. I feel very much at home here, and I am very pleased about the way I was welcomed in Nizhny Novgorod and Sochi. Our fans and I feel totally at home.
I am very pleased that our formal meeting today begins with a pleasant informal moment ­–­ an anticipation of Croatia's possible victory.
Let us proceed to more serious issues. Our meeting today is taking place at a special time, just between the latest NATO summit and your upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump. This meeting is also taking place amidst important things happening in Russia-Croatia relations.
