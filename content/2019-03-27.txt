Congratulations on National Guard Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, veterans,
Please accept my best wishes on your professional holiday, the National Guard Day.
The Russian National Guard proudly continues and expands the best traditions of Interior Ministry Troops, OMON Special Police Force and SOBR Rapid Deployment Task Force units, extra-departmental security units and the Licensing Service in a befitting manner. This continuity, extremely high training levels and impeccable professionalism serve as a reliable foundation for successfully accomplishing your diverse tasks.
You spearhead the fight against such threats as terrorism, extremism and organised crime. You assume tremendous responsibility for maintaining law and order during public events, for reliably shielding key industrial facilities and infrastructure and for organising efficient control in such an important sphere as arms sales.
All these aspects of your everyday work require the utmost concentration, resoluteness and determination, as well as unfailing compliance with the law, respect for the rights and freedoms of citizens and the dignity of every person.
I want to note that commanders and soldiers, the entire National Guard service personnel, always honourably fulfil their orders, while maintaining the security of our citizens, society and state. They act bravely, skilfully and efficiently. I am confident that this will continue in the future.
Thank you for your service. I wish you, your families and loved ones every success, health and all the best. Congratulations on the holiday once again.
