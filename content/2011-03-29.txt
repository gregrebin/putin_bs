President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Smirnov, the terrorist attacks in Moscow metro were committed one year ago today. The investigation has been ongoing, with the involvement of FSB and Investigative Committee professionals. The main result achieved in this time is that the entire group suspected of committing this grave crime has been discovered. A significant part of the suspects have been eliminated during special operations. This punishment is absolutely just.
In addition, a special operation was recently carried out in Ingushetia with fairly impressive results. Please tell me about what has been done and what are the results of this operation.
First Deputy Director of the Federal Security Service Sergei Smirnov: Mr President, we have recently conducted a number of operations in collaboration with the Investigative Committee aimed at clarifying all the circumstances of the terrorist attack at the Domodedovo Airport. The operation in Ingushetia was targeted specifically at those persons [involved in the terrorist attack]. On March 28, the FSB in cooperation with the Interior Ministry, Defence Ministry and Investigative Committee carried out a special operation in the mountainous forests of Ingushetia to eliminate one of the training bases which, according to our data, is actively used to train suicide bombers.
In a pinpoint airstrike by the Air Force, followed by a ground operation conducted by the special forces and Interior Ministry troops, the infrastructure, including bunkers and shelters, was destroyed, weapons that were found there were seized and 17 militants were killed, according to preliminary data.
At the same time, Aslan Tsechoyev, an accomplice of the militants, put up armed resistance during his arrest and was killed in Verkhniye Achaluki, Ingushetia. Unfortunately, two officers of the FSB Ingushetia branch and one special forces officer were killed during the raid.
”I expect to receive a full report on the results of this operation from the Federal Security Service, as the agency responsible for coordinating anti-terrorist efforts. We must continue operations to destroy the militants since, unfortunately, problems still remain in a number of our North Caucasus republics and this is the way to resolve them.“
On the same day, Monday, March 28, two of the Yandiyev brothers were arrested. According to our data, they were directly involved in the organisation of the Domodedovo Airport terrorist attack. At present they are being interviewed by investigation officers.
Work will continue at the site of the operation to identify the bodies of those killed and clarify all the events that occurred there. So, the investigation is continuing.
Dmitry Medvedev: You have managed to destroy the criminals’ lair, and that is a success. I believe that you have worked well in collaboration with the government agencies you have named, and have dealt a hard blow to the militants. As for our comrades who have been killed, we must do everything to support their families and grant them state decorations for giving their lives defending our nation and our country.
I expect to receive a full report on the results of this operation from the Federal Security Service, as the agency responsible for coordinating anti-terrorist efforts. We must continue operations to destroy the militants since, unfortunately, problems still remain in a number of our North Caucasus republics and this is the way to resolve them.
We must persist and bring these efforts to conclusion, so that every militant realises that his fate is in his own hands: either he stops fighting, and in that case he has a chance to get out of this situation, or he continues his criminal activities, and in this case he will inevitably be eliminated.
Sergei Smirnov: We will carry out all your instructions.

Meeting with students and faculty of technical universities.
The meeting took place at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (Technical University).
A meeting of the Commission for Modernisation and Technological Development of Russia’s Economy will take place on Wednesday, March 30, 2011, in Magnitogorsk. This will be the last in a series of meetings on developing engineering education. Following the meeting, Dmitry Medvedev will sign a list of instructions.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon, everyone. I am very happy to see you.
I am not going to talk too much to begin with so that you have a chance to ask me any questions you may have and I also want to hear your thoughts about ways to develop education in general, and engineering education in particular.
Here is a point I want to make at the start. When I was a high school senior, and that was way back in 1982, ancient history, but at that time I was a rare species among my classmates because I was one of the few people who went on to study at a Humanities University for some unknown reason, at St Petersburg University. The vast majority of my peers in Leningrad at the time chose engineering schools. And I remember having to explain what it was the Law Department taught at all because funny as it sounds today, back then people didn’t know that. There was so little demand for lawyers that people didn’t even realise what they did and I had to explain that they could become judges, prosecutors or police officers – whereas practically all my friends from school became engineers.
”I decided to pay special attention to engineers because it is a key profession for building a new economy and modernising technology. Obviously, the nation needs engineers.“
A great deal of time has passed since then and a lot has changed in our country. In 2010, 217,000 graduates enrolled at engineering universities, which is a fairly good number. Thirty percent of universities are engineering schools, universities that train engineers, and in total there are 555 of them around the country.
You study at some of those universities, and I don’t just mean the Moscow Power Engineering Institute. There are teachers and students from other engineering schools here as well. I would really like to hear what you think about the current situation. 
Some time ago I decided to pay special attention to engineers because it is a key profession for building a new economy and modernising technology. Obviously, the nation needs engineers, as it is also clear that the 1990s were a difficult decade for engineers and for engineering education. We have some recent achievements, though, and you will probably be able to tell me which initiatives have succeeded and which have not.
As part of this effort I first travelled to Khakassia and met with engineers there. They have a lot of engineers there and they told me about their work. The situation in some places is better than in others. Later I met with their employers, the companies that commission engineering projects, and I found out where their priorities lie, what kind of professionals they want to see come out of universities, which professions they have a demand for, what kind of training do they need and to what extent should they be involved in production processes. Tomorrow I will hold the final meeting on this issue, a meeting of the Commission for Modernisation and Technological Development of Russia’s Economy, and after that I will sign a list of instructions. Today I would very much like you to tell me absolutely honestly and frankly what you think we should do both to attract students to the engineering profession, and in general, to support engineering professionals in our country. I don’t need to tell you why we need this because you all know the answer to that. So now, I think it’s time for me to stop talking and pass on the word to you.
