With President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am happy to welcome you to the Russian capital. We are glad that our interstate relations are recovering, and very quickly.
The last time we met in this format [the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council] was quite a while ago, in 2014. Many things have happened since then. We have been working hard recently to advance Russian-Turkish relations to a befitting level.

We are working energetically to settle the most acute crises in the world, primarily in Syria. I am pleased to say that our military agencies and special services are developing such effective contacts, which nobody seemed to expect.
We are also restoring our trade and economic ties. As far as I know, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev
updated his Turkish colleague yesterday on the additional measures and steps to restore our economic relations in full measure. We carry on our investment cooperation and are preparing to implement large projects.
We are glad to see you in Moscow. Welcome.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan
(retranslated): I would like to express gratitude to my dear friend.
There was a gap in the work of the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council. As you know, we have recently met at the World Energy Forum. The forum was highly effective, in particular in the context of our contacts. Cooperation between Russia and Turkey is of special significance. It is gaining momentum in the gas sector and other areas. Our cooperation is returning to normal and is gathering speed under the Turkish Stream gas pipeline and the Akkuyu nuclear power plant projects.
I believe that today the High-Level Cooperation Council will focus on the economy, trade, the defence industry, energy and other issues. I am sure that this meeting will contribute to the further development of our relations.
Thank you.
