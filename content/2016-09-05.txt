With President of Argentina Mauricio Macri.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very pleased to have this chance to meet you and to continue the interstate relations that our countries have built up over these last years.
We have active contacts through our ministries and agencies in a broad range of areas. We have inter-parliamentary cooperation and work together closely at the international and regional levels.
If I recall correctly, Argentina will hold the G20 presidency in 2018.
Argentina is one of Russia’s most prominent trade and economic partners in Latin America. Despite the many difficulties we discussed today, our bilateral trade increased by 1.7 percent over the first six months of this year.
President of Argentina Mauricio Macri
(retranslated): Mr President, it is also a great honour for me to meet you in person and further strengthen the ties between Russia and Argentina.
Mr President, we also consider it very important to develop our bilateral ties in different areas. This concerns culture, sports, and developing linguistic ties too. In this respect, of course, one important matter is that of the RT – Russia Today – television channel.
Another very important area is energy sector cooperation. As you know, Argentina is experiencing considerable difficulties in this area and we need to deepen our cooperation in this area, particularly as concerns hydroelectric power plants.
