With Acting Governor of Kirov Region Nikita Belykh.
The Acting Governor reported in particular on progress in implementing the May 2012 Presidential Executive Orders, the development outlook in the industry and agriculture sectors, and measures the region is taking to resolve housing problems.
Mr Belykh
said the regionâ€™s traditional agriculture sectors such as dairy produce and pork have good potential, and the recent import restrictions introduced by the Government could give a new boost to producers in these sectors. There is also good potential in the chemicals industry, fertiliser production, timber processing, and in the newly emerging biotechnology sector, which is showing good development.
