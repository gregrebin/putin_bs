Naturally, we also discussed humanitarian issues, although in some general terms. Nevertheless, we are giving them a great deal of attention. I know that this fall, Ukraine will hold Days of Russian Education and Culture, and within the framework of these events, presentations will be made on Russia’s leading universities and research schools. There will also be presentations regarding current achievements by educators and scientists, as well as interesting educational programmes.
I hope that Mr Yanukovych will respond favourably to my invitation and come to the Russian Federation on a state visit this autumn.
Thank you for your attention.
Question: I have a question for both presidents about the documents signed today, specifically, the first two.
Regarding the Declaration on Strategic Partnership between Ukraine and Russia, what does this document contain, what is it about?
Also, regarding the agreement on dividing the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, what principles is it based on? 
Viktor Yanukovych: The Declaration reflects the overall nature of our relations in all the different cooperation fields. In short, it highlights these relations’ strategic nature.
Vladimir Putin: I agree with Mr Yanukovych’s assessment. We see this as a fundamental bilateral document of the kind our countries have not yet had. It really does reflect our cooperation priorities – political cooperation, economic ties in various sectors, and our cooperation in border areas and so forth. 
What I want to stress, in other words, is that this is a basic document that lays the foundations for our relations in practically every area of cooperation.
”It is very clear that energy, oil and gas should not be our only absolute priority, although these are important, of course. Our priorities should be the high-tech production sectors: aircraft engineering, air and space, telecommunications, transport.“
Regarding the agreement on the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, it is not about dividing these seas: we are not about to divide up the Black Sea between us, and will leave the Sea of Azov alone too. The agreement is about definitively demarcating our borders here.“it is very clear that energy, oil and gas should not be our only absolute priority, although these are important, of course. Our priorities should be the high-tech production sectors: aircraft engineering, air and space, telecommunications, transp“
Let me note in this respect that our foreign ministries and our experts have reached principled agreements on how to ensure that this meets both countries’ interests. We all examined this today, and overall, Mr Yanukovych and I both agree with the approach proposed.
The point of this document is set our colleagues in the spirit for completing this work and signing the relevant agreement. What we did today was to confirm the principles upon which this work will be based. By and large, the rest is now just a question of legal procedures.
Question: I have a question for the President of Ukraine.
Mr President, you recently sent your Presidential Address to the Parliament and for the first time did not deliver it personally there. The Address contains an interesting passage on Ukraine’s foreign policy, naming integration with Europe as the top priority. Russia, meanwhile, got placed in a fine group that includes the USA and China. 
De facto this document is yours, but de jure you have not said this. My question, therefore, is, does it state your personal position, the Foreign Ministry’s position, the state authorities’ position, and, in the run-up to October, is there some kind of public consensus on this issue?
Viktor Yanukovych: This document is not something new but is based on the strategy that has already been adopted in the form of some of our basic documents. The law on the basic principles of our domestic and foreign policy, for example, states that Ukraine makes integration with Europe a priority. This same law defines Ukraine’s status as being outside all blocs, and so on.
As for the Address, it is also a strategic document with lengthy preparation gone into it, and what it states is the natural and consistent continuation of the policies that we began in 2010.
Vladimir Putin: I would just like to add a couple of words.
That Russia has been put together with countries such as the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America does not offend us in any way but on the contrary flatters us. We are happy to be with them.
As for the European Union taking precedence, this does not offend us either, because we understand the scope of cooperation, technology and so on that is behind this. Ultimately, deciding priorities of this kind is the sovereign choice of each country and people, and we will of course respect these decisions. 
I hope that the EU, despite the problems it is going through with Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Italy, will pay attention to the post-Soviet countries too, which have declared their choices so clearly. I hope the EU will draw its conclusions in this respect. We all want cooperation with Europe. Russia wants it, Ukraine wants it, and so do the other post-Soviet region countries. 
Question: I have a question for the Russian President on the gas sector. Under what conditions would Russia be willing to revise the price formula for gas sales to Ukraine? Kiev has been seeking this for more than two years now.
Vladimir Putin: Do you remember the words of that book we all love so much, ‘Can I get the chairs in the evening and give you the money in the morning?’ ‘Yes, but the money comes first!’
