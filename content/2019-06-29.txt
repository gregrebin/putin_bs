Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe (retranslated): Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
In May of last year, together with President Putin we held a ceremony in the Bolshoi Theatre to launch the Cross-Year of Russia and Japan.
A year has passed, filled with diverse events held in both countries to help our peoples learn about the beauty of each other.
Over 600 events held in Russia were attended by over 1.5 million people. They include a guest tour by the Kabuki theatre, demonstration horseback archery performances and martial art exchanges. All these events demonstrated very well the appeal of Japan.
People in Japan could get an insight into the essence of Russian culture, which is the pride of the world, such as an exhibition of paintings from the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts and performances by the Mariinsky ballet.
Over this year, the people of Japan and Russia demonstrated a growing interest and affinity for each other.
Today we have invited here those who worked selflessly to promote ties with Russia. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who helped us during the cross-year and my joy over the successful completion of the Cross-Year of Russia and Japan.
The cross-year ends today, but we decided together with President Putin to hold the first ever Japanese-Russian year of interregional exchange to take bilateral contacts to the outmost regions of our countries. Every region in our two countries has its inimitable traditions and distinctive features.
In conclusion, I would like to express hope in the continued development of ties between our countries.
Thank you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
Today’s ceremony is the final event of the Year of Russia in Japan and the Year of Japan in Russia and a chance to review the huge job we did together to promote humanitarian cooperation aimed at bringing our peoples closer together.
The programme of the cross-year was truly attractive, grand and filled with interesting events. It covered nearly all spheres of our bilateral relations, including culture, the arts, education and tourism.
Russia and Japan have successfully held over 700 different events, including exhibitions of works of art from Russian and Japanese museums, film and theatre festivals, musical tours, while sailing ships have also called at both countries’ ports.
Joint projects in the field of healthcare, cutting-edge technology and municipal administrations have been implemented.
Russia has successfully hosted performances given by Japan’s Nippon Budokan Martial Arts House.
In April, Japanese tourists conducted a fact-finding tour of the Trans-Siberian Railway along the Following the Sun route and travelled across all of Russia, from Vladivostok to Moscow.
Last week, St Petersburg was the venue of a workshop on restoring Japanese swords from Russian museums’ collections. This is the first such unique event to have taken place in our country.
The Ambassador of Japan to Russia has just pointed out that a Japanese pianist has come second at the International Tchaikovsky Competition. But this is not linked with events of our cross-years. I sincerely congratulate this Japanese musician on his landmark victory from the bottom of my heart, and I wish him every success. This was entirely his own doing.
The Japanese audience was really interested in the Russian figure skating team’s public training sessions. The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet organised a number of performances in Tokyo and some other Japanese cities, including Osaka. These events highlighted the rich traditions of Russian choreography.
I would like to note that many of these performances involved outstanding cultural workers and artists of our countries, prominent specialists in the field of education, science and sports, members of parliament and creative young individuals.
Today, we are witnessing performances given by very young talented people. Young soloists from the Moscow Chamber Choir and the Japanese Children’s Choir will perform both countries’ folk songs, and they will also display their professionalism while performing classical music.
It goes without saying that the cross-years have provided a serious impulse to expanding the entire range of bilateral relations, have helped establish direct contacts between people and have, in general, facilitated stronger neighbourly ties between our countries.
I would like to thank all the participants in these numerous events from the bottom of my heart. And, as Shinzo [Abe] has just said, we have agreed to launch a new project called the Year of Russian-Japanese Inter-Regional and Twin City Exchanges.
I am particularly happy to say this here in Osaka, the twin city of St Petersburg, my home city. This important initiative is called on to impart a new quality to diverse mutually beneficial ties between Russian and Japanese regions.
Most importantly, work will continue to form an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation between our countries and peoples.
Thank you. Arigato.

Meeting with President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan

With President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Vladimir Putin had a meeting with President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan
on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very glad to have another chance to meet with you and discuss our current issues.
I would like to stress from the onset the 16 percent trade growth in 2018. We both know that either side has a significant investment volume of $10 billion each.
Currently we are resolving the issue – and I believe it should be sped up – of establishing a €900 million investment platform.
Implementation of our large projects is underway, I will not speak about it now, as we are well aware of these matters.
Turkey’s upcoming participation as a partner country in the 10th INNOPROM International Industrial Trade Fair in Yekaterinburg in July will be an important event.
In addition, the tourist exchange is growing: last year six million Russian tourists visited Turkey, which is a record number.
They are no cheapskates, they know how to enjoy their holidays, so the revenues of the Turkish partners reached $5 billion.
I think the ambitious programme of the current Cross Year of Culture and Tourism in Russia and Turkey will lead to new achievements in the area.
We have many other items on our bilateral and international agendas, so I would like to stress again that I am very glad to see you.
President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan (retranslated): Mr President, my dear friend,
I would like to especially focus on the new impetus we have given to our relations recently.
The S-400 delivery – we continue watching over this process in accordance with our agreement reached in Dushanbe.
I would like to note that joint missile production as well as technology transfer has a priority for our cooperation. As far as I know, there has been no delay with this delivery.
Also, the next meeting of our joint economic commission will be held in Turkey.
As you said about tourism, Russia’s and Russian citizens’ love for our country is growing daily. It means a lot for our people and for tourism, for the tourism sector, and is another major force.
Another crucial part is the Akkuyu nuclear power plant. Launching the first generating unit in 2023 is of major significance for implementing this task.
On the other hand, we attach great importance to the non-nuclear equipment being provided by the Turkish market.

Beginning of meeting with Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe (retranslated): Mr President, welcome to Japan! I am glad that after our last encounter in Moscow we are meeting here in Osaka.
We are witnessing a positive dynamic in all areas of Russian-Japanese relations. We have just attended the closing ceremony for the first-ever Cross Years of Russia and Japan, and we have successfully deepened, expanded and stepped up exchanges between our nations.
I would also like to note that for the first time in the past nine years the Japanese-Russian council of governors brought together an unprecedented number of governors.
Now, in order to increase the flow of people between the two countries to at least 400,000 by 2023, we are trying to expand the grounds for exchanges, including the World Rugby Cup, the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games, and other events.
Today I hope to have a discussion with you on signing a peace treaty with consideration of the results of the meetings between our foreign ministers and our negotiators. I also hope for an exchange of opinions on bilateral cooperation issues in various areas and in international issues.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
First of all, I would like to congratulate you and your colleagues on the successful hosting and completion of the G20 summit. It was a big job, and it is largely you who deserves the credit for such good results.
It was not always easy to bring together positions that were often at the opposite ends of the spectrum on key issues of global development and the development of the world economy.
I hope the spirit of Osaka that we have felt here and the results of our work will stay with us for the rest of the year and maybe even for a few more years.
We have completed the wonderful cross-years, and have just marked it in a wonderful concert hall in Osaka.
I agree with you: we have made considerable advances in many areas in developing our relations.
I would like to thank you for inviting my colleagues and me on a specially organised visit to Japan, despite such a great amount of work due to the G20 summit.
I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss the range of issues in our relations including, the peace treaty.
<…>

With Crown Prince and Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud.
Vladimir Putin met with Crown Prince and Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the G20 Summit.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, we started discussing some issues of mutual interest yesterday.
I am glad to have this opportunity to speak in a regular working mode about our bilateral issues, matters of mutual interest in the region and in international affairs.
First of all, I would like to say that Saudi Arabia assuming the G20 presidency at the end of the year is certain to contribute to solving priority issues of international relations that the G20 deals with.
On our part we will do everything we can to support your presidency.
I would like to ask you to pass on my gratitude to his Majesty the King for his invitation to visit Saudi Arabia. I hope this visit will take place this autumn, as agreed.
I am also glad to have a chance to share my considerations with you on how we are going to build up our work in the global energy markets. This work has been developing and yielding positive results largely thanks to you persistent efforts.
I am glad to have this meeting and a chance to speak with you on all the issues and on all the problems.
Crown Prince and Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to relate a greeting from the Custodian of the Two Holy MosquesKing Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. We would like to say that we always welcome your visit.
In recent years we have seen dynamic development in our bilateral relations in the political area and also in the economy, defence, culture and security.
I think the more often we meet, the more opportunities we will find for further progress.
Praise be to Allah, we have mutual trust. We will continue working for the benefit of our bilateral relations.

Meeting on floods in the Irkutsk Region
Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting on floods that have affected a number of districts in Irkutsk Region.
June 29, 2019

4 of 4
Meeting on floods in the Irkutsk Region.
The meeting was attended by Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev
, Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Siberian Federal District Sergei Menyailo
, Irkutsk Region Governor Sergei Levchenko
, First Deputy Prime Minister – Finance Minister Anton Siluanov
, as well as heads of relevant ministries, agencies and municipal entities.
Heavy rainfall has caused flash floods in Irkutsk Region. An emergency situation has been declared in the region.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
Over the past few days, as you are all well aware, Irkutsk Region experienced large-scale floods. Nizhneudinsky, Taishetsky, Tulunsky and Chunsky districts have suffered the greatest damage.
Unfortunately, there have been victims as well. Dozens of villages were flooded, homes destroyed, transportation, social and communal infrastructure disrupted. Today we will assess the situation here and look into what we can do and what we must do first of all.
We need to get down immediately to the following tasks. First, we must inform people about what is going on, where temporary accommodation can be found, and where they can get medical aid, potable water, food, medicine and essential items.
Let me stress that special attention must be paid to providing an uninterrupted supply of as much drinking water as needed. I am asking regional and local authorities as well as the federal agencies’ local bodies to stay in touch with the people and respond swiftly to their complaints and requests; among other things, we must help them find their families and create lists of those who have been evacuated so that their families and officials, of course, know who is where at this very moment.
Unfortunately, the floods continue, so we must establish additional temporary accommodation with all the necessary equipment in advance.
Secondly, we must immediately, practically today, begin paying the victims compensation. The government has already made its decision and the treasury and the Central Bank are down to work. However, let me stress that it is necessary that the money does not just get as far as the region itself– according to the Finance Minister’s report, it is already here in the region – that money must be given out to the people, to every person and to every family. I would like to instruct the governor to control this as strictly as possible.
Let me repeat this: we must start paying compensation right now, without waiting for the full and checked lists of the victims, although, of course, this must also be done immediately.
Third. Please keep the epidemiologic situation under control, primarily in the disaster-hit areas. This is a job primarily for Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being] and the Health Ministry.
In fourth place come the children affected in the areas where there is flooding. They should be sent to summer camps, including those in other regions. Younger children must be accommodated together with their parents. The presidential envoy has already reported that these issues are being coordinated with the leadership of the adjacent regions but I would like to ask my colleagues from federal departments to see to it that children are sent not only to places nearby, but also to places around the country: there are plenty of summer camps for children.
Fifth. Prices of essential items must be strictly controlled and profiteers and unfair vendors should not be given the opportunity to make money on people’s misfortune. The Federal Antimonopoly Service and, if necessary, the Ministry of the Interior should step in when it comes to this.
Sixth. Please work out at once an action plan for housing restoration in order to complete this job as soon as possible. We understand only too well what the situation in the Siberian regions is like – summer is very short here and winter comes quickly, but the water levels are still high. When shall we build then?
There is very little time. Everything must be done so that people will not have to live in tents when the cold comes. And in general, all possible scenarios must be provided for.
We also need to promptly evaluate all the damage and to commence to restore the infrastructure, meaning the electricity, communications, transport, health care and educational facilities: schools, kindergartens and hospitals. Children should resume studying on time, in September.
I am instructing the Emergencies Ministry, the Irkutsk regional authorities and the relevant federal ministries to start at once to calculate the scope of the restoration work and to determine what kind of additional materials are required and how much funding will be needed, what building resources and materials, including from the neighboring regions, and if necessary from remote regions too.
Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoys in the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts should assume control and coordinate the entire job.
I would like to once again repeat: all the tasks that I have mentioned have to be performed seamlessly, through interaction between all the levels of authority. It is extremely important in such situations.
I expect to hear your detailed reports on the situation and immediate plans. I would like to stress once again: plans for the short and middle term, considering the need to restore everything I have already mentioned: infrastructure, living quarters and social facilities.
Let us get down to work.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: Following our meeting today, draft instructions have been drawn up and I am now going to sign them. However, there is another thing we have all noticed: the scale is huge, in fact, the disaster is not over yet, the floods continue. It is not clear when the water levels will go down, we can only make estimations. And we are running out of time when it comes to restoring things. This is why I believe it is necessary to establish a governmental commission considering the scale of this natural disaster in Irkutsk Region, in order to coordinate the activities of the local, regional and federal authorities to timely restore the transport, energy and social facilities as well as living quarters, including houses. The commission will be headed by Vitaly Mutko. I will inform him in just a moment.
I believe that all the representatives of both regional and federal agencies as well as my municipal colleagues must coordinate their work as carefully as possible. The result will largely depend on this.
I am asking you not to regard your tasks as just a formality but to work properly. There are many victims and we have a lot to get done. The final result will depend on the coordination of this work.
It is impossible to deliver anything if there is no transport and the transport infrastructure is not put back in order. It is impossible to work if there is no electricity. Of course, if no seeds arrive in time, it will be impossible to restore anything related to cattle breeding and so on; the task would not be solved in general. I am not even mentioning healthcare. We understand how important it is.
This is why I am once again calling on you all to work together, actively and effectively. I will gather everyone I need in Moscow on July 3 to look into the developments and how the work is being organised. We will discuss this once again in Moscow.
I would like to wish you every success in your joint work.

With Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
: President Putin, I would like to welcome you once again in Japan.
Osaka is a sister city of St. Petersburg, your hometown, and you visited Osaka when you served as Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg. I am delighted that our meeting is taking place in this city, considering your long-standing ties with it.
Official agreement on the participation of Japanese enterprises in the Arctic LNG 2 project has just been reached. I would like to praise this cooperation agreement, which facilitates Russia’s efforts to develop the Arctic and ensures stable energy supply to our country
In addition, the two sides agreed on investments to set up a prevention and diagnostics medical centre in the city of Khabarovsk using Japan’s experience and technology as its foundation.
The eight-point cooperation plan that I put forward three years ago paved the way to more than 200 projects, and we intend to expand mutually beneficial cooperation moving forward.
The two sides have set a goal to increase mutual travel flows to 200,000 people from each of the countries to a total of 400,000 visitors per year. To this effect, we intend to promote deeper economic ties and step up inter-regional, university and other ties.
Just now, during the closing ceremony of the Japanese-Russian cross-year, which was a great success, I announced that next year would be the first Japanese-Russian year of inter-regional exchange.
Next year, Osaka and St Petersburg will mark the 40th anniversary of their sister city relationship. We are looking forward to further deepening these contacts and hope that new inter-regional links will be formed by various regions of our respective countries.
Japan also intends to ease visa requirements for Russian entrepreneurs as part of the eight-point cooperation plan beginning September 2019 in order to encourage bilateral contacts. This is a special initiative devised specifically for Russia.
A decision was also taken to streamline visa procedures for students from 465 Russian higher educational institutions with the view to expanding youth contacts. After all, the future of bilateral relations is in the hands of our youth.
Japanese and Russian defence and security agencies held a two-plus-two format meeting in late 2018 and maintain contacts in various areas, contributing to deepening trust between our countries on security matters. I commend this trend.
In addition to this, Japan and Russia have been committed to stepping up cooperation on non-conventional and global threats such as combating drug trafficking, cyber attacks, money laundering, etc.
President Putin and I welcome the progress made on the peace treaty, which is in line with the commitment we expressed in November 2018 in Singapore to accelerate negotiations for a peace treaty based on the 1956 joint declaration, to coordinate our positions and continue talks on these matters.
Furthermore, in keeping with what we declared following our meeting in Nagato, today we reaffirmed our sincere commitment to resolving problems related to the peace treaty and agreed to welcome preparations for undertaking joint economic activity in the four northern islands. Japan and Russia will jointly release a document to this effect.
As for joint economic activity on the four northern islands, we have noted proactive efforts to implement these projects.
Today, President Putin and I approved business models for two projects: one on tourism and the other on waste management. We also agreed on arranging a pilot tourist trip and carrying out a pilot project on mutual visits by Japanese and Russian experts in waste management.
We also welcome efforts to further the discussion on the conditions and legal framework for the movement of people as part of this joint economic activity.
Bilateral cooperation has been successful in the sphere of humanitarian measures that are intended to benefit current and former residents of the islands.
President Putin and I agreed to arrange visits to burial sites by plane in August or September.
Talks on the peace treaty have been underway since we reached an agreement to this effect at the November bilateral summit that took place in Singapore last year.
Today, President Putin and I had a frank discussion on various matters, including on ways to further promote the negotiating process and its prospects.
Overcoming differences on complex matters that have lingered for the last 70 years since the war ended is not an easy task. However, an outline of the matters that we have to address is becoming increasingly clear.
President Putin and I understand like no one else the strategic importance of strengthening Japanese-Russian relations, and the critical role of the peace treaty in these efforts. We must be resolute in the steps we take, understanding that only the strong will of President Putin and myself can push this momentum forward.
President Putin and I reaffirmed this vision today. I strongly believe that together with President Putin we will continue to move forward in this direction one step at a time in order to further develop ties between our countries.
Thank you for your attention.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
First of all, dear Shinzo, allow me to congratulate you once again on the success of the G20 Summit you have hosted.
I would like to thank you for inviting me to make this visit to Japan at a time that coincided with this major international event. As you know, we have already attended together the closing ceremony of the Year of Russia in Japan and the Year of Japan in Russia.
Ahead of us, we still have the expanded-format talks that will be attended by those heads of our ministries and agencies that are proactively involved in Russia-Japan cooperation. Let me note that the Prime Minister of Japan and I have been able to review the main items on the bilateral agenda in considerable detail. We also exchanged views on topical international and regional problems. The joint documents that have just been signed are designed to expand cooperation in various areas.
For Russia, Japan is an important partner with whom we are seeking to build mutually beneficial relations as good neighbours and by taking into consideration each other’s interests. Our countries have established close political dialogue. One month ago, the heads of our respective foreign and defence ministries had a two-plus-two format meeting. There are regular consultations between our security councils, as well as inter-parliamentary ties.
There is also steady progress in our mutual trade, which increased by 17 percent last year and added another 7 percent in the first four months of 2019. This shows that the Russian-Japanese Intergovernmental Commission has been effective; the projects outlined as part of the eight-point cooperation plan proposed by Mr Abe are being consistently implemented, as well as Russia’s strategy to expand trade and economic cooperation.
Today, we adopted a joint statement dedicated to our future efforts pertaining to these two essential documents. In particular, Russia’s national projects will benefit from Japanese technology and investment. We see unwavering interest on behalf of Japanese businesses in cooperating with Russia. Right now, some 270 Japanese companies are represented on the Russian market. The Russia-Japan Investment Fund and investment platform have built a positive track record.
Business leaders and investors from Japan have proactively contributed to the recent St Petersburg International Economic Forum. We will be glad to see Mr Abe and his Japanese colleagues at the upcoming Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok in September.
Energy is the main area of our bilateral cooperation. Japanese companies are involved in the Sakhalin 2 project. Our Japanese partners from Mitsui, Japan’s national oil, gas and metals corporation, have just signed an important agreement to join the construction of the Arctic LNG 2 project that envisages investment of almost three billion dollars.
Rosatom continues its efforts to facilitate the Fukushima relief effort. A number of initiatives are being explored to recycle spent nuclear fuel, possibly with the involvement of third countries. We are expanding our ties in high tech spheres. An agreement has been reached whereby Canon of Japan will build facilities in Russia in order to manufacture state-of-the-art medical diagnostics equipment in our country.
Another project on the agenda is the laying of a new high-speed data cable linking Japan and Europe. In particular, it includes connecting Nakhodka and Niigata by submarine cable.
There is also momentum in transport and infrastructure cooperation. A series of pilot container shipments were carried out along the Trans-Siberian Railway, showing that this is an economically viable route for expanding deliveries of Japanese products to European markets.
In 2020, Russia and Japan are to hold cross years of inter-regional exchange. This initiative is expected to promote deeper contacts between regions, as Mr Prime Minister and I agreed today.
Of course, Mr Abe and I discussed matters related to the peace treaty, and were both happy to see that our foreign ministers established meaningful dialogue on a topic that is challenging and sensitive for both countries. We expect this dialogue to carry on, and believe that a lot of effort will be required to take relations between Russia and Japan to a new level.
Whether or not we succeed in strengthening trust and neighbourly relations between the peoples of Russia and Japan and create conditions for finding mutually acceptable solutions for the most complex issues will depend on these efforts.
In this connection, it is noteworthy that we have succeeded in making some progress in launching joint economic activity on the islands. We approved business models for two out of the five areas identified by Mr Abe and myself. A number of pilot projects are to be carried out in the near future.
When discussing urgent international problems we paid special attention to developments surrounding the Korean Peninsula. I informed Mr Abe of the outcomes of the April 25 talks with Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un in Vladivostok.
We proceed from the premise that the peninsula’s nuclear and missile problems can be resolved only by peaceful political and diplomatic means. What we need is a commitment to dialogue from all the countries involved. This is the only way to ensure security and foster development in Northeast Asia, a region that is home to both Russia and Japan.
To conclude, I would like once again to express my gratitude to Mr Prime Minister and all our Japanese colleagues and friends for their warm hospitality and our meaningful talks with them.
Thank you for your attention.

Vladimir Putin’s news conference
Following the G20 summit, the President of Russia answered journalists’ questions.
June 29, 2019
10:50
Osaka
1 of 8
News conference following the G20 Summit.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Let us begin. Go ahead, please.
Question: Good afternoon, Mr President. We would like to ask, since I am the first to ask a question, about your personal results of the summit. There was a lot of scepticism prior to it, coming both from other leaders and expressed by you, concerning the possible results of the summit. Was the scepticism justified? What are the outcomes for world trade and the global economy?
And the second question, if I may: what were Russia’s objectives here at the G20, and were the results achieved?
Vladimir Putin: There was certain scepticism, it is true, and not from me alone. Yet on the whole the G20 summit has proved its relevance, we have to admit that, and it was effective in all the major areas of work. The result has been achieved. I think we can congratulate the Japanese presidency on that. Japan did a lot for the summit’s success, and its efforts paid off.
I would like to single out four major fields where the needed agreements have been reached. It is true that there were no breakthrough decisions. However, all the participants reconfirmed their commitment to continue efforts to improve the global trade system, including work to reform the WTO. The very fact that everyone confirmed the need for the process and reaffirmed their readiness to work along the lines is a positive development in itself.
Positions have been coordinated, except for the United States, which always has a special opinion. In fact, the US delegation was open about it from the outset. Everyone knows the current Administration’s stance on the Paris Accords. Nevertheless, all the other participants in the forum confirmed their readiness to implement the agreements under the Paris Accords.
Actually, I think there is also a positive moment in the US position too, since the Americans said they were ready to work on the environmental agenda under their own programme. We have to read the final wording but the fact that the Americans say they also want to contribute to solving environmental issues is a positive thing, in my view.
As to Russia, we spoke about it a number of times and we reaffirmed that at the forum again and also agreed on that in the final document. We are going to fully comply with our commitments. In the nearest future we will begin the ratification of these agreements and will conduct the necessary domestic procedures. These issues are highly relevant for us.
I stated this at the last plenary session. Let me remind you that according to the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, the warming in Russia is happening 2.5 times faster than the average global warming. This is a major challenge for us. We must realise that. This is the reason for floods, and for permafrost thawing in the areas where we have fairly big cities. We must be able to understand how to react to the climate changes underway there.
In this connection, I informed my colleagues on our national programme in the sphere of environment, a transition to the best available technologies in this area, as well as on a number of other measures we are taking in this field.
Next, it is crucial for us, and I think it is also a very positive thing – we all know that the Internet is regulated in various ways by different countries. Nevertheless, all the G20 summit participants concluded that we must do everything to prevent negative information that is related to terrorism from spreading online. It must be careful joint work that is utterly important not only for the G20 nations but also for the whole world. The major trends that I have just listed are of interest to us and they all are part of our priorities.
Oh, sorry, I missed another important area, as I said there were four of them. The fourth is digitalisation and work on AI. The G20 has been dealing with that, and it has dealt with it here, and there is a common decision on it. It is giving recommendations and indicating a direction for its development. As you know, we are working on our own AI programme. We have made a decision and the details are being finalised now, but it is also very important for us. It is unquestionably one of our development priorities.
Please, go ahead.
Question: I would like to ask you about your meeting with Mr Trump. If you had any expectations, did they materialise, and what did you talk about? I am particularly interested if there is any progress on extending the New START treaty.
And another issue. When Mr Trump refused to meet with you at the previous G20 meeting, he said it was because of the situation in the Kerch Strait and that he would not meet until the Ukrainian sailors are released. Will you please tell us if he raised this topic this time.
Vladimir Putin: To begin with, this topic was raised, I do not remember now if it was during the lunch or during our meeting, but the President of the United States made this topic a priority of our communication at the G20 summit. We also spoke about other issues, naturally, but this topic was also raised.
We explained what was going on there and generally spoke about this topic. No decision has been taken as of yet. The case is currently being tried in court. We have to wait until it is finished. After that we will make a decision. The key is to make sure it is disengaged from the Ukrainian election campaign so that such processes are not related to the internal political agenda in Ukraine.
As far as the New START treaty is concerned, we instructed our foreign affairs departments (Mr Lavrov on our side and Mr Pompeo on the US side) to launch consultations on these questions. I do not know yet if those consultations will lead to the extension of the New START treaty, it is too early to speak about it, but we talked about this issue.
Question: What are your impressions of the meeting in general?
Vladimir Putin: It was a good meeting. Very business-like and pragmatic. We have covered practically the entire range of issues of mutual interest. By the way, it also included our economic relations. It was agreed that they are unsatisfactory. We once again pointed at the US business community’s interest in enhancing economic relations with Russia.
I drew the US President’s attention to the fact that the US delegation was one of the biggest at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum: there were over 500 members in the delegation, I think 550 people. So it gives us food for thought. We reasserted readiness to establish a respective structure made up of business communities’ representatives to study issues of further developing our trade and economic relations. We naturally talked about the situations in various regions of the world. Overall, those were useful consultations.
Please, go ahead.
Question: Good afternoon.
We saw yesterday the beginning of your meeting with Theresa May. It was impossible to miss the attitude she displayed during the handshake. But we certainly remember the statement that relations with Russia cannot be revived unless Russia fulfils certain conditions. Yet the meeting did take place.
What did you talk about? Was this meeting necessary at all considering that Ms May is about to step down? Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Regarding this meeting, the Prime Minister did indeed ask questions about Mr Skripal. They were prompted due to the fact that your colleagues from The Financial Times raised this issue again and I had to answer it. This provoked a return to the issue.
The Prime Minister indeed takes a very tough stance on this matter. We talked about it and clarified our positions. However, I still think that common sense must prevail. I am confident that we need to restore full-scale relations; this was also what the UK businesspeople spoke about when I met with them just recently in Moscow. None of the British companies left, are leaving or will leave the Russian market. In fact, they want to step up cooperation. This is why the politicians’ task is at least not to hamper the development of a normal situation, and it will be better if they support these positive trends.
Whether the meeting was needed or not, I think that it was, because why not? Yes, she is about to step down but, firstly, today she is the current head of government. And secondly, even a small step in the positive direction is never wasted.
Go ahead, please.
Question: You have just had talks with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, thus my question: did you agree on what should be done with the OPEC+ deal and will you extend the oil production cuts and for how long? In October you are going to Saudi Arabia – at least your aide said so recently. What other agreements are you planning to make during that visit to Saudi Arabia? I take it you also spoke about it with the Crown Prince.
Vladimir Putin: Regarding the future visit, preparations for it are currently underway, so it is too early to speak about the questions that may be resolved during that visit.
As for today’s meeting with the Crown Prince, we did discuss the possibility of extending our agreements with OPEC regarding oil production cuts. I want to inform you that it may have a certain importance for the market; we agreed to extend the agreements, or at any rate we will support extending the agreements, both Russia and Saudi Arabia. By the way, the cuts will be in the previously agreed volume. As to for how long, we will have to think about it, whether for another six or nine months – maybe up to nine months.
Question: As was mentioned earlier, we all saw Theresa May’s very stern face as she met you yesterday. She said that it was impossible to have a different relationship with Russia unless Russia chooses a different path. I’d like to hear what your response to her was. Is Russia, as Mrs May says, ready to stop its external attacks, its aggression, its meddling in elections, and to take a different path, not only to improve relations with Britain, but also with the rest of the West?
Vladimir Putin: I have great news for you: we never had any intentions to commit any aggressive acts towards anybody. It is an illusion, wishful thinking, and what is wished for is to have an external adversary whose presence helps solve domestic policy issues. We have no aggressive intentions towards anybody.
Yes, I can confirm what I have already said. The Prime Minister acted at our meeting the way she described publicly. She expressed her position in a fairly tough form. Yes, it is true, that is the way it was. I informed her of Russia’s position on a number of issues that act as irritants in our relations.
I would like to draw you attention to the fact that our actions with respect to our partners will always be mirror-like: we will offer them the same attitude as they show towards us. I want everyone to remember that.
Go ahead, please.
Question: As we have learnt, the Iran issue was discussed during your meeting with Mr Trump. Did you talk about Iran’s presence in Syria? We have noticed the presence of your envoy for Syria here. This is a sensitive issue for the Americans.
Also, did you discuss the situation in Idlib during today’s meeting with Mr Erdogan? The Syrian and Turkish armies exchanged fire yesterday; the escalation reached a new high. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: We maintain constant dialogue with our US partners; we have established good contacts on the ground, as they say, to coordinate our actions and efforts to fight terrorism. There are some hotbeds there, and I told the President about the latest joint actions – well, not joint actions but rather coordinating those actions. So there was no need for us to immerse into the details at the level of presidents. This is being done rather successfully at the operational working level.
As for our Turkish partners and friends, we work with them on a daily basis, even more closely than with the Americans, so that we know about all the developments there and are trying to monitor them together. We also discussed this problem. However, there are some details that should not be disclosed at today’s news conference but the situation is under control.
Please, go ahead.
Question: Could you tell us please about the meeting with Angela Merkel, whether you discussed the resumption of the Normandy format, and if you did, what did you decide on?
Vladimir Putin: Yes, we spoke about that, and we agreed to continue to employ this format further. We spoke about some items on the bilateral agenda and on continuing work in the Normandy format. I generally agree with the Chancellor that we must use all instruments, and there are actually not so many of them, and the Normandy format is one of the functioning ones. Yes, we will keep working, the question is when, as the timeframe must be agreed on, and in which order: whether we should first have consultations with just two or three of us and then get all four parties together. Basically, yes, but the details must be worked out by our aides and foreign ministries.
Question: Good afternoon, Mr President.
I would like to ask a domestic question although it has also become international since it has to do with investments in our country. Journalist Ivan Golunov’s case was unfolding in Moscow during the St Petersburg Economic Forum. It became possible to prevent this injustice committed by the law enforcement agencies thanks to the involvement of Presidential Executive Office, but especially of the public.
Now, also during an economic summit, a criminal case was filed against Sergei Petrov, owner of Rolf, a large car dealership. I am sure you know him because he is a former politician and was even a State Duma deputy, a constructive opposition member. Can we also talk about injustice in this case, in Sergei Petrov’s case, considering the precedents from law enforcement agencies? Could you also take this case under your control? Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: The situation with Golunov was not injustice; it was lawlessness. It was plain lawlessness. And it must be investigated, and appropriate measures should be taken.
As for Mr Petrov, I know nothing about this case; this is the first time I heard about it. I have been here, and, as you say, it happened in Moscow. This is not the kind of information that is reported to me online. I am not familiar with him, I know nothing about his business and I cannot comment in any way, whether it is fair or unfair. Obviously, law enforcement agencies should continue their work and thwart any illegal activities. But I cannot tell you anything about this particular case. Of course, I cannot take under control all cases like that. But I promise you that I will request the necessary information.
Go ahead, please.
Question: Mr President, you have given an extensive overview of different topics. A short time after you last met with Donald Trump, the Americans introduced new sanctions against Russia. Could you tell if you received some reassurances from Donald Trump that no new sanctions will follow this time, or do you think sanctions may be imposed again? Or are you confident that there will no more sanctions?
Vladimir Putin: I have no idea. This is not our business; it is up to the United States to think about how they should build relations with Russia. I think we have mutual understanding that we should somehow get out of the situation that has emerged so far. But this is the same as with our colleagues and partners from the UK. It is an abnormal situation, it must be simply rectified; we must somehow find the strength to turn the page, to move on and to look to the future. It is the same in relations with the United States.
I told you that we reasserted our wish to support the business community’s proposal regarding tools for the support of business initiatives. But it shows that the incumbent Administration has intentions to somehow continue with this abnormal situation. I spoke about our trade with the United States and with some other partners. Obviously, $25 billion in trade does not meet our interests and does not reflect our potential.
That is why I have no idea if they will do anything or not. At any rate, one thing is sure – we are not going to ask for anything. No means no. And if there is interest, we will respond in kind and will do everything we can to turn the situation around.
Let me reiterate, I meet with US businesspeople, including at the St Petersburg Economic Forum. 550 people went there. They want to work. That means jobs, that means goals the President of the United State is trying to achieve. I actually said in that interview that after the globalisation processes led to such big growth of the world economy, even the middle class in the United States felt they were left behind. While large corporation made huge profits, their management got a lot of advantages as did their partners, the middle class did not, not very much. Wages remained the same, and the standard of living began to grow a little. Jobs are needed and conditions to raise real incomes of US citizens. To achieve that they need to expand cooperation and work with everyone, including Russia.
They restricted the operation of their companies in the Russian market. We made calculations across some European countries, and it really amounts to lost profits. Cutting exports (our imports are their exports) amounts to tens of billions of euros. That means jobs, either job cuts or jobs that were not created. The same applies to the United States. I hope that sanity will prevail in the end.
Question: Just now on the summit sidelines, Emmanuel Macron replied to my question if he comes to Moscow for Victory Day by saying that he definitely will. Was there a clear indication from Donald Trump if he does? Who else did you invite?
Vladimir Putin: We believe the 75th anniversary of Victory over Nazism is the most important event in the world if only because by remembering such events we must do everything possible so that nothing of the kind happens again. And if we consign it to oblivion, the threat of renewed large-scale conflicts will increase. The world is explosive even today. We talk about it a great deal and you yourselves always record and confirm it.
But it is not up to us if they come or not. Our business is to invite them. We respect our partners, and we always underscore the role and significance of our allies during the years of fighting Nazism. By the way, we think of the German underground anti-Nazi fighters in Germany as our allies too. This is why we will be happy if our invitation is accepted. If not, it is not critical. We will celebrate this date in a proper way in any case.
Question: Did you discuss Nord Stream with Mr Trump?
And while you were at the summit here in Japan, Mr Zelensky addressed you, he recorded an address. He was very agitated, he did not demand but asked you to return the Ukrainian sailors. He was angry at his foreign minister: he said that Mr Klimkin allegedly turned down Russia’s proposal to return the sailors right away. Is it true that we are ready to do it now if there was such a note from the Russian Foreign Ministry? And is it true that we were invited back to PACE in exchange for a promise that these people will be released? This is also information from Mr Klimkin, so I do not know.
Vladimir Putin: No, PACE and the Ukrainian sailors have nothing to do with that. What I would like to draw your attention to is that the newly appointed Chief of General Staff of the Ukrainian Army confirmed that it was a provocation masterminded by Poroshenko to boost his election campaign. It is absolutely ridiculous, it is an outrage. Let us proceed from that.
Given this, the Ukrainian side has in fact acknowledged that it was a provocation on their part. We will resolve this issue quietly and efficiently. We have questions regarding some people who were arrested in Ukraine, apart from those sailors. They were following an order and that was it, we are aware of that, but they broke the Russian law. This is why all that must be quietly and efficiently sorted out.
Meanwhile, exchanges go ahead. Quite recently I was told that the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics released four people with Mr Medvedchuk’s mediation. This is a good example of work, direct contact with the people who should be engaged in dialogue. If the current authorities build up the work in this direction, we will be able to achieve a lot.
Question: You have already mentioned the recent interview with the Financial Times. It has been widely quoted and broadly discussed, especially regarding your feelings towards liberalism. There were those who agree with that and those who disagree, even the famous singer Elton John argued with you, accusing you of hypocrisy. The interview was also discussed here, at the summit, if I am not mistaken. Mr Tusk, Mr Juncker, and I think Mr Macron even talked to you about it.
As other politicians and leaders expressed their opinions, did they support you or, on the contrary, did they argue with you about the liberal idea? Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, to be honest, it was totally unexpected for me that an interview – which I saw to be routine, ordinary, something passing, in which I did not think I said anything new – should stir such great interest. Some colleagues – I will not be giving their names now – indeed discussed the issues raised in the interview. Some of them supported me on the whole, others opposed and debated with me. So, yes, it did happen.
So you see the point? If we go back to the G20, it is an economic forum. The issues of liberal policy, attitude towards migration and so on were raised here. But regarding the economy, there are debates between the Peoples’ Republic of China and the United States on trade issues, with China being blamed, among other things, for subsidies to industries.
But if we want to discuss the problem of subsidising industries, let us talk about agricultural subsidies, which are very common in the European Union. If this policy continues, a policy that shuts down the market of agricultural products, or, theoretically speaking, keeps the market closed to goods from developing countries, then a question prompts itself: how can the economies of those countries be developed?
The question is: what is the best way for us to unblock discussions within the WTO, and would it not be a better option to direct part of the subsidies to supporting agriculture in the developing countries so as to provide them with jobs? What do our colleagues want? To open the market for the goods that may appear in this case, or to open the borders for migrants? But something will have to be done, either this or that. This is what I was talking about in the interview, in part.
There are other issues related to that liberal idea. This idea is multifaceted, and I do not question its attractiveness on the whole, but look at the migration I have just mentioned. You see, how can one imagine that in some European countries parents are told that “Girls should not wear skirts to school for safety reasons.” What is that? Listen, people are living in their own country in their own culture. What is that? How did it get so far? This is what I was talking about.
It has gotten too far, in my view, that this, liberal idea starts destroying itself. Millions of people live their own lives whereas those who promote those ideas, they seem to be living in their own paradigm. This is what I was saying. I don’t see anything special about it that I had not talked about earlier.
Or, you brought up the example of Elton John. I have deep respect for him, he is a genius of a musician. In reality he comes to Russia, and we all really enjoy listening to him. I think he is mistaken. I did not give a different slant to anything here; it is true that we really have a very calm attitude towards the LGBT community. Truly, it is calm and absolutely unbiased.
We have a law that everybody has been kicking us for – a law prohibiting homosexual propaganda among minors. But listen, let a person grow up, become an adult and then to decide who he or she is. Leave children in peace. There are so many inventions nowadays. I also said in that interview that they invented five or six genders, transformers, trans…
You see, I do not even understand what it is.
This is not the problem. The problem is that this part of society is aggressively imposing their view on the majority. We have to be more loyal to each other, more open and transparent. I did not say anything unusual. We have to respect everyone, that is true, but we must not impose our points of view on others. Meanwhile, representatives of the so-called liberal idea are simply forcing their ideas on others. They dictate the need for the so-called sex education. Parents are against it, and they are practically imprisoned for that. This is what I was talking about.
We are aware of what is going on. The question was related to the way we assess the situation in our partners’ countries, I think. Yes, people are fed up with that, and this may actually account for the Trump phenomenon, when he won the election, and people’s discontent underlies it in many countries of Western Europe, when they walk out into the streets.
This is the point. Meanwhile, everyone is looking for the reasons somewhere far away and trying to blame Russia for what is happening there. Do we have anything to do with it? Yes, there are certain polemics in the information sphere, and we have expressed our point of view about it. Don’t they do it themselves? Of course, they do, all the time. We are not making noise or getting hysterical about their constant interference in our affairs, even though their interference is present on a daily basis. But this is what has been established, the practice of international relations, unfortunately. I wish this did not happen. But there are deep reasons and they do not want to admit them. That is what I said about. I think I said nothing new because I have talked about it a number of times before.
Thank you very much.
