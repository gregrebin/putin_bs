President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
The 6th Eastern Economic Forum opened yesterday, and I think it has firmly taken its dignified place in the international calendar of events of this kind. It is an interesting and useful platform for our partners who are joining us during this event in Vladivostok and us – Russian businesses and officials from different levels of government. It is a meaningful event, since it allows us to analyse what has been done in the region, in this vast Far Eastern region of Russia, during the period under review and to outline – jointly – which is important – further actions to develop the region.
This is vital for the local people and the authorities, which can demonstrate what they are capable of, as well as for businesses in order for them to start or continue interesting and promising projects which, I hope, are satisfying to them and help implement, in the best sense of the word, their ambitions and are also lucrative, which is important.
I am aware that you started working yesterday and, frankly speaking, I decided to use this meeting to get as much information from you as possible about yesterday’s work. I would like you to bring me up to speed on the most important and interesting topics that you covered.
Of course, for my part, I will do my best to satisfy your interest in the matters that you discussed yesterday and which you would like to talk about at this meeting as well. To be quite honest, I need your support now to update me on matters that you believe are most important, most interesting and promising for your further activities during the forum in general.
Let's get down to work.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
Mr Tokayev, friends,
Today, we have a very positive and important event on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum. Kazakhstan and Sber, a Russian group, are signing a Memorandum of Cooperation on the digital transformation of public administration in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
First of all, I would like to thank the President of Kazakhstan in person. I am aware that Mr Tokayev personally oversees matters of this kind, and pays a lot of attention to modern high technology. We have discussed this subject with you on a number of occasions, and I would like to thank you for choosing a Russian company as a strategic partner. I know that the President was involved in the decision made by the Government of Kazakhstan to choose Sber’s offer as the best option. This reaffirms once again that one of our leading digital companies is effective and relevant, including on the international markets.
In fact, Sber has been working for more than 15 years in Kazakhstan on financial and digital services and technology. Today’s ceremony marks another step in reinforcing this cooperation.
Sber will supply software for digitising public services as part of this project. By the way, it has been quite effective in Russia. I really hope that the cooperation that is about to take off will be fruitful and will yield tangible results, further strengthening the comprehensive creative partnership between our countries and peoples.
I wish you every success!
Thank you very much.

(The Agreement of Intent on the Implementation of the Second Phase of the Udokan Copper Deposit Development Project, the Agreement of Intent on Building Methanol-Powered Ships at Russian Shipyards, the Agreement on the Creation of the Far Eastern Children’s Recreation and Health Centre in the Khabarovsk Territory, and the Agreement on the Implementation of the Investment Project of the Comprehensive Development of Fisheries Logistics in Russia were signed).
Vladimir Putin: I would like to comment on what is happening.
An entire range of important agreements and memorandums are traditionally signed on the sidelines of the forum. We just witnessed the signing of a series of such agreements, among them the Agreement of Intent on the Implementation of the Second Stage of the Udokan Copper Deposit Development Project, aimed at multiplying the ore throughput. Some 289 billion rubles will be invested in this promising project and over 2,000 new jobs will be created
It is crucially important to develop the social sphere, including the infrastructure for children’s recreation and resorts in the Far East. As we just saw, the trilateral agreement to establish such a centre in the Khabarovsk Territory was signed. The total cost of the construction will be some 2.3 billion rubles. It will accommodate 300–350 children per one session who will be able to recreate, improve their health and take part in interesting educational programmes. It’s really a wonderful project.
The memorandum on building methanol-powered vessels is also worth noting. The parties to this agreement are the Ministry for the Development of the Russian Far East and Arctic, VTB Bank, VEB, ESN Group, as well as representatives of the Japanese companies Mitsui and Marubeni.
The Agreement on the Comprehensive Development of Fisheries Logistics in Russia is also important. It was signed between VEB, the Corporation for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic and the managing company of Ryba Corporation. A total of 52 billion rubles will be invested in the project. Over the next three years, three fishing sea ports will be renovated: in Murmansk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and the Sakhalin Region. In addition, plans call for building a new fishing port on Cape Nazimov in Vladivostok. Their joint cargo turnover will reach 4.6 million tonnes.
I would like to emphasise that the efficient development of the economic and tourism potential and the exploration of the unique natural resources of the Far East and other regions is our common priority task. It is important to combine the efforts of the state and businesses in reaching this goal.
Colleagues,
I hope that all agreements that were signed today will be implemented in full and will facilitate the economic growth of the regions and improve the quality of life of our citizens.
I would like to wish all those present here success and all the best.

Ceremony to launch Gazprom helium hub
The President took part in the ceremony to launch Gazprom’s helium hub in Vladivostok, via videoconference.
September 3, 2021
09:00
Russky Island, Primorye Territory
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: The Amur Gas Processing Plant is a major and very important project. I would like to say a few words to begin with.
Today we are opening an advanced helium tank logistics centre. Mr Miller and I spoke about this in detail just a couple of days ago. Just recently, the second production line and a helium liquefaction facility were launched at the Amur Gas Processing Plant. These are two of Gazprom’s large closely connected projects, with the helium hub in Vladivostok to receive helium from the Amur Plant and further deliver it to consumers.
I would like to thank all those involved in setting up and developing such cutting-edge production facilities of national importance. I know that the work is conducted actively, consistently and responsibly. The plant’s first production line was launched just recently, in June. The launch of the second production line is a major new step towards boosting the company’s capacities. We should preserve this high dynamic, which is actually required for all projects we are implementing both in the Far East and across the country.
Upon reaching its full operating capacity in 2025, the Amur Gas Processing Plant is expected to become the world’s largest complex to produce helium – a gas that is required by many high-tech industries. The plant will provide helium to domestic consumers and will allow Russia to take leading positions as a major helium supplier in the global market. As I said, the logistics hub in Vladivostok will play a crucial role here, with helium to be exported to other countries, including in the Asia-Pacific Region.
The construction of the first and so far the only helium hub in the country has become another considerable achievement by our specialists. The project gave an impetus to other advanced technologies to emerge, and generated orders for a number of related industries: for instance, a series of unique LPG-fuelled tractor trucks was built and launched into production together with KamAZ. Such prospective projects make a considerable contribution to the Russian regions’ economic and social development and create new highly qualified jobs. And, of course, we will further create conditions for launching such advanced facilities, carry out modernisation of our industry and improve the quality of raw material processing in accordance with the strictest environmental standards.
Friends, colleagues, thank you once again for your work and achievements. I wish you every success.
(Addressing Alexei Miller.) Please, go ahead.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller: Mr President,
Building up the capacities of the Amur Gas Processing Plant is synchronised with increasing gas volumes from the Power of Siberia pipeline. On June 9, you launched the production at the first gas processing complex and today we start work along the entire technological chain – from the production site via a helium hub to end consumers.
The plant’s capacity is 60 million cubic metres of gas. It is the largest production facility in the world, and it will cover a third of the world’s helium demand. Russia and Gazprom will become leaders in the global helium market.
This is a modern plant with high-tech equipment that ensures nearly 100 percent helium purity.
The helium hub is located 1,500 kilometres from the Amur Gas Processing Plant. Insulated containers can only be transported by road or sea transport to avoid shocks and impacts. A special service structure has been set up to this end to service 50 KamAZ tractor trucks. These trucks have a pneumatic suspension and operate on liquefied natural gas.
The helium hub will perform over 4,000 operations with insulated containers per year. Meanwhile, there are only 2,000 containers to transport liquid helium throughout the world. Therefore, today we are launching the first helium hub in Russia which is the biggest in the world
(Reports were also made by Gazprom Pererabotka Blagoveshchensk CEO Yury Lebedev and Gazprom Helium Service CEO Lyubov Brish.)
Alexei Miller: Mr President, I ask you to give the command to launch the helium hub.
Vladimir Putin: Begin.
Varvara Semyonova: Helium hub dispatcher Varvara Semyonova reporting.
All equipment is operating normally. Opening the valves.
The pressure and temperature are normal, liquid nitrogen and helium are passing into the insulated container preparation station.
Alexei Miller: Mr President,
Russia’s first and the world’s biggest helium hub has become operational.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Miller, colleagues.
My congratulations again.
The company has been progressing very successfully in diverse areas. And it is not just the production figures or natural gas sales in the domestic market, although the company has reached record-setting results in these crucial areas. But it matters even more that the company pays due attention to high technology, looks for new niches in the domestic and world markets and successfully resolves these issues thanks to your talent and hard work.
Thank you very much and all the best.
My congratulations on today’s achievement!
