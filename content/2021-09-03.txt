President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
The 6th Eastern Economic Forum opened yesterday, and I think it has firmly taken its dignified place in the international calendar of events of this kind. It is an interesting and useful platform for our partners who are joining us during this event in Vladivostok and us – Russian businesses and officials from different levels of government. It is a meaningful event, since it allows us to analyse what has been done in the region, in this vast Far Eastern region of Russia, during the period under review and to outline – jointly – which is important – further actions to develop the region.
This is vital for the local people and the authorities, which can demonstrate what they are capable of, as well as for businesses in order for them to start or continue interesting and promising projects which, I hope, are satisfying to them and help implement, in the best sense of the word, their ambitions and are also lucrative, which is important.
I am aware that you started working yesterday and, frankly speaking, I decided to use this meeting to get as much information from you as possible about yesterday’s work. I would like you to bring me up to speed on the most important and interesting topics that you covered.
Of course, for my part, I will do my best to satisfy your interest in the matters that you discussed yesterday and which you would like to talk about at this meeting as well. To be quite honest, I need your support now to update me on matters that you believe are most important, most interesting and promising for your further activities during the forum in general.
Let's get down to work.
