Address at the New Era of Journalism: Farewell to Mainstream international media forum
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I would like to begin by congratulating the Rossiya Segodnya team on the upcoming special occasion, the Agency’s 75th anniversary.
The Agency began its history in June 1941 as the legendary Sovinformburo, which opened two days after the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, unfailingly supplying the latest reports from the battlegrounds. Millions of people in this country, the Soviet Union, and throughout the world found hope and faith in the eventual defeat of the common enemy, the Nazis, listening to the unforgettable voice of Yury Levitan.
Sovinformburo was later transformed into the Novosti Press Agency, then RIA Novosti and finally the Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency. Over the years, they represented our country in the international media space, always working to provide prompt and complete news updates. Over the past few years, Rossiya Segodnya correspondents have won prestigious international and Russian awards in photography, broadcast journalism, design and social projects.
Once again, I would like to say that your media group is rapidly developing a system of modern editorial centers abroad (as your director has just shown me), offering your audience their content in various formats and in more than 30 languages; there are such bureaus in 32 countries now. Every day, the flagship Rossiya Segodnya website works as a reliable source of news for two million people, which puts this resource at the very top among Russian-language news resources in terms of audience size.
I sincerely wish the Rossiya Segodnya team to keep up their exceptional performance and to maintain and develop the rich traditions of Russian journalism. I would also like to thank all the Russian and foreign participants of the forum for their valuable input and cooperation.
In the modern world, with information technologies developing so rapidly, your most important job remains to achieve information integrity, truthfulness and unbiased reporting.
As I know, you have spent two days discussing a variety of issues, especially the role of the media in the changing world, exchanged opinions, concerns and problems. A direct conversation between colleagues is always useful. Today's media landscape is strewn with acute, complex issues that certainly need to be addressed and dealt with.
You spoke during the forum about what journalism is today. Yet, it is something that does not change all that much from one day to another; in essence, journalism is a quest for the truth. In the modern world, with information technologies developing so rapidly, your most important job remains to achieve information integrity and truthfulness, and as I said earlier, unbiased reporting. These are the most important things.
It is certainly important for the authorities in all countries to ensure the freedom of information. I believe that many of us in this room would agree that the situation must not be allowed when authorities protect the information they like, and then they cite the freedom of information and freedom of the press, while dismissing things they do not like as propaganda of certain political groups or campaigns for the interests of specific countries. Information should be objective in every respect and not be subjected to any repressive action or tampered with.
Back to Rossiya Segodnya, I very much hope that your agency will continue, as it has in previous years, its objective coverage of domestic and international politics, of the Russian economy as an attractive investment destination, and of our rich multi-ethnic culture while at the same time presenting your audience with a wide scope of opinions and perspectives.
I would like to thank you again and congratulate you on your upcoming anniversary.
Thank you.

Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu with his spouse visited the Bolshoi Theatre to watch a gala concert by Bolshoi Theatre and Israeli Opera performers, dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the resumption of diplomatic relations between Russia and Israel.
Address before the concert dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the resumption of Russian-Israeli diplomatic relations
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, friends,
Today, we are celebrating in a festive atmosphere the 25th anniversary of the resumption of Russian-Israeli diplomatic relations. During today’s very friendly and meaningful talks, Mr Netanyahu and I stressed that Russia and Israel can take pride in our high level of partnership, fruitful all-round cooperation and far-reaching business contacts.
There is also something greater that links our countries together. Mr Netanyahu and I talked about it just before we entered this hall and came on stage. This is the profound interpenetration of cultures and traditions, shared pages of history, and hundreds of thousands of human fates.
We in Russia greatly appreciate that Israel remembers what role the Soviet Union played in the establishment of contemporary Jewish statehood and that it was among the first to recognise that country and exchange diplomatic missions with it.
There were many emigrants from the then Russian Empire and the Soviet Union among the founders of Israel and its present-day leaders. Close to 1.5 million Israelis have Russian ancestry, and the Russian language is one of the widest-spoken in Israel.
Outstanding Israeli writer and journalist Amos Oz wrote: “The connection of Jews with Russia – fundamental, spiritual, cultural and literary – is determined, among other factors, by the similarity of temperament.” These words stress again the historical, human and cultural profundity of contacts between our countries and peoples.
We cannot imagine Russian literature without Isaak Babel and Boris Pasternak, poetry without Osip Mandelstam and Joseph Brodsky, and ballet without Maya Plisetskaya. It is good that mutual cultural enrichment is going on today – suffice it to mention, among others, the legendary Bolshoi Theatre, where we have gathered now.
Its company’s tour of Israel in 2013 – the first in history – was a fabulous success. The theatre managers have just told me about new interesting initiatives to develop cooperation with Israeli partners. Prominent director Yevgeny Arye will stage Weinberg’s opera The Idiot at the Bolshoi next year.
I will not speak now about the diverse political and economic contacts between Russia and Israel. I only want to express hope that our bilateral cooperation will be enriched by new initiatives this anniversary year. What matters most is that we are determined to work consistently and rhythmically, and implement all our plans.
I wish you and us every success. Thank you for your attention.
