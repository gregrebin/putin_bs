President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today we are holding yet another meeting of the permanent members of the Russian Security Council and will focus on a very important and sensitive issue. I am referring to neutralising threats to the national security of our country related to the development of artificial intelligence technology for military purposes in the leading armies of the world.
