Meeting with Constitutional Court judges.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
Following the tradition, we meet with you on the occasion of the Constitution Day that we mark on December 12. The Constitution was adopted 22 years ago, and next year we will mark the 25th anniversary of the Constitutional Court.
There is no need for me to stress yet again the importance of this institution – the Constitutional Court. The only thing I would like to point out today is that the entire building of Russian legislation hinges on the way you work, the way you interpret the Constitution, and this is extremely important.
I will not talk right now about your current work – you've considered 33 cases this year, if I am correct, so that's a lot of work. Besides, you have switched over to electronic submission of documents meaning that you are improving, keeping up with the times, and this gives our citizens additional access to the Constitutional Court’s capabilities.
And a very important thing is the decision made by Russia’s legislators giving the Constitutional Court the right to make a relevant decision regarding the activities of the European Court of Human Rights as far as it concerns Russia and Russian legislation. These are extremely important things. You and I know that we did not create anything new here; many European countries actually share the same path.
And it was pleasing to hear that you had a meeting with your colleagues from the European Court of Human Rights. Today I would like to hear more about this meeting, what was discussed there and what joint decisions you have come to with your European colleagues.
I want to congratulate you on the Constitution Day and wish you all the very best.

Meeting with UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova
Vladimir Putin met with Director-General of UNESCO Irina Bokova on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Cultural Forum.

With UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Bokova,
We met exactly a year ago, and just now in your speech [at the plenary session of the St Petersburg International Cultural Forum] you mentioned that that meeting was held in connection with the State Hermitage Museum anniversary. Now we mark UNESCO's anniversary.
It is good to know that we have business-like and very friendly relations with the specialised agencies of the United Nations, including UNESCO. We have always supported and intend to further support your work.
We are thankful to you for taking part in the events organised in Russia and for speaking highly of our efforts to support culture.
I want to reassure you that this is one of the key areas in our work though we are aware that what we do is not enough. We count on your support and assistance in the future.
UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova: Thank you, Mr President. Thank you for your kind words about UNESCO.
Naturally, it is an enormous honour to celebrate our organisation’s 70th anniversary with you here in St Petersburg. And this cultural forum was confirmed as one of the most important forums, addressing problems in culture and creating cultural heritage.
We can see how important these issues are today, politically speaking. You yourself talked about why cultural heritage is important, how we must preserve it, particularly in conflict zones where we see destruction, such as Syria, Iraq and other nations.
I am particularly grateful to you for Russia’s initiative to submit Resolution No. 2199, which we discussed before submission, to the Security Council. And you included preservation of heritage and the need to stop unlawful trafficking of items of cultural value that are then used to finance extremism among the problems to be addressed.
We have developed cooperation with Russia in the field of science, with 56 UNESCO departments, which is the highest number of UNESCO departments. We have many documents that are included in other programmes. We are cooperating in the field of education, new technologies, and communications. We are creating a science council and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spent an entire day in St Petersburg on the Russian Academy of Sciences’ invitation, so we could say that we have full-scale cooperation.
I want to once again thank you for the invitation to join you to celebrate UNESCO’s 70th anniversary here in St Petersburg.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your visit.

Speech at ceremony closing the Year of Literature and opening the Year of Russian Cinema.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, good evening,
The first day of the IV St Petersburg International Cultural Forum timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of UNESCO is coming to its end on the beautiful new stage of the Mariinsky Theatre. Here today we see many prominent representatives of Russia's culture and art, many talented people, talented young people, and foreign star guests. Such concentration of unique talents, inspiration, intellect, selfless devotion and artistry create a special atmosphere, filling it with the light of spirituality, goodness, perfection and creative generosity.
These are the top values that the culture opens up to humanity, and they will without a doubt be the guiding light for the forum's work. It's symbolic that the forum's events are taking place between two major events in Russia's cultural life – we are launching the Year of Russian Cinema and closing the Year of Culture.

It was truly successful. Of course, this is too short a time to fully resolve the problems of increasing the quality in teaching the Russian language, literature, developing our school of literary translation, including from the languages of Russia’s ethnic groups, which is certainly lacking today in our lives, schools and universities. It is impossible to increase young people’s interest in reading, in good book in that short a period.
But we have done a great deal and will certainly continue working in these areas beyond the Year of Literature. As Natalya Solzhenitsyna recently said at the Kremlin, “The Year of Literature in Russia should never really end.” This is absolutely right and this is what we will strive for. The most important thing we saw is that people are interested in and excited about these topics.
The National State Radio and Television Broadcasting Company just completed a unique educational project: nearly 1,500 people of different ages and professions read from Leo Tolstoy’s great novel, War and Peace, in a live broadcast.
And this project, this broadcast, turned out to be staggeringly popular. Meanwhile, this summer, the Books of Russia festival was held on Red Square. Here are some interesting data I will share with you: during the three days of the festival its visitors purchased half a million books, published by three hundred publishing houses from fifty of Russia’s regions.
I do not doubt that the upcoming Year of Russian Cinema will be just as interesting, bright and creative, and will be another step toward consolidating high moral principles and aesthetic tastes in our society. We will remember all the great achievements of our cinematography and attempt to find the best choices for developing the Russian film industry.
I know that the St Petersburg International Cultural Forum will address nearly all topics pertaining to culture, art, literature, cultural heritage and humanities. These issues will have enormous significance for our society and for each of us, for every person. After all, it is known that culture – in the broader sense – creates higher goals and moral ideals and leads people toward the right path in finding the purpose of life.
I want to wish participants in the forum success, fruitful work, and the best of luck. I need to do some more work, but you will have the chance to enjoy a wonderful concert and a great evening. I wish you all the best. Thank you for your attention.

Plenary session of St Petersburg International Cultural Forum

Plenary session of St Petersburg International Cultural Forum.
The IV St Petersburg International Cultural Forum is taking place on December 14–16, 2015. Every year the forum brings together experts in culture, politicians, representatives of state bodies and business people, and this year’s event is dedicated to the 70th anniversary of UNESCO.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome participants and guests in the IV International Cultural Forum honouring UNESCO’s 70th anniversary to Russia.
Following tradition, the forum is held here in St Petersburg. And the value of this city as one of the jewels of world cultural heritage is undeniable. But our Northern Capital is known for more than just its outstanding architecture and rich artistic achievements.
This is a city with a grandiose destiny that has experienced its share of triumphs and terrible trials. It remembers the enormous force of its residents’ spirit during the years of World War II and is itself a symbol of victory of life over death, the victory of human dignity over barbarity and cruelty. Here, we can feel the importance of UNESCO’s mission with a special strength: the world unites to preserve and develop humanity for the sake of the values of humanism and enlightenment.
These processes are of principal importance for Russia. Our nation was historically built as a civilisation where every ethnic group preserved its cultural identity. We are ready to share this experience of interaction between traditions, languages and cultures openly and kindly with the world; at the same time, we strive to take into account and enrich our own lives with humanity’s best achievements.
And that is why we fully share UNESCO’s principles. Today, this respected, influential organisation is literally a humanitarian buttress for the entire complex of international cooperation, a defender of the most important universal values, spiritual and moral foundations, as well as the heritage of nations and peoples.
We are grateful to UNESCO for its constructive cooperation and assistance in resolving key issues in developing Russian education, science, culture and information sector. In turn, the majority of UNESCO projects are implemented with Russian support.
We actively cooperate in implementing programmes to preserve global heritage, cultural diversity and ethnic identity. Together, we work to strengthen intercultural dialogue, develop the foundations of scientific and technical progress, and ensure journalists’ safety.
We are prepared to further build up our partnership with UNESCO and see prospects for joint work in important areas such as ensuring sustainable development for modern civilisation and improving international relations.
Today, the entire global community is facing serious challenges and threats such as terrorism, growing intolerance, xenophobia and social problems. The fields of communications and information exchange require particular attention. Modern technologies have not only opened up unprecedented opportunities for communication and access to knowledge, but unfortunately, are also used as an instrument of manipulation to negatively affect people’s minds and souls. It is our common objective to withstand these destructive processes.
UNESCO programmes aimed at humanizing the information environment, filling the global information space with high-quality scientific and cultural content, as well as educational and information resources, are very much needed. Russia is prepared to become an active participant in such programmes.
We have clearly stated our position on preserving and protecting global cultural heritage, first and foremost in conflict zones where unique historical monuments are being savagely plundered and destroyed. We value UNESCO’s enormous contribution to implementing the UN Security Council resolution initiated by Russia, banning trade in antiquities and items of cultural value.
We know that money raised from this criminal business, as well as the sale of drugs and stolen oil is, among other things, used to finance terrorists and extremist activities. We expect that the global community will be able to join forces to cut off these funding channels to bandits.
UNESCO’s desire to turn culture and cultural diversity into a powerful instrument for sustainable development and thus implement the agenda recently adopted by the UN General Assembly in this area through to 2030 deserves particular attention.
The organisation has not only achieved recognition of the role of cultural factors in social, economic and other areas of life in the global community, but also promoted integration of culture in nine of the seventeen goals for sustainable development.
Another area of UNESCO’s activity that we find particularly significant is developing the fundamental sciences. This is another field for our joint work.
It is significant that the session of the Scientific Advisory Board of the UN Secretary-General is being held in St Petersburg at the same time as our forum. It’s a kind of ‘Council of the Wise’ called upon to develop scientifically founded recommendations on the most significant questions in modern life, from global development and the role of science in making political decisions to climate change issues.
In conclusion, I would like to once again stress that UNESCO and the members of this prestigious organisation will always find Russia to be an active and engaged participant in its programmes and projects.
I wish the International Cultural Forum success in its work and all its participants – good and bright impressions of their visit in St Petersburg.
Thank you for your attention.
