President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Čeferin, I am very happy to see you again.
It is not a coincidence that you are in St Petersburg. We are well aware that St Petersburg is among the12 European cities chosen to host UEFA Cup matches next year. And this will be a special tournament since it will coincide with the 60th anniversary of the championships, European football championships. It carries a lot of meaning for us because when the first championship was held 60 years ago, the winner was the national team of the Soviet Union.
Russia has been a UEFA member since its founding in 1954, if I am not mistaken. And our representatives are involved in most of its committees and commissions.
Mr President, while in Nizhny Novgorod, you praised Russia’s abilities to prepare and hold large-scale international competitions. We will do our best not to let you down, not to disappoint the fans and players.
President of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Alexander Čeferin: Thank you very much for inviting me, Mr President. It is an honour, it is a pleasure, not just because St Petersburg is one of the 12 cities, but also because there is a very important match of Zenit St Petersburg here tonight. We will go to see the Champions’ League match.
We are at UEFA very happy that Russia is more and more a football country. And I must say that the World Cup was organised perfectly. I am not much of a diplomat, and those two guys know that I do not just speak to be nice, but I really mean it. It was organised perfectly, and I am sure you are capable of organising top events in the future.
Thank you very much again, especially because I know that your schedule is unbelievable, for taking some time to meet tonight.
Vladimir Putin: You are correct in pointing out that football’s popularity is growing in our country. It has been and remains the most popular sport. But its popularity is growing indeed. Today, according to our estimates, about 3 million of our people are connected with football one way or another. And the surge in popularity is linked, among other things, with hosting such large events as the FIFA World Cup, for example.

Meeting with World Economic Forum Executive Chairman Klaus Martin Schwab
During his visit to St Petersburg, Vladimir Putin met with Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Martin Schwab.
November 27, 2019

St Petersburg
The meeting was attended by Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin
.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Schwab, please accept my sincere greetings. I am happy to see you again.
We all know the current state of the world economy. There are many problems and the number of unpredictable variables is continually on the rise.
Global GDP rates are dropping. According to the WTO, trade will probably grow by about 1.2 percent instead of the predicted 4 percent.
This is why your international venue, the Global Economic Forum, is in such demand and is of great use. It supports people striving to work openly and in line with current international law and promotes contacts between business and government officials.
This is why we have always supported and will continue to support our relations with the forum you founded. Naturally, Russian representatives have always attended and will attend your events.
In turn, we conduct similar events that are primarily aimed at establishing business contacts with Russia’s partners. You know we have the Economic Forum here in St Petersburg as well as different events in the Far East, Siberia and southern Russia. So we are following your example. I hope that we are not letting you down and that we are working in unison.
Executive Chairmanof the World Economic Forum (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for the warm reception. We are indeed linked by many years of good cooperation. It always mattered to me that Russian representatives took part in our events in Davos. It has always had a special meaning for me.
Much has changed since you last attended our forum. We are progressing, and now we have the status of an international organisation in Switzerland. Our goal, as you have already said, is to help enhance cooperation between businesspeople and state structures.
We are confident that the significant challenges we face, be it the climate and environment issues or economic growth problems, can only be resolved through cooperation, and at the global level.
I would also like to express my positive emotions after I spent two days in Moscow. Some people call me the father of the fourth industrial revolution. I wrote a book about it and would like to give it to you.
I also heard, including from Minister Oreshkin, that Russia has managed to make significant advancements, especially in striving to develop artificial intelligence. We are asking ourselves how to cope with these challenges including via global cooperation. We think that specific problems will arise in building global cooperation in the area of new technologies. We will need new global standards, new ethical norms, including in AI technology development. This is the reason why we set up a network of centres where we analyse technologies of the fourth industrial revolution.

Meeting on effect of M11 Moscow-St Petersburg motorway on socioeconomic development in regions
Following the opening ceremony of the M11 Moscow-St Petersburg motorway, the President chaired a meeting on the effect this investment project will have on the socioeconomic development in the regions.
November 27, 2019
15:00
St Petersburg
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
We are attending a pleasant and memorable event. This large infrastructure project has been completed and will have a major effect on the north western regions and the country as a whole. It will enhance the competitiveness of the regions across which the motorway runs, create new tourism opportunities and increase these regions’ investment appeal.
When I saw our French colleague [Yves-Thibault de Silguy, Deputy Chairman of the Board of the Vinci Group] here, I recalled that he took part in the signing of a memorandum in Paris in 2006, which President Chirac and I attended. It is gratifying that we not only plan but also implement such large-scale projects. This means that we achieve good results when we stay focused and work hard.
I would like to point out that this project is a positive example of public-private partnership. It has been implemented through a combination of state and private efforts and with a contribution from French and Turkish construction firms. All of them worked as a close-knit team focused on results. And we have achieved this.
I would like to ask the heads of the regions across which the motorway runs to express their opinions and say a few words about their plans. I want you to know, however, that your job is far from over, and that possibly it has just started, and here is why. The motorway should be made more driver-friendly, which is largely, no, not largely but entirely the job of the regions. The construction workers have done their job – they have built the motorway and now it should be made more driver-friendly, which is the direct responsibility of the regional authorities. The motorway must have service areas, petrol stations, restaurants and cafes, communications, the internet, and many other things. And everything must be up-to-date, just as the motorway itself.
It is clear that we have not had anything like this in the history of Russian road construction before. But, as the construction workers said, we have it now. We will proceed from the notion that this is a first and a positive experience. There are plans for constructing such motorways in other directions as well, for example towards Vladimir and further still. I believe that the minister, who will be reporting now, will tell us about this.
I would like to congratulate all of you once again on this achievement. First of all, we should thank our partners, those who did an excellent job and who completed the project. I am referring to the workers and engineers, all who had a hand in this and gave their heart, as well as their skill and professionalism to this project.
Congratulations to all of you!
<…>
Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you for your efforts and their results. I ask the Ministry and the regions’ heads to nominate people for government awards for the results of this work.
Thank you very much.
We will continue implementing our plans, taking into account, among other things, the suggestions put forth during our meeting.
Thank you.

Monument to Daniil Granin unveiled in St Petersburg
Vladimir Putin attended the unveiling of a monument to writer and public activist Daniil Granin.

Unveiling a monument to writer and public activist Daniil Granin.
A bronze sculpture has been erected on Dalnevostochny Prospekt, not far from the cultural and educational centre at the Daniil Granin Library. A monument to war-veteran writer erected by the Russian Military Historical Society.
The President laid flowers at the monument.
* * *
Speech at the unveiling ceremony
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, Mrs Chernyshova-Granina, ladies and gentlemen,
Today we are here to unveil a monument to Daniil Granin. And, as Mr Stepashin has just said, his life, the life of Daniil Granin, our outstanding compatriot and contemporary, was inextricably linked with Leningrad, now St Petersburg. As a personality, he, too, absorbed the best features of his hometown, because this city had definitely become home to him and personified a true Russian intellectual – honest, conscientious, and decent.
The works of Daniil Granin depict the events of almost the entire 20th century. An author, a war veteran, a thinker and a public figure, he has earned the recognition, love, and respect of millions of people. Yet, he never stopped in his creative and spiritual search. Like many characters of his books, he always strove for knowledge and for the truth.
The war was naturally the most intense motive in Daniil Granin’s books. He volunteered to fight at the frontline, and defended Leningrad in the most difficult, unbearable days of the siege. The heroism and suffering of the besieged city residents remained forever in his heart. Together with Ales Adamovich, he wrote A Book of The Blockade, the first evidence of those terrible years, without exaggeration, striking in its truth.
Daniil Granin was confident that justice and truth always win in the end; he understood the deep meaning of human life, called it a miracle that was to be preserved as the greatest good. He did a lot to revive the traditions of mercy and philanthropy in society; in literature, journalism, and his social activities he always upheld such values as kindness, compassion and disinterested help to people who need support and attention.
Friends, this year we mark the centenary of Daniil Granin’s birth. His life was incredibly full and diverse, and his creative and spiritual heritage is important for all of us today and, I am sure, it will be as relevant for future generations.
His books about innovative scientists obsessed with the pursuit of scientific discoveries, are acquiring a new, modern perspective today. His strong belief that the importance of humans actually increases in the era of technological breakthroughs remains relevant.
Daniil Granin always emphasised the importance of moral values, something he saw as the foundation of a healthy, cohesive society, and with his whole life, he proved the resilience of those values he upheld in his literary and journalistic work, during meetings with his readers, and with people in general. He never went back on his beliefs, generously sharing his amazing inner radiance.
Daniil Granin’s name and his services to the Fatherland definitely deserve to be immortalised in a monument. Yet, his abundant cultural heritage, his devotion to the ideas of humanism, and enlightenment, and loyalty to our country commemorate him best.
Thank you.

Keel-laying ceremony for the Nikolay Zubov icebreaker class patrol ship.
The President saw the ship’s base section to which he attached a plate with the ship’s name. The scheduled state contract deadline is November 25, 2024.
The Nikolay Zubov is a multipurpose vessel combining the qualities of a tug-boat, an ice breaker and a patrol ship capable of breaking through up to 1.5 metres of ice. The ship is designed to guard and monitor the Arctic water resources and to escort and tug seized ships to port. In addition, it can be used in convoys and to support supply ships, take part in rescue operations and move special cargo in containers on the upper deck. The ship’s area of operations will be from the tropics to the Arctic region. The ship has space reserved to deploy strike missile weapons. In addition, the ship will be equipped with a helicopter pad and a hangar to station a helicopter and drone aircraft, two speedboats and an AK-176MA automatic gun mount.
The President talked briefly with shipyard employees.
Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov
, General Director of Admiralty Shipyards Alexander Buzakov, Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu
, Vice Prime Minister Yury Borisov
, Commander of the Russian Navy Nikolay Yevmenov and President of the United Shipbuilding Corporation Alexey Rakhmanov accompanied the President on his visit.
Admiralty Shipyards is the base manufacturer in the shipbuilding sector and a non-nuclear submarine building centre in Russia. Currently the vessels under construction include two series of submarines for the Russian Navy, a series of patrol ice-breakers for the Russian Navy, a series of large refrigerator trawlers, and the North Pole ice-resistant self-propelled platform.

Speech at the keel laying ceremony for the Nikolai Zubov ice class patrol ship
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.
I am sincerely happy to welcome you and congratulate you on the keel laying of this new Russian warship, the Nikolai Zubov. This is a major event for the Navy and for Admiralty Shipyards. This company has been building ships of the most diverse classes and designations for 315 years, from sailing ships to submarines and icebreakers. It continues the cause and traditions of many generations of talented and skilled shipbuilders and upholds the glory of Russia as a great marine power.
Today we are starting the construction of the second cutting edge, unique, and powerful icebreaker class patrol ship. It is designed to serve in complicated, sometimes dangerous and unpredictable northern conditions, to effectively resolve a broad range of tasks, support merchant shipping and research on the Northern Sea Route and of course, reliably protect our border areas and Russia’s national interests in the Arctic latitudes.
Trailblazers and explorers in the Russian north, legendary polar researchers and naval officers who took on nature with their courage, valour and will, could only dream of such equipment and ships. Nikolai Zubov was one of them. He was a strong and resolute Arctic researcher. I am confident that the new ship will bear his name with honour.
I would like to emphasise that the development of the Russian Navy and all of its components has been and remains one of our priorities. We will continue to fulfill and resolve these strategic national objectives consistently and effectively. We always rely on the experience, high professionalism and well-coordinated efforts of the workers at Admiralty Shipyards and our other shipbuilders.
I sincerely wish good luck and success to all those who will build this ship: to the engineers and workers, and of course, to its future crew. As you say, fair winds and following seas! My congratulations to you.

Opening M11 Moscow-St Petersburg motorway
Vladimir Putin took part in the opening of the M11 Moscow-St Petersburg motorway and spoke briefly with the construction workers.
November 27, 2019

St Petersburg
4 of 7
With the construction workers of the M11 Moscow-St Petersburg motorway.
The M11 motorway links the Moscow Ring Road with that in St Petersburg and mostly runs parallel to the toll-free M10 Rossiya motorway, crossing it several times.
The new route will handle transit traffic, including intra-regional traffic, and the M10 Rossiya motorway will accommodate local traffic and will ensure that traffic flows at a high speed between Moscow and St Petersburg.
The motorway is 669 kilometres long.
The M11 construction project was implemented on public-private partnership principles.
While speaking with construction workers, Vladimir Putin noted that following a public vote, the new route would be called Neva.
Other attendees included Presidential Aide Igor Levitin, Minister of Transport Yevgeny Ditrikh, Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Activities, the Environment and Transport Sergei Ivanov and Chairman of the Board of the State Company Russian Highways Vyacheslav Petushenko.

Conversation with construction workers
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. I would like to congratulate all of you on this remarkable achievement. I have just seen our French colleague [Yves-Thibault de Silguy, Deputy Chairman of the Board of the Vinci Group]. I remember signing the memorandum in Paris. I was there at the ceremony together with President of France Jacques Chirac. We made our plans in 2006, and now we have implemented them. We have never had anything of this sort before in the history of Russia and of national road construction.
Remark: But we have it now.
Vladimir Putin: True, we did not have it before, but now we do indeed have it. We can be proud of this. This is fantastic. I know that only a few of those who worked on the motorway all these years are here today. But, as they say, represented by you, I would like to congratulate all those who had a hand in this and who gave their heart, as well as their skills to this project.
It is quite clear, and you are all aware that this motorway will promote the development of the regions across which it runs. It will boost their economic development and increase accessibility, because when vehicles drive faster they do not harm the environment so much, and so on. There are many positive factors. However, there are also alternate routes, for example, the M10 motorway. This is wonderful. Thank you. I congratulate all of you and I wish you all the best.
Chairman of the Board of the State Company Russian Highways Vyacheslav Petushenko: Mr President, allow me to open the motorway.
Vladimir Putin: Of course, go ahead.
Remark: You have also given the motorway a name.
Vladimir Putin: I did not choose it, the people did. As you know, there were three options: Valdai, Neva and Dve Stolitsy [Two Capitals]. Neva gained the most votes. And this is what we will name the road.
Vyacheslav Petushenko: I hereby open the Neva road.
(The motorway is opened to traffic)
These cars drove together with us from Moscow to St Petersburg yesterday. It took us slightly more than six hours, because we made several stops. Other vehicles took the alternative route, and it took them longer.
Vladimir Putin: I have driven between Moscow and St Petersburg several times. It takes approximately ten hours.
Remark: It took six hours yesterday.
Vyacheslav Petushenko: Without any effort.
Minister of Transport Yevgeny Ditrikh: And without breaking any rules.
Vladimir Putin: It took me ten hours by the old route, M10.
Yevgeny Ditrikh: Ten hours at best. Traffic has become much heavier now. We saw masses of lorries along the way. Using the new motorway is not only easy but it is driver-friendly too.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you, and all the best!
