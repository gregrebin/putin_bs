President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Čeferin, I am very happy to see you again.
It is not a coincidence that you are in St Petersburg. We are well aware that St Petersburg is among the12 European cities chosen to host UEFA Cup matches next year. And this will be a special tournament since it will coincide with the 60th anniversary of the championships, European football championships. It carries a lot of meaning for us because when the first championship was held 60 years ago, the winner was the national team of the Soviet Union.
Russia has been a UEFA member since its founding in 1954, if I am not mistaken. And our representatives are involved in most of its committees and commissions.
Mr President, while in Nizhny Novgorod, you praised Russia’s abilities to prepare and hold large-scale international competitions. We will do our best not to let you down, not to disappoint the fans and players.
President of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Alexander Čeferin: Thank you very much for inviting me, Mr President. It is an honour, it is a pleasure, not just because St Petersburg is one of the 12 cities, but also because there is a very important match of Zenit St Petersburg here tonight. We will go to see the Champions’ League match.
We are at UEFA very happy that Russia is more and more a football country. And I must say that the World Cup was organised perfectly. I am not much of a diplomat, and those two guys know that I do not just speak to be nice, but I really mean it. It was organised perfectly, and I am sure you are capable of organising top events in the future.
Thank you very much again, especially because I know that your schedule is unbelievable, for taking some time to meet tonight.
Vladimir Putin: You are correct in pointing out that football’s popularity is growing in our country. It has been and remains the most popular sport. But its popularity is growing indeed. Today, according to our estimates, about 3 million of our people are connected with football one way or another. And the surge in popularity is linked, among other things, with hosting such large events as the FIFA World Cup, for example.

Meeting with World Economic Forum Executive Chairman Klaus Martin Schwab
During his visit to St Petersburg, Vladimir Putin met with Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Martin Schwab.

The meeting was attended by Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Schwab, please accept my sincere greetings. I am happy to see you again.
We all know the current state of the world economy. There are many problems and the number of unpredictable variables is continually on the rise.
Global GDP rates are dropping. According to the WTO, trade will probably grow by about 1.2 percent instead of the predicted 4 percent.
This is why your international venue, the Global Economic Forum, is in such demand and is of great use. It supports people striving to work openly and in line with current international law and promotes contacts between business and government officials.
This is why we have always supported and will continue to support our relations with the forum you founded. Naturally, Russian representatives have always attended and will attend your events.
In turn, we conduct similar events that are primarily aimed at establishing business contacts with Russia’s partners. You know we have the Economic Forum here in St Petersburg as well as different events in the Far East, Siberia and southern Russia. So we are following your example. I hope that we are not letting you down and that we are working in unison.
Executive Chairmanof the World Economic Forum (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for the warm reception. We are indeed linked by many years of good cooperation. It always mattered to me that Russian representatives took part in our events in Davos. It has always had a special meaning for me.
Much has changed since you last attended our forum. We are progressing, and now we have the status of an international organisation in Switzerland. Our goal, as you have already said, is to help enhance cooperation between businesspeople and state structures.
We are confident that the significant challenges we face, be it the climate and environment issues or economic growth problems, can only be resolved through cooperation, and at the global level.
I would also like to express my positive emotions after I spent two days in Moscow. Some people call me the father of the fourth industrial revolution. I wrote a book about it and would like to give it to you.
I also heard, including from Minister Oreshkin, that Russia has managed to make significant advancements, especially in striving to develop artificial intelligence. We are asking ourselves how to cope with these challenges including via global cooperation. We think that specific problems will arise in building global cooperation in the area of new technologies. We will need new global standards, new ethical norms, including in AI technology development. This is the reason why we set up a network of centres where we analyse technologies of the fourth industrial revolution.

Meeting on effect of M11 Moscow-St Petersburg motorway on socioeconomic development in regions
Following the opening ceremony of the M11 Moscow-St Petersburg motorway, the President chaired a meeting on the effect this investment project will have on the socioeconomic development in the regions.

St Petersburg
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
We are attending a pleasant and memorable event. This large infrastructure project has been completed and will have a major effect on the north western regions and the country as a whole. It will enhance the competitiveness of the regions across which the motorway runs, create new tourism opportunities and increase these regions’ investment appeal.
When I saw our French colleague [Yves-Thibault de Silguy, Deputy Chairman of the Board of the Vinci Group] here, I recalled that he took part in the signing of a memorandum in Paris in 2006, which President Chirac and I attended. It is gratifying that we not only plan but also implement such large-scale projects. This means that we achieve good results when we stay focused and work hard.
I would like to point out that this project is a positive example of public-private partnership. It has been implemented through a combination of state and private efforts and with a contribution from French and Turkish construction firms. All of them worked as a close-knit team focused on results. And we have achieved this.
I would like to ask the heads of the regions across which the motorway runs to express their opinions and say a few words about their plans. I want you to know, however, that your job is far from over, and that possibly it has just started, and here is why. The motorway should be made more driver-friendly, which is largely, no, not largely but entirely the job of the regions. The construction workers have done their job – they have built the motorway and now it should be made more driver-friendly, which is the direct responsibility of the regional authorities. The motorway must have service areas, petrol stations, restaurants and cafes, communications, the internet, and many other things. And everything must be up-to-date, just as the motorway itself.
It is clear that we have not had anything like this in the history of Russian road construction before. But, as the construction workers said, we have it now. We will proceed from the notion that this is a first and a positive experience. There are plans for constructing such motorways in other directions as well, for example towards Vladimir and further still. I believe that the minister, who will be reporting now, will tell us about this.
I would like to congratulate all of you once again on this achievement. First of all, we should thank our partners, those who did an excellent job and who completed the project. I am referring to the workers and engineers, all who had a hand in this and gave their heart, as well as their skill and professionalism to this project.
Congratulations to all of you!
<…>
Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you for your efforts and their results. I ask the Ministry and the regions’ heads to nominate people for government awards for the results of this work.
Thank you very much.
We will continue implementing our plans, taking into account, among other things, the suggestions put forth during our meeting.
Thank you.
