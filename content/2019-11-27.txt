President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Čeferin, I am very happy to see you again.
It is not a coincidence that you are in St Petersburg. We are well aware that St Petersburg is among the12 European cities chosen to host UEFA Cup matches next year. And this will be a special tournament since it will coincide with the 60th anniversary of the championships, European football championships. It carries a lot of meaning for us because when the first championship was held 60 years ago, the winner was the national team of the Soviet Union.
Russia has been a UEFA member since its founding in 1954, if I am not mistaken. And our representatives are involved in most of its committees and commissions.
Mr President, while in Nizhny Novgorod, you praised Russia’s abilities to prepare and hold large-scale international competitions. We will do our best not to let you down, not to disappoint the fans and players.
President of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Alexander Čeferin: Thank you very much for inviting me, Mr President. It is an honour, it is a pleasure, not just because St Petersburg is one of the 12 cities, but also because there is a very important match of Zenit St Petersburg here tonight. We will go to see the Champions’ League match.
We are at UEFA very happy that Russia is more and more a football country. And I must say that the World Cup was organised perfectly. I am not much of a diplomat, and those two guys know that I do not just speak to be nice, but I really mean it. It was organised perfectly, and I am sure you are capable of organising top events in the future.
Thank you very much again, especially because I know that your schedule is unbelievable, for taking some time to meet tonight.
Vladimir Putin: You are correct in pointing out that football’s popularity is growing in our country. It has been and remains the most popular sport. But its popularity is growing indeed. Today, according to our estimates, about 3 million of our people are connected with football one way or another. And the surge in popularity is linked, among other things, with hosting such large events as the FIFA World Cup, for example.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Schwab, please accept my sincere greetings. I am happy to see you again.
We all know the current state of the world economy. There are many problems and the number of unpredictable variables is continually on the rise.
Global GDP rates are dropping. According to the WTO, trade will probably grow by about 1.2 percent instead of the predicted 4 percent.
This is why your international venue, the Global Economic Forum, is in such demand and is of great use. It supports people striving to work openly and in line with current international law and promotes contacts between business and government officials.
This is why we have always supported and will continue to support our relations with the forum you founded. Naturally, Russian representatives have always attended and will attend your events.
In turn, we conduct similar events that are primarily aimed at establishing business contacts with Russia’s partners. You know we have the Economic Forum here in St Petersburg as well as different events in the Far East, Siberia and southern Russia. So we are following your example. I hope that we are not letting you down and that we are working in unison.
Executive Chairmanof the World Economic Forum (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for the warm reception. We are indeed linked by many years of good cooperation. It always mattered to me that Russian representatives took part in our events in Davos. It has always had a special meaning for me.
Much has changed since you last attended our forum. We are progressing, and now we have the status of an international organisation in Switzerland. Our goal, as you have already said, is to help enhance cooperation between businesspeople and state structures.
We are confident that the significant challenges we face, be it the climate and environment issues or economic growth problems, can only be resolved through cooperation, and at the global level.
I would also like to express my positive emotions after I spent two days in Moscow. Some people call me the father of the fourth industrial revolution. I wrote a book about it and would like to give it to you.
I also heard, including from Minister Oreshkin, that Russia has managed to make significant advancements, especially in striving to develop artificial intelligence. We are asking ourselves how to cope with these challenges including via global cooperation. We think that specific problems will arise in building global cooperation in the area of new technologies. We will need new global standards, new ethical norms, including in AI technology development. This is the reason why we set up a network of centres where we analyse technologies of the fourth industrial revolution.
