We have mentioned the Constantine Palace. It lay in ruins. It was crumbling. Only the walls had remained, even the roof had collapsed. And how did the idea arise? I must say honestly that I cannot claim the credit for it. It was about two years ago. I remember the time exactly because it is connected with the premiere of War and Peace at the Mariinsky Theatre. I was in St Petersburg and I was awaiting the British Prime Minister and his wife at the entrance to the theatre. I was approached by a man, who struck me as being rather young and who began talking to me about the problem of the Constantine Palace. He produced some kind of papers, historical evidence and photographs of the dilapidated building and argued that it was necessary to prevent its final demise, to revive it, etc. Frankly, when I went back to Moscow I put all this aside not knowing what to do about it because the cost was too high. The budget does not have that much money. And even if it had, it was hard to justify spending budget money on this because there are far more important problems needing solutions in the social sphere. Later, when it was decided to stage events in the city to mark the 300th anniversary and to hold a Russia-EU summit there, it was suggested that the palace could be restored to become a venue for major international events. We went to our big private companies which gave 99.9% of the money needed for the restoration, a total of $290–300 million. I repeat, everything has been financed by private Russian companies. The budget earmarked 5–10 million roubles and then only to enable the Government to monitor the progress of the work: how the contractor spends the money and so on. That is how the idea was put into practice and, by the way, I have never since seen the man who initiated it. I don’t know his name or his address. So, if he hears this, let him come forward and contact Valentina Matviyenko. They will have things to discuss…
A.Manilova, St Petersburg League of Journalists: People are wondering whether the Constantine Palace is a residence of the Russian President.
Vladimir Putin: By the way, there is not a single residence of the Russian President in St Petersburg. The Constantine Palace is not a residence.
It is a place where major international events are held and I think that Russia needs such a place. I think it would be a good idea to have such a venue in St Petersburg, especially since the complex is outside the historical centre and is unlikely to be much of a hindrance to people as they go about their daily business.
A. Gubankov, Russia-St Petersburg Broadcasting Company: We have mentioned the Constantine Palace and this will be the venue of the summit. In general, a lot of important people will come to St Petersburg, which has prompted a lot of talk among city residents who say that it will not be a democratic holiday, but that it will be mainly a holiday for guests. Can you comment on that?
Vladimir Putin: As far as I know the holiday will start on May 23. And the important people you are talking about will not have arrived yet. They arrive as guests of the city and the country for a day or a day and a half, and some will spend just a few hours. They will be in town in the evening of May 30 and on May 31. They will all have left by evening of May 31 or June 1. I have already mentioned that the festivities might have been treated as a local event, but then the funding I mentioned earlier could hardly have been obtained. I must say that the fact that the 300th anniversary is treated not only as an all-Russian, but at least as a European event has convinced the State Duma deputies and the heads of various ministries and agencies that the city needs money and resources to maintain its appearance, its infrastructure and so on. But that is not the main thing. The main thing is that it is truly a city of an all-Russian and all-European level, so I hope that the presence of VIPs for a day and a half and the celebrations of the 300th anniversary by the local people and those whom we are inviting for the occasion will not clash. At least I hope that they won’t clash.
A. Gubankov, Russia-St Petersburg Broadcasting Company: A follow-up to the topic raised here. Many people in St Petersburg have expressed this kind of fear: the celebrations will be over, they say, the President will go away, the festive banners will be removed from Nevsky Prospekt and that will mark the end of the large-scale work to revive St Petersburg. Can you dispel these doubts and fears?
Vladimir Putin: I think that the city has recently been somewhat neglected. It has been underfunded, in my opinion. I repeat, the 300th anniversary provides an occasion to remind the whole country and Europe of the importance of St Petersburg. Your colleague has just mentioned VIPs. Actually, it was not from us that the idea of having them here originated. Two years ago, in March 2001, I was invited to attend an EU summit in Stockholm, and during a meeting the Prime Minister of Luxembourg stood up and said he had a suggestion to make. “We all take a positive view of what is happening in Russia. In two years’ time St Petersburg, which has been regarded as Russia’s “window to Europe” since the times of Peter the Great, will mark its 300th anniversary. Let us all come to St Petersburg and display Europe’s flags as a token of solidarity and support for Russia.” Naturally, I welcomed the idea. I said that of course we would do everything to organise the event properly. In general, it was a scheduled event. The Russia-EU summit takes place every six months alternating between Moscow and some European capital, but because the event coincided with the 300th anniversary we have invited more of our colleagues than usual.
As for not leaving what has been started, I think that is one of the main challenges for the future. This is my view. Honestly, I have regarded the 300th anniversary exclusively as an occasion to draw the country’s attention to the problems of the city which belongs to all of Russia and all of Europe. As I have said, I am thinking mainly of the city’s cultural heritage. Therefore the city authorities, the city legislature and administration will bear much of the burden of these problems, but the major infrastructure projects that have been initiated and that cannot be completed without federal assistance, will be continued. A start has been made; the arrow has been shot and it cannot be stopped. In any case I very much hope that and I will do all that is necessary to keep things going. We will see these projects through: we will complete the metro, the Ring Road and the dam. And the other facilities too.
I.Pavlovsky, Rosbalt News Agency: Let us look at the European conference that will take place during the celebrations of the 300th anniversary of St Petersburg. An opinion poll conducted in 12 European countries in late April has produced some interesting figures. One in every three respondents has heard about the jubilee of St Petersburg and half of them believe that it is a European and not a local Russian occasion. That shows the reservoir of good will that Europeans have for St Petersburg. Do you think St Petersburg can capitalise on that for its further development? And if so, in what way?
