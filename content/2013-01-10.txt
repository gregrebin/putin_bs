Today the missile cruiser Pyotr Veliky is awarded the Order of Nakhimov. This military decoration was introduced during the Great Patriotic War as a tribute to the glory, courage and feats of the sailors who made a great contribution to the victory over the enemy.
Today, the Order of Nakhimov has regained the prestigious status of a state decoration. I see it as yet another symbol of the revival and development of the Army and Navy’s historical martial traditions.
Pyotr Veliky is a ship that is without equal in the world. Both the cruiser and its crew rightly deserve this decoration. The cruiser has repeatedly excelled in long sea missions, performed combat duty and flew the Russian flag in key strategic areas of the world’s oceans. The crew has successfully carried out its missions and showed impeccable professionalism, skills and bravery.
Courage, valour and honour were always characteristic of our sailors. So it was under Peter the Great, when the Russian fleet was born, and in the days of Admiral Nakhimov, the legendary naval commander and hero of the Sevastopol defence, as well as during World War I and the Great Patriotic War.
Today the Navy sailors here in the Northern Fleet and other fleets perform their duty with honour and make a major contribution to enhancing security and improving the defence capability of our homeland.
”The development of strong and effective Navy is one of Russia’s key priorities. We will consistently develop underwater and surface vessels, strengthen conventional forces and naval strategic nuclear forces.“
I want to emphasise again that the development of strong and effective Navy is one of Russia’s key priorities. We will consistently develop underwater and surface vessels, strengthen conventional forces and naval strategic nuclear forces. In coming years, the fleet will receive over one hundred new surface ships and submarines of different classes. We are fully committed to implementing this ambitious programme.
At present the Russian shipyards are developing and building new ships; design centres are creating new marine technology. A new nuclear-powered missile submarine Yury Dolgoruky will be commissioned into the Navy today. We are planning to build up the rate of the fleet’s renewal and growth.
Comrades,
I am sure you will continue to serve the fleet, your country and the people of Russia.
I thank the crew of the Pyotr Veliky cruiser for conscientiously performing their military duty. I wish you good health and success in the service to Russia.
I congratulate the Pyotr Veliky cruiser on receiving the Order of Nakhimov.

Inspecting a multipurpose vessel of the Vitus Bering series.
Modern multipurpose vessels of the Vitus Bering series will conduct year-round deliveries of personnel, goods and expendable supplies to oil production platforms. In particular, it is planned to use this type of icebreakers to ensure the smooth operation of Sakhalin-1oil platforms at the Arkutun-Dagi field in the Sea of Okhotsk.
The lead ship of the series was named after Vitus Bering, an explorer and officer in the Russian Navy.
The President witnessed the signing of a master cooperation agreement between Sovkomflot and United Shipbuilding Corporation to build supply vessels of this class and an agreement between Gazprom and Novatek to create a joint venture to produce LNG on the Yamal Peninsula.

Speech at the naming ceremony for Vitus Bering icebreaker
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
It gives me great pleasure to be present at the naming ceremony for the Vitus Bering icebreaker, a new vessel in the Russian merchant fleet.
It is noteworthy that the vessel will operate in the Far East, where Vitus Bering and his crew explored the northern latitudes and the vast expanses of the Pacific Ocean as they carried out the plans of Peter the Great.
This is one of the most advanced ships in the world. Today Russia has the world’s largest nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet and we will continue our efforts to develop the full range of special vessels, including those working in such harsh conditions as the ones this ship will operate in.
I want to reiterate that this is one of the most advanced ships in the world, capable of operating in the ice up to 1.7 metres thick. It was built by Russian shipbuilders jointly with Finnish partners, and I want to express my gratitude to our Finnish colleagues.
It is significant that 90% of the work was done by Russian companies. We must continue with the same momentum in the future. I repeat, we have every chance to successfully develop the entire range of special, highly advanced vessels.
I sincerely wish the crew every success and congratulate you on this momentous event.
All the best. Thank you for your attention.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
I want to congratulate everyone who has gathered here aboard the ship [Pyotr Veliky] and the Yury Dolgoruky on a momentous event. Today the Russian naval ensign was hoisted on the nuclear submarine Yury Dolgoruky. The new missile carrier has passed all tests and has been commissioned into the Navy.
I thank all those who took part in designing, building and testing this formidable ship and express our sincere gratitude to the teams of St Petersburg Rubin and Sevmash, who did most of the work.
Yury Dolgoruky is a nuclear submarine of the new generation. Vessels of this class will become a critical element of the naval component of Russia’s strategic forces, a guarantee of global balance and the security of Russia and its allies.

It is symbolic that all these ships will bear the names of our great ancestors, the defenders and unifiers of Russian lands.
In 2013, the fleet will receive a new Borey class submarine Alexander Nevsky. Vladimir Monomakh has already left the building berths.
Last year, construction began on another strategic Borey class cruiser, Prince Vladimir. It is a warship with greater combat capabilities.
Construction of the fifth and sixth Borey class submarines is also planned for 2013. By 2020, eight such nuclear submarines will be built and commissioned into the Navy.
The modernisation of the fleet is one of our top priorities as part of strengthening the Armed Forces. Over 4 trillion rubles [$130 billion] have been allocated for the State Armament Programme to 2020 for the creation of modern, balanced surface ships and submarines.
By 2020, eight Yasen class multipurpose nuclear-powered submarines will be commissioned into the Navy in addition to eight Borey class strategic submarines, as well as multipurpose diesel submarines.
Sevmash will be the key company executing the orders. This legendary shipyard has already built over 120 nuclear-powered submarines for the Russian Navy.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who took part in the creation of the Yury Dolgoruky submarine for their hard work.
”Nuclear submarines will become a critical element of the naval component of Russia’s strategic forces, a guarantee of global balance and the security of Russia and its allies.“
I wish the submarine’s crew every success in their service for the benefit of Russia. I wish you to remain faithful to the glorious traditions of the Navy and Russian submariners.
Mr Shoigu, please.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu
: Comrade Commander-in-Chief,
In accordance with the shipbuilding programme, the Project 955 nuclear-powered submarine Yury Dolgoruky has completed the state tests, which have confirmed all the performance characteristics. The acceptance report has been approved. The St Andrew ensign was raised on the cruiser on January 10, 2013 at 14:10. The ship has been commissioned into to the Navy of the Russian Federation. The ship’s deployment has begun.
This was the report by the Defence Minister, Army General Shoigu.
Vladimir Putin: (addressing Navy Commander Viktor Chirkov) Please report to the Defence Minister on the future deployment of Yury Dolgoruky and report to me on the timeframe in which the rest of the submarines will be commissioned, where they will be deployed, and when the cruisers that are currently in service will be decommissioned – the entire programme.
Navy Commander Viktor Chirkov: Comrade Commander-in-Chief, Comrade Defence Minister,
The nuclear-powered submarine Yury Dolgoruky will begin performing L1 tasks followed by L2 tasks. We have allotted 60 days each for the L1 and L2 tasks. After that, the nuclear-powered submarine Yury Dolgoruky will conduct deep-sea testing at a depth of 600 metres and torpedo firing from a great depth. That will be followed by personnel training using L3 tasks with the use of weapons and Yury Dolgoruky will join the constant combat readiness forces. We expect that by the end of the year two Yury Dolgoruky crews will be fully trained. In January 2014, the submarine will become operational.
The next cruiser is part of the procurement order No 202. We have already begun the tests and by the end of the year we plan to finish testing the second nuclear submarine, which will be commissioned into the Navy next year.
We are implementing the shipbuilding programme as approved by the Executive Order of the President of the Russian Federation, and we plan to commission eight Project 955 submarines into the Navy by the end of 2020.
Vladimir Putin: What is your opinion of the weapons?
Viktor Chirkov: The weapons include 16 ballistic missiles capable of striking targets at long range in accordance with design specifications.
We also devoted a great deal of attention to torpedo armaments and the cruiser’s ability to use long-range cruise missiles. Thus, the characteristics stipulated by the design bureau have been fulfilled. We will do all we can to commission all the submarines by the deadlines.
Vladimir Putin: Good. I congratulate you and all the sailors on this event. This is a great event for the Navy. It confirms our commitment to modernise the Army and Navy. This is a great event in the life of the country. This submarine Yury Dolgoruky is a serious, powerful weapon that will guarantee the security of our country and enhances our defence capability. I wish you success.
Viktor Chirkov: Thank you very much.
