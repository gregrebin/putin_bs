Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong:Thank you for receiving me. We just spent three days in Moscow and we had a very good visit.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: It is a great pleasure to see you, Mr Prime Minister. I would like to thank you for your visit.
Let me start by saying that the relations between our countries are developing. We are very pleased to see this and will do all we can to continue developing these ties.
I would like to note that our mutual investment is increasing in volume. Russian investment in your economy now comes to $2.5 billion, while Singapore has invested up to $1 billion in Russia.
Of course, the establishment of a free trade zone between the Eurasian Economic Union and Singapore would give a boost to trade growth.
Vietnam was the first ASEAN country with which we signed an agreement of this kind. Many of our partners have shown interest in cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union. We would be happy to examine such a possibility with Singapore as well.
We are very happy to see you. Once again, welcome.
Lee Hsien Loong: Thank you for receiving me. As you say, our relations are in good shape, our trade is growing, and we are expanding our cooperation in many other areas as well. Over the last few years, over the past ten years, our trade volume has almost quadrupled, which is not a bad performance. But the absolute level can still be improved much further. It’s not commensurate with the importance of Russia in the world community or with our bilateral relations, which is why we believe that a free trade agreement between Singapore and the Eurasian Union would be able to contribute to this objective.
The first step would be to have a feasibility study to find out if there would be value in this, and we hope that Russia would support us in initiating such a study in order to take the process another step forward.
Already, as you pointed out, we have investments in both directions, Russian companies in Singapore, and quite a few Singaporean companies have invested in Russia. In Singapore, you’ve got of course the oil companies like Lukoil and Gazprom, but also a very interesting range of other companies, including IT companies like Acronis, which has set up a research centre in Singapore and sports goods companies like Sportmaster, which has made Singapore its regional headquarters.
 Into Russia, we have a range of companies, some in agriculture and commodities, others in food and beverages, and there are also companies which are in real estate and hotel development. So we can develop the relationship further and with an FTA I think we can not only increase the volume of exchanges but also diversify the relationship in many new areas.
We also have cultural cooperation. We’ve got a cultural troupe, which is here to perform at the culture ministers’ meeting, and I am told that they performed today and were well received. And we are looking forward to the construction of a Russian cultural centre in Singapore.
We also have cooperation in research and development. Our universities have signed an MOU with the Russian Academy of Sciences and we see many areas where we can work together.
Also, specifically in Moscow, because the mayor has got many ambitious plans for the development of Moscow, we believe that our companies may be able to help him and participate in this so that he can achieve his objectives, whether it’s in transportation or in urban planning or the master plan.
 On a regional basis, we are very happy that Russia is engaging ASEAN and participating in many of ASEAN’s fora like the ASEAN regional forum and the ASEAN defence ministers’ meeting, and we also support Russia’s idea of studying the possibility of an ASEAN-Eurasian Union FTA.
So this 20th anniversary commemorative summit comes at a good time and I look forward to its success and its taking our relationship further forward.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, I can see just how well you know the whole fabric of our bilateral relations. This is the best guarantee that everything we plan will be carried out.
I would like to thank you for your support for all of our plans and undertakings.

With President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar Htin Kyaw.
Mr Putin noted the considerable potential for cooperation in trade and the economy and in the political and military-technical areas.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, allow me to welcome you in Russia.
I have this excellent opportunity to congratulate you personally on your election. I am very happy at the first visit by the President of Myanmar to Russia.
Frankly speaking, our trade and economic relations have not reached a high level yet, but I think that there is good potential for developing them. This is true of the economic side of things, and also of political and military-technical cooperation.
We have already made the first steps. Some of our companies are showing increasing interest in your market. I think that we should encourage the business community to work together in all areas of mutual interest.
We are very happy to see you and your delegation here, Mr President.
President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar Htin Kyaw: Thank you, Your Excellency, for welcoming me and also for giving me the opportunity to see you on the sidelines of this Russia-ASEAN meeting. It gives me great pleasure, and I greatly appreciate you giving your time when you are very busy but you are giving your time to meet me and my delegation. Thank you very much.
I also want to thank you for the fact that since our arrival, the provisions made for us have been very caring. There is nothing that we need and we have received very good care and hospitality at the place where we are staying, starting from the time we set foot in the Russian Federation.
I am very glad to be here, especially since I have been in office for less than two months and I have the chance to visit your country and this beautiful Sochi seaside resort. Last night I couldn’t see what it was like because we got here late, but this morning there’s the sun and people walking along the beach and it’s a very, very pleasant place.
I am pleased to learn that Russian business and enterprises are interested in our economy and in working in our country based on mutual beneficial cooperation, and we would really like to welcome Russian investments in Myanmar. Especially because we have a longstanding friendly relationship since our independence in 1948. Since that time, we have never had any issue or problem with the Russian Federation.

With Prime Minister of Lao People's Democratic Republic Thongloun Sisoulith.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends,
Allow me once again, this time in a more formal setting, to welcome you in Sochi.
Mr Prime Minister, we know you as a reliable friend of this country. Moreover, you and I studied in my hometown, then Leningrad, now St Petersburg, at almost the same time. We may have seen each other on the street back then.
We marked the 55th anniversary of the establishment of relations between our countries, and I strongly hope that under your leadership, we will build on everything that has been done in the past, and will, of course, focus on the future of our relations.
I would like to thank you for supporting the idea to hold the ASEAN-Russia Summit on the 20th anniversary of our relations here in Russia.
I am pleased to be able to discuss our bilateral relations with you.
Prime Minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic Thongloun Sisoulith (retranslated):
Mr Putin,
Thank you for taking the time to meet with the Lao delegation.
I am pleased that after being appointed Prime Minister of the Lao PDR, I am now the co-chair of the summit taking place here.
Tomorrow marks exactly one month since I was appointed to the post of Prime Minister of the Lao PDR. Our meeting coincides with this date.
First, I would like to thank you for your efforts to ensure that the summit does take place in Sochi. As the country holding ASEAN chairmanship in 2016 and coordinating the ASEAN-Russia Dialogue Partnership, we will do our best to make sure that Russia-ASEAN relations grow and expand.
For many years now, Russia and Laos have been partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and we will do our best to promote our bilateral relations.
I would like to thank Russia for its invaluable assistance to our country in the process of nation building.
Our trade and economic relations, as well as investments, are developing steadily. Quite a few Russian companies have invested in Laos.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, allow me to welcome you here. It is a great pleasure to see you again.
Our two countries have developed good relations. We see your country as our reliable partner in the Asia-Pacific region.
I am very pleased to have this chance to meet with you again on the sidelines of this Russia-ASEAN summit. There are some matters particularly topical right now for our cooperation and we will have the chance to discuss them today.
Welcome, Your Majesty!
Sultan of Brunei-Darussalam Hassanal Bolkiah (retranslated): Let me thank you for the warm reception and hospitality. It is a great pleasure to be in Russia once more. I have fond memories of my visit and my participation in the G20 summit in St Petersburg.
I am very pleased with the solid bilateral contacts we have built up and I hope that we will be able to develop them further, including in the energy sector, trade, and defence.
I am very pleased that we will sign two important agreements during this visit: a memorandum of understanding in the defence sector, and an agreement in the culture sector. It is also important to ensure the implementation of our agreement on simplifying visa rules, for this will give a boost to tourism between our two countries.

Meeting with Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, it is a great pleasure to see you again.
Next year, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. It is a pleasure to see the positive development in our relations, and all the more pleasing to say that we see this development in practically all areas.
As I looked through various reference materials, I saw that 15 percent of all doctors in your country received their training at Russian universities. We are very happy to continue developing our humanitarian ties, as well as our economic and investment ties, and of course, our military-technical cooperation and relations in the military sector too.
We are very pleased to see you. Welcome, Mr Prime Minister.
Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak: Thank you very much Mr President. I am equally delighted to meet with you. I do thank you for all of the arrangements you have made, and particularly for the opportunity for us to be here in this beautiful resort of Sochi. I’d like to compliment you for creating this beautiful resort and I’m sure it will be one of the resorts that will be admired around the world.
 I am also delighted that we can have this bilateral meeting on the sidelines of this jubilee summit between ASEAN and the Russian Federation. I think we have come to the stage where we can move our bilateral and multilateral ties to a stronger footing so that we can take advantage of the opportunities both in ASEAN as well as with respect to the developments in Russia.
On the economic front, we are quite pleased with the level of trade between our two countries, although in the first two months of this year the figures had a slight drop, understandably given the global economic situation. But we believe that if we can explore with a means to increase – significantly increase – our level of bilateral trade, this will certainly strengthen our bilateral ties.
 In this respect, I’d like to suggest that we look into the distinct possibility of embarking on a free trade arrangement between Malaysia and the EAEU in the near future because we see that such an arrangement could lead to a significant increase in our bilateral trade and even investment.
 We would also like to consider greater connectivity between our two countries. Tourism is a sector that can promote our bilateral ties, not only business-to-business, but also people-to-people. Given the security concerns in many other places in the world, Malaysia can provide Russian tourists with a safe haven for their holidays abroad, so we would like to see more charter flights into Malaysia and begin exploring direct flights from Kuala Lumpur to Moscow and other parts of Russia.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, allow me to welcome you in Russia.
Cambodia is Russia’s longstanding reliable partner in the Asian region and you are known here as an old and dependable friend of this country. It is therefore a particularly great pleasure to meet with you and welcome you in Sochi.
I am very pleased to have this chance to discuss our bilateral relations here at the Russia-ASEAN summit, and to consider further coordination of our foreign policy efforts, security work, peace maintenance, fighting terrorism and drug trafficking, and, of course, to discuss the development of our trade and economic ties.
I am very happy to see you.
Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen (retranslated): Your Excellency, Mr President, I would like to thank you for this chance to meet during my working visit and this anniversary Russia-ASEAN summit.
Our King Norodom Sihamoni asked me to pass on his deepest respect to you.
I am very pleased to know that you consider Cambodia an old friend and consider me an old friend you can trust. This is a historic meeting because we are now marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and Russia for the help that your country has provided to Cambodia over these 60 years.
Despite the complicated and changing situation in the world, and the changes that took place both in Russia and in Cambodia, I would like to stress that we maintain our special relationship. If we had not had Russia’s help there would be no Cambodia today.
You helped us to liberate our country from Pol Pot’s regime. Without help from the Soviet Union and Russia, we would not have been able to extricate ourselves from that difficult situation. Russia’s assistance to Cambodia has helped us to live and develop.
Our relations have reached a new level now. Last year, Mr Medvedev visited Cambodia and we signed 11 agreements. Recently, we signed another eight agreements. The Minister of Communications and Mass Media has already visited Cambodia twice. The agreements we have signed cover a broad range of areas, and I think that we should continue to expand our cooperation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon Mr Prime Minister. It is a great pleasure to meet you personally.
Russia and Thailand have had very close ties for 120 years now. Indeed, next year we will celebrate the 120th anniversary of our diplomatic relations.
I know that you met with Russia’s Prime Minister in St Petersburg yesterday and signed a number of important agreements. We will do everything we can to ensure their implementation.
I would like to start our discussion now by noting that despite the current global economic situation, our relations continue to develop well in all areas, including foreign politics, defence, and security.
Mr Prime Minister, we are very pleased to see you here and we thank you for your support for today’s event. I ask you to pass on my best wishes to His Majesty the King of Thailand and the Queen. I have very fond memories of my meeting with them.
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha (retranslated): Mr President, on behalf of our country, Thailand, we would like to thank Your Excellency for the invitation to take part in this summit.
This chance that we have to meet and talk face-to-face could be called a historic event.
This year, we are marking the 119th anniversary of our ties, and next year we will celebrate the 120th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. This is also a historic event and we plan to mark this occasion in St Petersburg and Moscow. Our country is already prepared to organise a number of events.
We want to thank Russia for the support that has helped us to maintain our independence.
Yesterday, we thanked the members of the St Petersburg municipal government and His Excellency Mr Medvedev for giving our delegation such a warm welcome.
We will develop and promote our relations, all the more so as we have planned a number of events during the 120th anniversary celebrations next year to further develop and strengthen our relations.
Our talks with His Excellency Mr Medvedev were very constructive and useful.
I have eight ministers with me on this visit. This is the biggest delegation yet on my foreign visits. I also sent two deputy prime ministers in advance of my trip to prepare for this visit in order to make it a success.
We signed 14 agreements yesterday: 9 state agreements and 5 private ones. We will implement these agreements and achieve concrete results.
Yesterday, my ministers had the chance to meet personally with their counterparts here. We discussed ways to increase our trade turnover five-fold over the next five years. I think that we can achieve even greater results over this time.
We also discussed cooperation in the agricultural sector. We would like to sell more agricultural products to Russia. We also spoke of the possibility of sending a Russian delegation to Thailand to see our goods and products.

Earlier in the day, Mr Putin held a number of bilateral meetings with the heads of the delegations to the summit.
Speech at reception
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a genuine pleasure to welcome the heads of delegations and all guests from the ASEAN countries to Russia, to Sochi, a city renowned for its warmth and hospitality, and a city that has also now become a symbol of the Olympic movement, the essence of which is to bring people together.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the partnership between Russia and ASEAN. Right from the start, our cooperation was built on the principles of mutual advantage and respect for each other’s interests. We also share similar approaches to resolving many of today’s problems.

This is the first time Russia is hosting a meeting in this format. We view this as confirmation of the ASEAN countries’ growing interest in stronger ties with our country.
We have prepared for this summit the Sochi Declaration, which sets out our main task – to take the partnership between Russia and ASEAN to a new, strategic level. This will enable us to make better use of our potential to develop cooperation in the political, economic, cultural and humanitarian fields, and of course, to work together on regional and international security issues.
It is important that both Russia and the ASEAN countries support stronger integration and links between the big economic projects underway in the Asia-Pacific region. Tomorrow, we will discuss the prospects for developing a broad trans-boundary partnership between the Eurasian Economic Union, ASEAN, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
I would like to stress that we are prepared for constructive joint work in the interests of our countries and peoples. I have no doubt that we will achieve success.
Tomorrow, we have work to do, but today, let me wish a pleasant evening to all my colleagues and their spouses.
I would like to raise a toast to the heads of delegations and to everyone present, to the prosperity of our peoples and to continued close and productive cooperation between Russia and the ASEAN countries.
Thank you.
