Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong:Thank you for receiving me. We just spent three days in Moscow and we had a very good visit.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: It is a great pleasure to see you, Mr Prime Minister. I would like to thank you for your visit.
Let me start by saying that the relations between our countries are developing. We are very pleased to see this and will do all we can to continue developing these ties.
I would like to note that our mutual investment is increasing in volume. Russian investment in your economy now comes to $2.5 billion, while Singapore has invested up to $1 billion in Russia.
Of course, the establishment of a free trade zone between the Eurasian Economic Union and Singapore would give a boost to trade growth.
Vietnam was the first ASEAN country with which we signed an agreement of this kind. Many of our partners have shown interest in cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union. We would be happy to examine such a possibility with Singapore as well.
We are very happy to see you. Once again, welcome.
Lee Hsien Loong: Thank you for receiving me. As you say, our relations are in good shape, our trade is growing, and we are expanding our cooperation in many other areas as well. Over the last few years, over the past ten years, our trade volume has almost quadrupled, which is not a bad performance. But the absolute level can still be improved much further. It’s not commensurate with the importance of Russia in the world community or with our bilateral relations, which is why we believe that a free trade agreement between Singapore and the Eurasian Union would be able to contribute to this objective.
The first step would be to have a feasibility study to find out if there would be value in this, and we hope that Russia would support us in initiating such a study in order to take the process another step forward.
Already, as you pointed out, we have investments in both directions, Russian companies in Singapore, and quite a few Singaporean companies have invested in Russia. In Singapore, you’ve got of course the oil companies like Lukoil and Gazprom, but also a very interesting range of other companies, including IT companies like Acronis, which has set up a research centre in Singapore and sports goods companies like Sportmaster, which has made Singapore its regional headquarters.
 Into Russia, we have a range of companies, some in agriculture and commodities, others in food and beverages, and there are also companies which are in real estate and hotel development. So we can develop the relationship further and with an FTA I think we can not only increase the volume of exchanges but also diversify the relationship in many new areas.
We also have cultural cooperation. We’ve got a cultural troupe, which is here to perform at the culture ministers’ meeting, and I am told that they performed today and were well received. And we are looking forward to the construction of a Russian cultural centre in Singapore.
We also have cooperation in research and development. Our universities have signed an MOU with the Russian Academy of Sciences and we see many areas where we can work together.
Also, specifically in Moscow, because the mayor has got many ambitious plans for the development of Moscow, we believe that our companies may be able to help him and participate in this so that he can achieve his objectives, whether it’s in transportation or in urban planning or the master plan.
 On a regional basis, we are very happy that Russia is engaging ASEAN and participating in many of ASEAN’s fora like the ASEAN regional forum and the ASEAN defence ministers’ meeting, and we also support Russia’s idea of studying the possibility of an ASEAN-Eurasian Union FTA.
So this 20th anniversary commemorative summit comes at a good time and I look forward to its success and its taking our relationship further forward.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, I can see just how well you know the whole fabric of our bilateral relations. This is the best guarantee that everything we plan will be carried out.
I would like to thank you for your support for all of our plans and undertakings.

With President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar Htin Kyaw.
Mr Putin noted the considerable potential for cooperation in trade and the economy and in the political and military-technical areas.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, allow me to welcome you in Russia.
I have this excellent opportunity to congratulate you personally on your election. I am very happy at the first visit by the President of Myanmar to Russia.
Frankly speaking, our trade and economic relations have not reached a high level yet, but I think that there is good potential for developing them. This is true of the economic side of things, and also of political and military-technical cooperation.
We have already made the first steps. Some of our companies are showing increasing interest in your market. I think that we should encourage the business community to work together in all areas of mutual interest.
We are very happy to see you and your delegation here, Mr President.
President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar Htin Kyaw: Thank you, Your Excellency, for welcoming me and also for giving me the opportunity to see you on the sidelines of this Russia-ASEAN meeting. It gives me great pleasure, and I greatly appreciate you giving your time when you are very busy but you are giving your time to meet me and my delegation. Thank you very much.
I also want to thank you for the fact that since our arrival, the provisions made for us have been very caring. There is nothing that we need and we have received very good care and hospitality at the place where we are staying, starting from the time we set foot in the Russian Federation.
I am very glad to be here, especially since I have been in office for less than two months and I have the chance to visit your country and this beautiful Sochi seaside resort. Last night I couldn’t see what it was like because we got here late, but this morning there’s the sun and people walking along the beach and it’s a very, very pleasant place.
I am pleased to learn that Russian business and enterprises are interested in our economy and in working in our country based on mutual beneficial cooperation, and we would really like to welcome Russian investments in Myanmar. Especially because we have a longstanding friendly relationship since our independence in 1948. Since that time, we have never had any issue or problem with the Russian Federation.

With Prime Minister of Lao People's Democratic Republic Thongloun Sisoulith.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends,
Allow me once again, this time in a more formal setting, to welcome you in Sochi.
Mr Prime Minister, we know you as a reliable friend of this country. Moreover, you and I studied in my hometown, then Leningrad, now St Petersburg, at almost the same time. We may have seen each other on the street back then.
We marked the 55th anniversary of the establishment of relations between our countries, and I strongly hope that under your leadership, we will build on everything that has been done in the past, and will, of course, focus on the future of our relations.
I would like to thank you for supporting the idea to hold the ASEAN-Russia Summit on the 20th anniversary of our relations here in Russia.
I am pleased to be able to discuss our bilateral relations with you.
Prime Minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic Thongloun Sisoulith (retranslated):
Mr Putin,
Thank you for taking the time to meet with the Lao delegation.
I am pleased that after being appointed Prime Minister of the Lao PDR, I am now the co-chair of the summit taking place here.
Tomorrow marks exactly one month since I was appointed to the post of Prime Minister of the Lao PDR. Our meeting coincides with this date.
First, I would like to thank you for your efforts to ensure that the summit does take place in Sochi. As the country holding ASEAN chairmanship in 2016 and coordinating the ASEAN-Russia Dialogue Partnership, we will do our best to make sure that Russia-ASEAN relations grow and expand.
For many years now, Russia and Laos have been partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and we will do our best to promote our bilateral relations.
I would like to thank Russia for its invaluable assistance to our country in the process of nation building.
Our trade and economic relations, as well as investments, are developing steadily. Quite a few Russian companies have invested in Laos.
