The President congratulated Foreign Intelligence Service staff and veterans on the 95th anniversary of Russian illegal intelligence.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, colleagues,
I would like to congratulate all current staff and veterans of the Foreign Intelligence Service on the 95th anniversary of Russian illegal intelligence.
For almost a century this legendary unit has been making its own special, sometimes invaluable contribution to ensuring national security and defending the interests of the Fatherland.
Our country has faced many trials, and our intelligence officers have always been on the frontline. Time and again their decisive actions, the information they obtained and their adroit missions literally changed the course of history, protected our people from threats, and preserved peace.
We will always remember our heroic intelligence officers who fought the Nazis. Their struggle against this evil began in the pre-war years, and they fought just as courageously during the Great Patriotic War.
Their work was strenuous and dangerous in the Cold War era as well. It is enough to recall the contribution of our intelligence officers to maintaining strategic parity. Ending the monopoly on nuclear weapons ruled out both a new world war and direct aggression against our country.
The history of illegal intelligence is filled with legendary names: Yakov Serebryansky, Dmitry Bystroletov, Nikolai Kuznetsov, Iosif Grigulevich, Rudolf Abel, Konon Molody, Gevork Vartanyan, Alexei Kozlov and Yury Drozdov, to name a few. There are living people on this glorious list – Goar Vartanyan, Alexei Botyan and many and many others.
In years past dozens of undercover agents have received the high title of Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of the Russian Federation. Hundreds were awarded with combat orders and medals. Today yet another Star of the Hero of Russia will be conferred on one of our comrades at a closed ceremony. He has displayed valour and courage while fulfilling special missions in life-threatening circumstances.
The difficult profession of undercover agent assumes anonymity. It is no accident that the motto of illegal intelligence is: “Without the right to glory but for the glory of the nation.”
Undercover agents are people of a special disposition, moral fortitude and willpower. They devote their entire lives to the homeland. They sacrifice much, forgo much, but they do so in the name of service to the Fatherland. They do intensive, meticulous work every day, without weekends or holidays. They are modest people who do not like being called heroes. They say that they are simply doing their jobs, ”what they were trained to do,” and producing results.
But I would like to emphasise – our country, our citizens must know that real warriors, courageous and honest professionals are serving in Russian intelligence. We are proud of them.
Friends,
I regularly receive materials prepared by your colleagues, including undercover agents. It is always thoroughly prepared information and analysis. It serves as the foundation for developing strategic decisions in defence, foreign policy, and ensuring the country's security in the broadest sense of the word.
Of course, many countries of the world have intelligence services, but not all states have such a powerful and special tool as illegal intelligence. I would like to thank everyone who in difficult years – I am confident you know what I am referring to – have preserved traditions, continuity, experience, and the school of training in the sphere of illegal intelligence. Today, this capacity is fully utilised in service to Russia. It helps identify and block external threats in a timely manner and protect our sovereignty and right to be a free and independent country.
You are well aware of the challenges faced by Russia. They include attempts to hinder our development, to provoke confrontation, and to destabilise the regions near our borders. In particular, terrorist and extremist groups are being used as tools. It is no secret that some of them are being diligently looked after, and even receive direct support from special services of a number of states.
In general, it is clear that the activity of foreign intelligence services directed against Russia and our allies is on the rise. Innovative methods of collecting and falsifying information, cyberattacks, and attempts to recruit agents to gain access to data on the defence, economic, resource potential of Russia are being used. Finally, operations are carried out to influence the political and social processes in our country.
In these circumstances, the Foreign Intelligence Service and all our special services bear an enormous responsibility. Your effective work is one of the most important guarantees of Russia’s sovereign development, security and stability. As such, we will continue to improve and expand our intelligence capacity, and technical and operational capabilities. We will continue to rely on experienced professionals and train young professionals using the best examples from our veterans.
I am confident that you will never fail and will effectively carry out all your missions.
Once again, I congratulate you on the 95th anniversary of illegal intelligence. I congratulate everyone in this room, all our colleagues. And, of course, the agents who are now serving abroad.
I wish you good health, good luck, and new victories for the greater good of Russia.

Meeting with Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
Vladimir Putin met with leader of the Russian Federation Communist Party (KPRF) faction in the State Duma Gennady Zyuganov.

The Kremlin, Moscow

Leader of the Communist Party faction in the State Duma, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Gennady Zyuganov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Zyuganov, we are meeting for one of our regular sessions to discuss your activities. As you know, I recently met with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin
and with [A Just Russia party leader] Sergei Mironov
.
Leader of KPRF State Duma faction Gennady Zyuganov
: So, it’s my turn now.
Vladimir Putin: Let us talk about the issues that you regard as priorities.
Gennady Zyuganov: Okay. But first I would like to congratulate you on the anniversary of Russian illegal intelligence. I saw a very interesting story. I served in a similar unit, only in military intelligence. Let us wish our special services success.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, absolutely.
Gennady Zyuganov: We have just held a congress where a new team was elected, a strong, young and modern team. I am happy to tell you that we have prepared a practical programme to move the country out of the crisis. I wanted to submit it to you; I have this document with me, our draft of the law. I believe that its implementation would greatly increase the budget revenue.
We have drafted a bill we badly need now. It is called Education for All. We had the best brains working on it. You know them: Zhores Alferov, [Ivan] Melnikov, [Oleg] Smolin and [Vladimir] Kashin.
We also have a gift: we have finished building Russia’s best school. Since you have declared the Decade of Childhood, I believe we should join our efforts to implement this programme. Back in the early part of its history, the Soviet government saved 5 million orphans after the end of the Civil War. After the Great Patriotic War, we had 19 million children who had lost both parents or one parent – the father. Back then we created the Suvorov and Nakhimov cadet schools and also vocational schools. We have a very effective programme for supporting children amid the crisis and the sanctions.
Vladimir Putin: What is this school you are talking about?
Gennady Zyuganov: I will present it. It is located nearby, on the Lenin Farm. It is the school of the future. We spent 1.5 billion rubles of our own funds on it. It has a kindergarten and a unique children’s park based on Pushkin’s fairy tales. It’s fantastic! I suggest that you hold a meeting of the State Council or its presidium there.
By the way, the farm is doing very well, producing 10,000 litres of milk per cow and growing strawberries. The average salary at the farm is 77,000 rubles. This is a very interesting experience.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you for the honey.
Gennady Zyuganov: The farm also has the best orchards in the country, with 150 varieties of apples that grow in central Russia and some 50 kinds of fruits. They have pear trees and fruit bushes, and everything there is in an ideal condition. You should see it; it is very interesting.
Our Zvenigovsky Farm in the Republic of Mari El has been declared the best in Europe. We presented 32 types of meat products, anonymously numbered, at the Messe Frankfurt trade fair, and they won 25 gold medals, seven silver medals and the cup. When the Germans saw that these products came from Russia, and worse still, from the Communists, they were shocked.
This farm has paid over 1 billion rubles in taxes alone. It produces about 13–14 billion rubles worth of products. The farm sells them from Udmurtia to the Ulyanovsk Region and owns 500 shops. The products are made to Soviet-era standards and sell out within minutes because the quality is superb.
We have established a similar farm in the Irkutsk Region, and it has also become one of the best. Governor Levchenko
has met with Chinese leaders, and they signed four new programmes, including in tourism.
We have a programme for celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. We are grateful to you for establishing the organising committee for this event. We joined forces with Moscow University Rector Viktor Sadovnichy to hold a large conference about this date at the university. The leaders of all the left-wing patriotic parties, and there are over 150 of them, have asked us to host the celebrations. We have plans for three-day celebrations in St Petersburg, that is, Leningrad: the Tauride Palace, the Hermitage, the Smolny Institute, the cruiser Aurora, and a gala meeting at the Oktyabrsky Concert Hall, which can seat 4,000 people. We also have a similar programme for Moscow: The Hall of Columns, the Kremlin, the Armoury, and the Great Patriotic War Museum on Poklonnaya Gora. We expect some 150 delegations from 100 countries. I have prepared the programme and would like to coordinate it with you. I hope you will approve it. We will host MPs from many countries. The best thing is that nearly all of them support us on the matters of Crimea and Donbass. These people have a positive opinion about us.
Vladimir Putin: When do you plan to hold this event?
Gennady Zyuganov: From November 2 to 9, three days in St Petersburg and three days in Moscow. The gala meetings in the Tauride Palace and in the Hall of Columns. The speakers are ready.
By the way, they are very loyal to us despite the sanctions. We have met with them in Beijing, Hanoi and Strasbourg. We will also have delegates from Europe, despite the sanctions. The left-wing and centre-left parties have a favourable attitude towards this matter. They do not fear the sanctions, and they will be happy to come.
