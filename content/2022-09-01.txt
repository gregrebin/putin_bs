President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
Today, on Knowledge Day, September 1, we are holding the first meeting of the Supervisory Council of the Russian Movement of Children and Youth. You probably already know that I just had a good meeting – here in Kaliningrad – with schoolchildren who are actively involved in such programs as Bolshaya Peremena, in the Young Army, and other volunteer, patriotic, and educational projects. Two participants of that meeting are also here now – Emilia Kotlyar and Artyom Klimkov; we invited them.
The initiative to create the movement we are talking about, as you know, actually came from schoolchildren. It is important that all our decisions continue to be based on children’s opinions, to follow their aspirations and dreams.
Our young people, our children are very talented and very open. They have so much energy, and many ideas to build and create, to form a new modern space for development, in their own interests and in the interests of our great country.
Therefore, the adults’ job is first of all to help and support children, to act as their equal partners, to develop this organisation according to the rules that the participants in the movement themselves propose, and to work together so as to consolidate the best children's and youth projects and make participation accessible to everyone, both younger children and teenagers.

I would like to specifically emphasise that the new movement should not become a privilege for children living in big cities, where it is easier to set up and organise activities. Now, the new movement should be present in every community where children are growing up including small towns, rural areas and even our most remote regions. It is imperative to thoroughly think through this movement’s infrastructure – where the participants can meet, where they can implement their ideas and projects. I would like to address this separately today.
At the same time, I would like to emphasise that voluntary participation should be the underlying principle. By no means should it become an obligation; this is something to be avoided. A child should join the movement because they find it interesting to do stuff there, and not because someone suggested or recommended they join, let alone required them to. This is completely inappropriate.
This new movement should rely on the best educational and awareness-raising programmes, both newly-created and those that have worked effectively for generations. We have such traditions; they are recognised and popular in society.
One such programme involves volunteering to help others, those who need help. I have just discussed this with the children; there are initiatives like this, and children are happy to volunteer for these programmes.
We must create even more opportunities for the younger generation to work together, to meet, to work on projects with their peers from other regions, and to make friends all over the country – from Kaliningrad, where we are now, to Vladivostok, from Kamchatka to Crimea. They should travel together, get to know our country.
Indicatively, we have a special programme called More Than a Journey. It gives young people an opportunity not only to see the country and visit unique places but also to feel like part of a big, friendly family, a team that can meet any challenge.
Of course, in addition to Russian students, it is vital to encourage student participation from the Lugansk and Donetsk people’s republics in this movement.
Another thing I would like to draw your attention to is staffing, that is, attracting people that can become senior friends for children and teenagers, who can lead them into the adult world.
Considering the potential scale of the movement, the broad range of themes and the participation of many children and young people of different ages, we will need to involve professionals and increase the number of people working in this area. The movement should welcome people that are interested in working with children, in their development and upbringing, who understand the importance of this work and realise the responsibility they bear.
I will repeat that these people should be passionate professionals who are capable of leading children and who are more interesting to them than the huge amounts of information in the modern world. We need people who will help them figure out the underlying meaning of these information flows, to dismiss everything false and ostentatious and to skillfully present genuine values, such as family, friendship, love for their homeland, and the values of self-fulfillment and development and meaningful engagement in the life of society and the whole country.
It is difficult to ensure continuity in Russia’s development without this, without care for the fundamental principles of life. It is not enough to simply pass knowledge on to children; it is no less important to teach them how to use it, to explain how to live and work.
I hope to hear your specific considerations and proposals on this issue today. We will determine the next measures and tasks for the future together.

Vladimir Putin: I do not think I need to repeat how important our work is, and how relevant it is today, given the difficulties, the challenges and the dangers posed by the current situation in public morals and education. It is very important for us to avoid this.
At today’s meeting with the children, we spoke about mentoring – someone asked a question. Now some of our colleagues have mentioned it here. A mentor is like a ship’s pilot, someone who helps young adults, young souls to avoid shipwreck in the sea of these challenges and dangers, but follow the right track passing between Scylla and Charybdis. The nationwide movement’s mission will be to ensure this, to find people – as I said at the beginning of our meeting – people who have a vocation and enough enthusiasm, who realise the responsibility on their shoulders, but who will undertake this big – grandiose, I dare say – and hugely important work for the country.
I would like to stress once again that by no means should this process be allowed to get bogged down in red tape; otherwise, our efforts will go down the drain from the very first steps. This is the most important condition for making this entire enterprise a success.
I am sure that everyone present here today understands this. We must do everything in our power to ensure its success.
Much has been said today. Of course, we can talk more, and we need to think about this constantly, and even more than that. But let's assume that for a start, for a run-up, as they say, the first test of this difficult apparatus, and this round should give us a good start to this grand and important endeavor.
I would like to thank everyone for their willingness to work and to wish us all success. Once again, happy Knowledge Day to everyone.
Thank you very much.

Meeting with Governor of Kaliningrad Region Anton Alikhanov

Anton Alikhanov
began his report with the situation in education. In recent years, four schools and 17 kindergartens have been built in the region. This year, 3,500 more children enrolled at the region’s educational institutions than last year. Thanks to a new demographic subsidy from the Government, the growing region was able to conclude concession agreements for the construction of schools, to attract private funds, and 10 more schools will be built in the next five years in the Kaliningrad Region.
The region’s population is growing, but so far this is due to migration. The region is attractive, with the population growing by about 1 percent per year over the past five years. However, additional regional measures need to be adopted to spur natural growth; the regional authorities are working on this now.
The Governor also spoke about the opportunities for extracurricular education for schoolchildren, and vacation options for children. Several corporate children's camps closed in the late 1990s. An agreement has been reached with former owners of those camps to transfer the land plots to the region; the plan is to revive the camps and build infrastructure for year-round operation. The respective proposals will be prepared.

Mr Alikhanov also reported positive results of a feasibility study for the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University campus project. Construction will begin this year. The tercentenary of Immanuel Kant will be marked in 2024, an important anniversary for the Kaliningrad Region as well as for the international scientific community, the Governor added. Anton Alikhanov invited the President to take part in the anniversary events.
Answering the President's question about the creation of the Museum and Theatre Education Complex, Anton Alikhanov said that the Central Music School, which is part of the complex, began its work late last year and has become an internationally recognised institution. So far, 132 children attend it. The campaign to enrol children in the Academy of Choreography is underway, as is the construction of the branches of the Tretyakov Gallery and the Bolshoi Theatre. The region’s culture has reached a new level of development.
Vladimir Putin noted that he has long thought about using the artworks that are currently stored in the repositories of the Hermitage Museum and the Tretyakov Gallery to exhibit them in the Kaliningrad Region, Kemerovo, Vladivostok and Sevastopol. It will facilitate museum studies and provide public access to these masterpieces, as well as improve the training of experts and the quality of life in those regions.
Anton Alikhanov also spoke about major economic projects. Despite restrictions imposed by the neighbouring states, fixed asset investment growth in the first six months of 2022 was over 50 percent as compared to the previous year. The Rosatom state corporation plans to begin the construction of the region’s largest plant to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, electric car batteries and various types of electric vehicles this year.
As for transport issues, in the beginning of the year, two ferries operated between Baltiysk and Ust-Luga; there are currently eight of them. But there are already waiting lists for them; therefore, Anton Alikhanov asked the President to issue relevant instructions to the Transport Ministry: there are available capacities in the Black Sea and other waters; ferries and bulk carriers can be relocated to the Kaliningrad Region to service roll on/roll off operations. It is crucial for the region to bypass restrictions illegitimately imposed by the Lithuanian neighbours. According to the Governor, a draft resolution has already been developed together with the Government to subsidise these operations so that the route and its cost would remain at the same level as it was before the restrictions.
The President emphasised that all the necessary, useful and economically viable measures will be implemented.

Remarks at the opening ceremony in five general education schools with instruction in Russian in Tajikistan
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Greetings, Mr Putin.
Dear education workers and schoolchildren,
I am sincerely happy to attend today’s opening ceremony of new educational institutions together with President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
I remember 2019, when the President of Russia and I launched this project to build five schools with Russian as the language of instruction in the cities of Khujand, Tursunzoda, Kulob, Bokhtar, and in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.
I am happy that we have managed to fully implement it in a relatively short period of time, and now the younger generation has additional opportunities to get an education in new schools that have the latest in education technologies and equipment.

On behalf of the Government of Tajikistan and myself, I would like to thank the Government of the Russian Federation and you personally, Mr President, for your support and comprehensive assistance during the high-quality construction work and for opening the new educational institutions on time.
It is symbolic that they are opening their doors for teachers and schoolchildren this year, during the anniversary of diplomatic ties between our states. Over the last three decades, Tajikistan and Russia have achieved significant results in developing and strengthening our relations of strategic partnership, which encompasses almost all key spheres of cooperation today.
The consistent build-up of humanitarian ties, including in the areas of education, science and culture, has a special place on the bilateral agenda. Further expansion of cultural and humanitarian cooperation is a constant priority for discussion during regular meetings and contacts at the highest level.
Over this period, we have developed the necessary legislative base for education and research cooperation in our relations. More than 200 documents on bilateral cooperation have been signed between governments, relevant departments and universities of the two countries. They serve as a solid foundation for the further development of cooperation in education and science. A good foundation has been laid for comprehensive cooperation between the two countries’ research centres and universities.
Russia and Tajikistan’s cooperation includes many topical scientific and practical areas in the natural and hard sciences, mathematics and social science, as well as innovative technologies.
Our efforts to expand opportunities for receiving secondary and higher education in Russian are yielding the desired results. Today there are 39 schools in Tajikistan with Russian as the language of instruction, with about 27,000 students. There are also more than 160 mixed Tajik-Russian schools with about 70,000 pupils.
At the same time, in accordance with state standards, teaching of the Russian language is obligatory in the curriculum, and starting from second grade, it is studied in all general education schools – about 4,000 of them.
Today Russian teachers teach Tajik children in our educational institutions as part of a separate social project.
In this context, providing our schools with textbooks and manuals is still a topical issue. Russian-Tajik (Slavonic) University operates productively in Dushanbe, under the auspices of the two countries. In addition, branches of such prestigious Russian universities as Moscow State University, Moscow Power Engineering Institute and MISiS [National University of Science and Technology] are successfully operating in Tajikistan.
In general, considering students of RTSU and the branches of Russian universities I have mentioned, the number of Tajik young people getting a Russian education is more than 30,000, and about 25,000 citizens of Tajikistan are currently studying in over 700 universities in Russia.
Graduates of Russian universities are in high demand in various sectors of the national economy. They are the reason for the constantly growing pool of qualified applicants for jobs in the civil service, diplomacy, science and education, as well as culture and the arts.
We are interested in further expanding cooperation in the sphere of higher education. We welcome the opening of new branches of Russian universities in Tajikistan, which could train specialists in fields that are vital for our country’s development.
We are grateful to the Russian side for annually giving us an education quota in a wide range of disciplines that are in demand in our country.
Today the quota has reached 700, and the President and I have agreed that it will be increased up to 1,000.
As we consistently implement the government’s language policy, we are careful to take an integrated approach to the development of the Russian language along with the state language. And this is no accident. As you know, according to the Tajikistani Constitution, Russian has the status of a language of interethnic communication.
Two years ago, the CIS Heads of State Council decided to declare 2023 the Year of the Russian Language. In this connection, we agreed to take additional measures to support and develop Russian in the Commonwealth countries, including Tajikistan.
In general, I would like to emphasise that Tajikistan is interested in further developing the full range of cultural contacts with Russia. In this context, the Government of Tajikistan is committed to adopting the necessary measures to expand cooperation between the educational, scientific and research institutions of the two countries, including in the sphere of training scientists and teachers.
Mr Putin,
Assembled guests,
In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to the builders and everyone who worked hard to make this project to build schools in Dushanbe, Khujand, Tursunzoda, Kulob, and Bokhtar a reality.
I would like to extend my best wishes to representatives of one of the most noble professions – our teachers, who begin their work in these educational institutions today. I believe that the knowledge gained by schoolchildren within these walls will help turn them into creators, who will ensure the sustainable development and prosperity of the country.
Best wishes also to our schoolchildren, who begin their studies in these institutions.
I am sure that both parents and children are very happy to get such a gift on Knowledge Day, which is celebrated today everywhere in Tajikistan.
I would also like to wish success and all the best to everyone involved in today’s important event.
Thank you for your attention.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon,
Dear teachers, pupils and parents,
I will begin with what my good, longtime friend, President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon ended his speech – I will wish all of you a happy beginning of a new academic year.
By a good tradition, we – both Russia and Tajikistan – consider September 1 the Day of Knowledge and a day of celebration. Symbolically, on this day, the Republic of Tajikistan has opened five new schools with instruction in Russian, and, as was mentioned, based on Russian education programmes and standards.
As was also noted, President Rahmon and I agreed to implement this large joint project in 2019, and we have kept it under permanent control since then. I remember how Mr Rahmon criticised me, out of friendship, for not paying enough attention to areas of humanitarian cooperation.
Mr Rahmon, we are getting better.
President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon:
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I believe we are attending a good, very kindly event today.
In a relatively short time, modern schools that can accept almost 5,000 Tajik children were built in five Tajik cities: Dushanbe, Khujand, Bokhtar, Kulob and Tursunzoda.
The new schools have been equipped based on the latest practices for organising the education process, and they meet the latest seismic safety requirements. They can withstand a 9-point earthquake, which is vital for Tajikistan. I would like to convey special thanks for this to the Russian engineers, designers and builders and all our Tajik friends that took part in building these schools.
I am convinced that the schools built with Russia's help will become a welcoming home for students, and the teachers, including those from Russia – a question that President Rahmon also raised a few years ago – about sending teachers to Tajikistan, we did it too, I remember, Mr Rahmon, it was your request – so with the help of our teachers, students will discover for themselves the wonderful world of Russian language and literature. Our teachers will introduce the achievements of Russian and world science and culture to Tajik children, help them put to use their talents and interests, get to know each other, and find friends among their peers in Russia and other CIS countries, and provide them with a path to adulthood.
We are pleased to note the growing interest among citizens of Tajikistan in education in Russian. This trend is largely a result of the fact that, as already mentioned, the Constitution of Tajikistan gives Russian the special status of a language of inter-ethnic communication.
As is well known, the Russian language in general education schools in Tajikistan is studied, and I want to emphasise this, as early as second grade. There are 39 general education institutions with Russian participation in the Republic, and 160 schools have opened classes with Russian language instruction.
Our humanitarian project Russian Teacher Abroad has been running successfully in Tajikistan for six years now. In the framework of this project, 76 Russian teachers will teach the Russian language, mathematics, natural sciences and information technology in Tajikistan’s schools.
With Russian support, Tajikistan also regularly conducts geography and ecology quizzes, and the Victory Quiz.
By the way, I should mention that our countries actively cooperate in higher education, as the President of Tajikistan has just said. Every year, citizens of Tajikistan have the opportunity to study at Russian universities at the expense of the Russian budget. No money is spared for this, as it brings our countries and peoples closer together and trains workers for Tajikistan. People educated in Russia will be committed to strengthening our cooperation in the long term.
In the 2022-2023academic year, the quota has increased by 100 spots, reaching 750, and next year it will be even higher.
Russian-Tajik University and affiliates of several Russian universities are training qualified personnel, as was just mentioned. I want to cite this figure – overall, there are already 30,000 students from Tajikistan at Russian universities.
Returning to the current event, I would like to stress that the opening of five new Russian schools in Tajikistan is a momentous event for our bilateral relations, and that this is a clear indication of the long and sincere friendship between the Russian and Tajik nations, and of the partnership and alliance between our states.
Russian-Tajikistani relations are growing stronger every day. They are continuously replenished with joint, mutually beneficial projects in the humanitarian, education and other areas.
The Days of Tajik Culture will open in Russia soon, on September 24.
Mr Rahmon, I would like to tell you that at yesterday’s meeting with the Mayor of Moscow, Mr Sobyanin said that Moscow has resolved the issue you raised – to provide you with a building of your choice in the centre of Moscow to host a cultural centre. Mr Sobyanin said the Moscow government will foot the bill for it.
We are also planning to hold, before the end of this year, a bilateral youth forum devoted to the development of inter-cultural dialogue and the creation of a common humanitarian space.
All these major initiatives would not have been possible without the keen attention of Tajikistan’s leadership and the President.
I would like to convey my sincere gratitude for this to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon and all of our Tajik friends and colleagues, and to thank them especially for their assistance and support in preserving and promoting the status of the Russian language in Tajikistan.
In conclusion, I would like, of course, to wish good marks to the students of these new schools, self-fulfillment and new discoveries.
Thank you.
