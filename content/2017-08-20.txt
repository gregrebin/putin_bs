President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, friends. I would like to convey my heartfelt greetings to all of you, but first I would like to express my gratitude to the festival’s organisers.
I believe this wonderful festival was held for the first time 15 years ago, in 2003. Since then, 150 leading musical groups from all over the world have performed here, and this time you will be able to listen to 10 glorious groups, 10 jazz bands who are our friends.
Music is a kind of Esperanto, an international language that needs no translation, a language that brings people together.
We are grateful to our guests, the musicians and also the festival’s organisers. Congratulations on this wonderful festival.
All the best!
