President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today, I suggest reviewing the instruction I gave a while ago after certain tragic events that involved firearms. We will not go into details now – in fact, there have been several incidents, and we agreed to prepare proposals on additional measures to ensure public order and to prevent arms trafficking offences.
Let us return to this issue today. I would like to hear detailed reports from Minister of the Interior Vladimir Kolokoltsev and Commander of the National Guard Troops Viktor Zolotov. Please tell us what measures you think are necessary to bring this matter under control.
