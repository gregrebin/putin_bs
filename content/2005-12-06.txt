Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister!
Dear Indian friends!
Allow me to greet you warmly once again to the Kremlin.
Since last year's summit we have begun a large programme to develop cooperation and relations on various levels. We can confidently say that time was not spent in vain and that our relations are considerably closer than they were last year. This concerns cooperation on international issues, military and technical cooperation and the struggle against terrorism. Our economic relations are also developing.
Their volume is growing. However, we both know and have already spoken about this many timesâ€”today's volume does not correspond to its full potential. Both the magnitude and quality of our economic relations should be improved. Dear Mr Prime Minister, we hold great hopes for your visit. I am confident that it will act as a good impulse, first and foremost regarding our economic cooperation. The central issues concerning our economic relations are their magnitude, diversification, cooperation and mutual investment.
Manmohan Singh: Your excellency President Putin!
Dear members of the Russian delegation!
I wish to express my gratitude for the warm reception and hospitality with which you received me and my delegation in the beautiful city of Moscow.
Mr President, the talks in a narrow format which we have just finished were very useful, productive and took place in a typically warm, friendly atmosphere of mutual trust.
Your excellency, India considers Russia a trusted and constant friend. Russia has always stood beside us during hard times. Our special ties with Russia will remain unaffected by other changes in international relations or any changes in India's relations with other countries.

Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister!
Allow me to warmly welcome you to Moscow. It is a great honour for us to receive the head of state of India, a country which we consider one of our friends.
Relations between India and the Russian Federation have a very strategic character and we also note that their quality is constantly improving.
Mr Prime Minister, we know that we have problems we should address. For example, there is still a great deal to do in the development of our trade and economic relations. I am confident that during your visit we will be able to talk about our international cooperation, the struggle against terrorism, our political relations and to revive the development of our trade and economic relations.
Welcome!
Manmohan Singh: Your Excellency!
Allow me to thank you from the bottom of my heart for such a warm reception in Russia. I completely agree with you that Indian-Russian relations are special ones. For us, Russia is a trusted and constant friend. We highly value our friendship which has now also become a strategic partnership. These mutual relations are very important for us.
Your excellency, you have made a very significant personal contribution to strengthening the strategic partnership between Russia and India. I come on behalf of the government and the people to thank you in person for the significant personal contribution you have made towards strengthening relations between our countries.
