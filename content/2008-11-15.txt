President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Prime Minister,
The G-20 summit has just ended with very positive results. The countries taking part have shown the will and desire to overcome the crisis (that has spread through the financial system today and has perhaps not yet reached its peak), and we need to double our efforts now in this work.
Some steps have already been taken but we still have the bulk of the work before us. We will meet again soon and continue to discuss all of these problems and continue our efforts to resolve the issues that we discussed today.
This kind of event also gives us the chance to discuss the bilateral relations between Russia and Britain. There is great potential in our relations and there are also problems that have built up.
I am pleased to have this opportunity and I would like to discuss with you all of the issues of concern to our countries.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown (Retranslated from Russian): Mr President,
First of all, I want to say I am grateful for this chance to meet.
There is indeed a wide range of problems and issues that we should discuss, including issues concerning our bilateral relations.
I want to note that todayâ€™s G-20 summit is a historic event, a historic meeting. We have succeeded in bringing together the leaders of countries representing different continents to discuss the economic crisis that is affecting us all. I am worried about how this crisis is spreading in many countries, especially in the developing markets.
