President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Royal Highness, friends, good afternoon. We are very happy to see you in Moscow.
We cannot boast of particularly extensive economic relations, but we have always had good diplomatic and political relations with your country, Bahrain. It was a great pleasure to receive your father, the King of Bahrain, in 2008. I ask you to pass on my warmest wishes to His Majesty. 
I hope your visit to our country will be a success, and that your meetings with the Russian Federation Government will be of a good and productive level.
Your Royal Highness, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss with you your assessment of the situation in the region in general. I am referring to all the different aspects of this rather complex process – the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the situation in Egypt (I would be interested to know your government’s views) and the situation in Syria and in Iran. 
Welcome, Your Royal Highness.
Crown Prince of Bahrain Salman Bin Hamad al-Khalifa: Thank you Mr President, for receiving me and my delegation. I know you have a very busy schedule.
I would like to convey the greetings of His Majesty, who instructed me to make all efforts necessary to improve and deepen the ties between our two countries.
I would like to say that we have achieved success already in the fields of military cooperation, in signing a memorandum of understanding with the national Direct Investment Fund, RDIF, and starting the first direct flights from our national carrier Gulf Air to Moscow. 
Mr President, it is the right time and I think that it is past due that we should build and develop these relations between our countries.
I am 44 years old and I am embarrassed to say that this is my first visit. Your country is beautiful. I have been touched by the people of Russia and by the culture of Russia, by the architecture and history.
