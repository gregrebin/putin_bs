Peruvian President Alan Garcia Perez (Retranslated from Russian): Mr President, please accept our heartfelt greetings. This is the first time a Russian President visits Peru. This is a great day for us. We are very grateful to you for being here, in Peru, and for attending the APEC [summit]. We are certain that this will further consolidate our relations.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President, I am very happy to be the first Russian President to visit Peru. This is both a pleasure and an honour. This certainly shows that our relations are developing and have very good prospects.
I would like to congratulate you especially on the brilliant organisation of the APEC summit. Everything turned out to be very meaningful. In my opinion, all the work you have done was well worth the effort. I think all the delegations are very happy with it.
Today, we will work to develop Russian-Peruvian relations, which is also very important for our countries.
Once again, thank you for your hospitality.
