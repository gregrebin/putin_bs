The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: I have signed laws on ratifying agreements with Italy and France on establishing a simplified system of issuing visas for individual categories of citizens. These agreements will come into force in the same way as the similar agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany. We see these documents as a move towards developing relations with the European Union as a whole, promoting movement of people and contact between people, and construction of the four “main spaces” on which we conduct dialogue with our colleagues in the European Union. And I would ask the Foreign Minister to also say a few words about this. Please give us your comments.
Sergei Lavrov: Thank you, you have said essentially everything. The following rather broad categories come under the agreements which have already been ratified and which have now come into effect since you signed the appropriate laws: businessmen, and participants of academic, educational, cultural and sport exchanges. So a sound basis has indeed been laid to introduce new approaches to exchanges at all levels within the framework of the European Union. Currently, talks are underway with the European Union on a similar system as the first step towards introducing visa-free exchanges for all countries in the European Union. So the agreement that has come into effect, in addition to the similar agreement with Germany, is a major contribution in work to ensure that there are no divisive lines in Europe and no obstacles for people.
Mr Putin: Thank you.
