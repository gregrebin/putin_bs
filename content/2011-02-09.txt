Regional Development Minister Viktor Basargin: Mr President,
We are basically halfway through this programme, which is among those few that have not been sequestered during the financial crisis. In other words, we are talking about 18 billion rubles [over $600 million] of financing, including 14 billion from the federal budget. Today’s volume of financing stands at exactly 9 billion rubles, just as planned. In 2009–2010, 14 facilities were launched, representing basically infrastructure projects, including social infrastructure, a day care centre (including the one you visited), and housing construction. There are also a number of other facilities pertaining to infrastructure development and support, everything that has to do with hydropower industry, the islands’ new competitive advantages, hydrothermal vents, and the development of this entire area.
I will say that overall, the programme is being implemented in full. Today, we clearly see three priorities here.
The first one concerns infrastructure development to offer the economy more support, including airports development, road building, construction of energy facilities, and communication development. We have examined the implementation of all of these programmes and looked at the new areas being developed in this regard, including by regional authorities.
We also analysed the second component, the social one, which concerns the construction of housing. Unfortunately, as you know, there was virtually no housing market there before your visit. In other words, housing was not bought or built. We are just now seeing the very first housing projects being implemented under various social programmes. We looked into how to create a housing market there, how to support the construction today.
”We would certainly like to develop good relations with all of our neighbours, including cooperation in a wide range of areas on the Kuril Islands.“
Mr Serdyukov and I also discussed everything pertaining to lowering [housing] prices. Unfortunately, they are still quite high there – more than 70,000 [rubles] per square metre.
And the third area has to do with competitive advantages, the islands’ specialisation – the development of the fishing industry. We took a look at the construction of new deep-water port areas in Yuzhno-Kurilsk, Kurilsk, on Iturup and Kunashir, which will provide the foundation for creating the entire fish-processing infrastructure, with refrigerating and processing plants and companies, and fish breeding enterprises.
I will say that there are certain projects in all of these areas. I’d like to note that after your visit, the attitude among the residents and investors has changed completely. We met with members of both groups, and they have expectations for things to get better. They understand that today they are in a zone of increased attention on the part of the federal authorities. They see that the investment volumes are increasing, that the islands’ specialisation is being promoted with investors buying ships today. I visited some of the fishing ships there. Investors are putting money into developing coastal infrastructure facilities. And naturally, the government is working to develop infrastructure and social facilities. It has been proposed to keep these programmes running.
There is a certain deficit of funds. The reason is that the programme was developed back in 2006–2007, based on similar projects; there was no draft documentation, and to a great extent, today’s technologies have really changed. For many facilities, particularly all our airport facilities, landing strips are designed for entirely different aircraft. All of this needs to be updated and improved.
We did the calculations and we agree with the Governor of Sakhalin Region who says that this programme needs additional 13 billion rubles for its implementation. My colleagues from other departments and I think that we need some 8 billion rubles in additional funding to develop the entire infrastructure.
But what is perhaps the most complicated thing is that this year we need to find some 1.5 billion rubles in additional funding in order not to stop operations at many facilities, including transport infrastructure, road construction and the fuel complex.
”These islands are part of the Russian Federation, falling fully and wholly under our sovereignty, and we will make all the necessary efforts to strengthen our presence on the Kuril Islands.“
Dmitry Medvedev: All the programmes that were approved must be implemented. At the same time, if additional funding is needed, then we certainly need to assess these needs, analyse the situation, and make the necessary decisions. You can consider this my instruction as President.
At the same time, we must increase these islands’ investment appeal. Indeed, these are unique islands, and they have a good potential not only for developing geothermal energy, fish breeding or processing, although these are their key business lines. These islands also offer some highly interesting tourist opportunities, and to develop them, we need a full-fledged, solid, modern infrastructure. We need to bring in investors, attract them by offering certain terms and conditions, and we should consider creating some additional economic advantages. Incidentally, I suggested this to everyone, including our neighbours, who might make use of these opportunities.
Thus, all of these programmes must be implemented in a timely manner. Please continue your work. I stated our main goal while visiting the islands, which is to make people living there feel just as comfortable as people living on the mainland, and for these islands to have prospects for development. This is the most important thing.
But these islands also serve as our eastern border, and a very important one. We have troops stationed there as well. Mr Serdyukov, I instructed you to visit the corresponding islands. What are your impressions, and what do you plan to do?
Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov: Following your instructions, I visited the 18 Machine Gun-Artillery Division on February 4; the division commander reported to me on combat readiness of the troops and the activities the division was engaged in at that time.
