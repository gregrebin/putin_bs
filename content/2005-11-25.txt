President Vladimir Putin: Boris Vyacheslavovich [Gryzlov], I would like to begin today’s meeting with a discussion of the draft law currently being examined in the State Duma, the draft law on non-governmental organisations.
I agree with those of our colleagues who consider it unacceptable that some organisations are being financed from abroad to carry out what amounts to political activity here in Russia. Whether these organisations want it or not, they become an instrument in the hands of foreign states that use them to achieve their own political objectives with regard to our country, and this situation is, of course, unacceptable.
But at the same time, I very much hope that the discussions on this draft law in the State Duma will lead to a balanced decision and that the Duma deputies will ensure that the law that is passed will not be to the detriment of civil society in Russia and to cooperation between Russian non-governmental organisations and their colleagues abroad on very important humanitarian, cultural, educational, environmental and other issues that it is in Russia’s own interests to resolve.
I very much hope that the decisions you reach will, as I said, be balanced and carefully weighed.
Chairman of The State Duma Boris Gryzlov: Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin], when we examined this draft law in the first reading we focused on the fact that we are creating a common legal framework for all legal entities working in the Russian Federation. There is no question here of discriminating against non-governmental and public organisations. What is more, the demands this law and the registration procedures it sets out place on public organisations are of an informational nature. If these organisations really do have serious objectives, I am sure they will be able to draw up a charter setting out their goals. We are not asking for more than this: they only need to draw up a charter and register it through a procedure of notification.
We will certainly examine the proposals currently being discussed, including in the media. There are also new members of the Public Council who have already made proposals on this matter, and we shall certainly examine possible amendments to the draft law in the second reading. We will ensure that the law is as balanced as possible.
