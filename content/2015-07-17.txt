With leader of the Communist Party faction in the State Duma, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Gennady Zyuganov.
Mr Zyuganov
briefed the President, in particular, on the results of the State Duma’s spring session, implementation of the law on industrial policy, import replacement in the agriculture sector, and the KPRF’s participation in organising summer holidays for children.
On the subject of agriculture, Mr Zyuganov spoke about development at agricultural enterprises overseen by the KPRF. He also proposed organising a national-level seminar on developing rural areas against the backdrop of sanctions and the difficulties in the global economy, and then discussing the results achieved in the agriculture sector at the State Council.
Mr Zyuganov also noted that US media have lessened their criticism of Russia lately and expressed the view that the US has lowered its demands on Russia, and is more willing to enter into dialogue now. Mr Zyuganov said that Russia should be more active in developing its relations with countries to the east and south, while at the same time maintaining its ties with Europe.
The discussion with Mr Zyuganov is part of the meetings the President holds every year with leaders of the different parliamentary factions following the end of the State Duma’s spring session.
