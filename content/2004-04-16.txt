Vladimir Putin: Mr Medvedchuk, you know our position. Our contacts with Ukraine are our topmost priority, even among our most important issues at hand. We will certainly accept any decision the Ukrainian people take and will interact with any government. Of course, we would expect continuity in the future. We understand that Ukraine is currently going through a difficult process. We will make every effort to uphold the level of relations that we have reached over the past few years and that we certainly prize here in Russia. We will keep in touch with President Leonid Kuchma. We have recently agreed on the phone to maintain a dialogue. So now I would like to discuss with you the details of that dialogue, including the time, place and format of the meetings.
