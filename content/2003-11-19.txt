Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty,
Allow me to wish you a warm welcome to Moscow.
Russia and Jordan have ongoing and regular consultations, and we are very pleased with this. We are very happy that you have come here today. This will give us a chance to discuss our bilateral relations in the economic sphere and in military-technical cooperation, and, of course, it will also give us the opportunity to discuss the whole complex knot of problems regarding regulation in the Middle East and the current situation in Iraq.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for the support you have given Russia in its desire to establish ties with the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.
King Abdullah II of Jordan: Mr President,
I would like to say that it is a great honour to meet with you here in your country. I would like to note your personal contribution to developing bilateral relations between Jordan and Russia and also the great contribution that your country is making to strengthening peace and stability in the Middle East.
For all of us, your constant presence in the region, involvement in the regionâ€™s affairs, your work towards strengthening peace and stability and regulating Israeli-Palestinian relations and the situation in Iraq is a very important factor.
I hope that we will be able to discuss today a whole range of major issues, both bilateral and regional, and I would like to express our gratitude for the contribution you are making to peace and security in our region.
