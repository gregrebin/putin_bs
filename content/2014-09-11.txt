President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Mr Putin, I am very happy to meet with you.
Dushanbe is hosting the SCO summit these days. Naturally, this is a good opportunity to discuss what our organisation has done and what we can improve within the SCO framework for our peoples and our nations.
At the same time, this is a good opportunity to discuss our bilateral issues as well. I think we have accumulated a fair number of them, but these are good topics, issues of growth and development in our relations. So I am very happy about our meeting and would like to first hear your thoughts on this.
Welcome.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Rahmon.
I know that a great deal of care and work is involved in organising this major event. And we can see that you have prepared for it and are conducting it brilliantly – in any case, we can see the brilliant beginning of our talks in expanded format. Thank you very much for this.
As for bilateral relations, they are developing quite successfully; based on the results for January-July of this year, we are expecting our trade to grow by more than 60%. Naturally, this is an impressive indicator.
But we will discuss it now in detail. We certainly have things we could work on more to improve these indicators.
Our inter-parliamentary ties are developing, and we have some progress in the humanitarian sector as well.
We view Tajikistan as a very close partner and ally. These are not just strategic relations; they are allied relations. We greatly value this and intend to continue working in the same key.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am very happy to have this bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SCO
summit. We marked an important date in June – the 10th anniversary of the intergovernmental strategic partnership agreement of June 16, 2004. During these years, we have achieved a great deal in enhancing our cooperation based on the principles of pragmatic cooperation, equality and mutual respect for each other’s interests.
We maintain regular contacts at various levels both bilaterally and within such multilateral organisations as the CIS
, SCO and the UN. We hold regular summit meetings. This is good and we expect the mechanism we have created in the past few years will help our further development in the economy, politics and humanitarian cooperation.
Our countries are linked by years and even centuries of friendship and cooperation. I am certain that we will move ahead using this positive capital as a foundation.
I am very happy to see you.
President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov
: Thank you, Mr President, I am very happy to have this meeting with you today.
Due to this year’s turbulent events, the schedule of our meetings has shifted somewhat, even the regular planned events that took place in the previous years. I will be frank and say that our meetings have become even more significant in the sense that many issues come up and it is important that we meet and exchange views on them.
Frankly speaking, I fully agree with you in that our meetings always give me food for thought. And when these meetings are too far apart, I find myself somewhat at a loss. There are questions I need to ask you to find some guidelines.
Russia is our strategic partner, and I realise there are those for whom this expression is just empty words to be used on formal occasions, when they talk about “our relations of strategic partnership and alliance”. I believe the meaning of this phrase is that we should seek each other’s advice more often and try to get answers to our questions so as not to find ourselves at a loss.
From this point of view, I believe our working meetings should be truly regular, and if we have any questions, we should raise them, get answers, and discuss things if we need to. Sometimes these discussions may not be very pleasant, but I would rather have a discussion than wander in the dark groping for information in some dark corners.
Today it is easy to be influenced by the media lies. True information is exchanged face to face. When you ask a question and hear the answer, you can find your true bearings.
Therefore, I am very happy to have this meeting despite your tight schedule – I was told you only had half an hour for this meeting. Even this half hour is of double value for me, because we have accumulated many questions. I am grateful to you for this opportunity to meet on the sidelines of the SCO summit. I think this is very timely and necessary. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: This is the first time I hear about the half hour. I suppose our colleagues are too lazy to work with us. We have never had any time limits, and we do not have them today either.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, we are grateful for your initiative to meet in this format, and I am sure the President of the People’s Republic of China will confirm this.
We have recently visited Mongolia with great success. My visit was timed to the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. I would like to note in this connection that Russia and China bore the brunt of the attack from both Nazi Germany and militarist Japan. The events of those years are close to our hearts, despite the fact that they occurred over 70 years ago. Mongolia actively helped the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War and we will always remember that.
Next year we will be marking 70 years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War. I already had the pleasure of inviting the Presidents of the People’s Republic of China and Mongolia to visit Moscow during these gala events. I would like to confirm my invitation.
Naturally, the geographic proximity of Mongolia, Russia and China help us implement beneficial long-term projects in infrastructure, energy and mining. We have things to discuss and we find it important, feasible and useful to establish a regular dialogue.
I would also like to thank Tajikistan for giving us the opportunity to meet in this format today.
Thank you.

The two leaders discussed pressing issues of bilateral cooperation, particularly in energy, aircraft engineering and infrastructure.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, my friend, our Chinese friends, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you.
This is our fourth meeting this year with President Xi Jinping. We always have things to talk about. Relations between our states are developing actively. We are promoting practically all of our major projects; we are working according to plan and opening up new prospects and new opportunities.
Only recently, as you may know, we have launched a new major project in the Russian Far East, and my recent visit to China resulted in a breakthrough on this project. This was done with the direct support of the President of China. Now we have practically begun its implementation, which, I am certain, will proceed in the same business-like manner and will be efficiently carried through by both parties – Russia and the People’s Republic of China. I am referring to the new gas pipeline system to China. This will help resolve many issues in both the actively developing Chinese provinces and in the Russian Far East.
We are making headway in other traditional areas of cooperation as well, including nuclear power, aircraft engineering, infrastructure and so forth.
We are very glad to see you and we hope that the SCO summit will also provide many benefits for our joint work.
President of The People’S Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): Mr President,
I am very happy to see you once again. Last month, right after the earthquake in Yunnan province in China you sent me a telegram of condolences. On your instructions Russia’s Emergencies’ Ministry delivered humanitarian cargo to the disaster area. This yet again demonstrated the sincere friendship between our peoples. I thank you from all my heart.
All the government agencies and local authorities in both countries are working to implement the agreements we have reached at the meetings in Shanghai and Fortaleza. Bilateral relations and cooperation are developing actively and successfully in various areas. Early this month you personally took part in the ceremony to launch the construction of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, which shows how seriously you take the expansion of Chinese-Russian energy cooperation.
On my instructions our Deputy Prime Minister Zhang Gaoli attended the ceremony, which was a success and served as a stimulus and an example for strengthening Chinese-Russian cooperation in various spheres.
We have set up an intergovernmental Chinese-Russian commission on investment cooperation. We are actively considering cooperation in the construction of high-speed railways. We have launched cooperation in satellite navigation systems, which you personally have given great attention to.
There is new progress in the joint development of long-haul jumbo jets and heavy helicopters, as well as other major joint projects.
I am ready to maintain further contacts with you to strengthen mutual support and expand openness between our countries, so that we could always draw from each other’s support, jointly face external challenges and achieve our grand development and revival goals.
