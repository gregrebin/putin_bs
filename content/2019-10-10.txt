Speech at the plenary session of the International Forum Russia – Country of Sports
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,
We are delighted to welcome the leaders of the global sports community, the heads of international sports organisations, top athletes and all our colleagues and partners who are interested, just as we are, in promoting successful and confident development of sports and in preserving the humanitarian potential of sports and the basic principles of accessibility, equality and honest and fair competition.
The continued promotion of the noble sports values, which unite the world, is a key goal of our large and multinational sports family. We must work together to attain this goal based on the tried and tested norms and rules, hear and respect each other and develop a constructive and friendly dialogue.
The International Forum Russia – Country of Sports is intended to promote exactly such an approach to our common and possibly even great cause. The first such forum was held 10 years ago, but its format is still in demand, while an opportunity to freely exchange information and access to open discussion platforms are becoming increasingly important.
Sport has long become an integral part of social life, and it is society that should determine its development vectors and global agenda. In particular, society should propose new sports and new forms of competition for the international calendar of official sports events, those which are really interesting for the people and which encourage them to take up sports and live an active and healthy life.

At the plenary session of the Russia – Country of Sports International Forum.
Russia has proposed holding CIS Games, and the first such games will be held in Kazan in August 2020. We have also supported the idea of BRICS Games, which will be held next year in Chelyabinsk, in the Urals.
Open sports competitions in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) have good prospects as well. We are happy that close cooperation with our partners in these authoritative international venues cover sports as well. Our colleagues enthusiastically supported all our proposals.
Let me repeat that Russia has always been and remains ready for cooperation on all issues on the global sports agenda. We try to use the best practices in organising sports events, and we have effectively used innovations and other scientific achievements in sports.
For our part, we will share our experience in holding events, from small tournaments to major global championships.
Naturally, Russia, a country that has given sports hundreds of outstanding names and records, and whose athletes set new sports records, despite everything, remains one of the leading participants in sports.
We are constantly in contact with the International Olympic and Paralympic committees, and the relevant UNESCO and Council of Europe agencies, where our experts take part in drafting the latest European programmes and conventions.
We also cooperate with WADA. Russia strictly complies with all of its requirements. This country and our athletes are particularly interested in leaving the setbacks linked with anti-doping issues in the past. They want to perform as equals, demonstrate their skills without any reservations and serve as examples both for professionals and for sports fans, and first and foremost, for young people.
The quality of life, the physical condition and physical ability to work have a comprehensive impact on the sustainable socioeconomic development and well-being of people in general. This is one of the reasons sports are a state priority in many countries.
I am very pleased to note that recently the World Health Organisation noted our progress in this area and indicated that in recent years Russia had sharply reduced – which is very good – the consumption of hard liquor and is more engaged in sports activities.
This led to a significant increase in life expectancy in Russia. The credit for this goes primarily to you.
I want to say a few words to my colleagues from Russia who are involved in promoting physical fitness and sport.
We plan to involve more than half of all Russian citizens in regular sports activities by 2024. We are doing our best to achieve this goal. We are building large and small sports facilities, upgrading parks, residential areas and cities with physical fitness in mind, equipping sports grounds and schools and creating athletic clubs and classes. The Russian regions and municipalities will play a major part in this work.
We will talk in detail about this with our colleagues right now during the Sports Council meeting, which will be held here, in Nizhny Novgorod and discuss ways to improve our legislation and the additional measures to be taken to make sport not just a staple activity, but a vital necessity. I am convinced we will certainly be able to achieve this goal if we work together.
Friends, colleagues, I wish you success during the forum and in your work in general, which everyone in the world and in the countries you represent need so much.
Thank you.

Speech at the meeting with heads of international sports organisations
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
Let me sincerely welcome you in Russia once again. This time we are meeting in Nizhny Novgorod. This is an ancient, very beautiful Russian city. I hope you will like it here.
You know and I have just spoken at the plenary session of the forum about Russia’s attitude to sports and our striving to reach new heights in sports that we consider very important.
Today, at the prompting of my colleagues, we reviewed our achievements and plans. Three group-stage matches and a quarterfinal of the UEFA European Football Championship will take place in St Petersburg next year.
We are getting ready to hold the world championships for luge in 2020, swimming and volleyball in 2022, ice hockey in 2023, and aquatic sports in 2025. We will also host a parachuting championship and a number of other events. So we have a large, serious agenda.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank our colleagues from abroad once again. We consider all of you – and ourselves – to be one big sports family that aims to develop mass and elite sport, primarily in the interests of people.
Sport serves the noble purpose of developing relations between nations, promoting health of the population and international cooperation. These are very important and noble goals.
Of course, we also know the problems faced by our and other athletes. We will work orderly to resolve them. I am referring to anti-doping problems.
We have cooperated and will cooperate with WADA. I am just hoping that all of these problems will be resolved on the basis of equality and in accordance with the current sports legislation, and that nobody will be discriminated against for political reasons because the purpose of sports is to unite countries and people rather than divide them.
I am very happy to welcome all of you once again. I would like to wish you success. I hope we will have a straightforward, open discussion. We, my colleagues and I, will be pleased to answer any of your questions.

The discussion focused on the role of the regions and municipalities in promoting a healthy lifestyle and having 55 percent of the country's population involved in regular physical fitness by 2024.
Mechanisms for achieving national goals and resolving strategic issues in physical fitness and sport in the regions and the necessary changes in the area of sport were also discussed.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
This time we are meeting in Nizhny Novgorod. It is an old and beautiful Russian city. It has been the venue of various competitions and has ambitious plans. As agreed, we will be talking about the development of sports in general.
I hope that many of you attended the International Forum Russia – Country of Sports, where we met with our foreign colleagues. I had a long and very fruitful discussion with them.

Meeting with heads of international sports organisations
October 10, 2019
Although international cooperation in the field of sports is very important, our indisputable priority is the development of national sports, primarily the involvement of Russian citizens in regular physical fitness education and sports.
Our goal is to increase the number of people getting involved in regular physical activities to at least 55 percent of the total by 2024. It is an attractive figure, which we must and will certainly achieve. However, it is not the highest figure possible, even among the neighbouring countries.
I would like to say the following in this connection: We aim not so much for quantity as for quality achievements. The best gauge is good health and an active long life.
I believe it would be absolutely correct to focus the attention of the Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport on the role of the regions and the municipalities. The local authorities can see all the aspects of the sports sector better than anyone else. They know what the people want and which laws and administrative decisions should be taken to accelerate the development of physical culture and sports.
I would like to ask the heads of regions to maintain constant contact with their officials responsible for the development of physical culture and sports in municipalities. I have said many times with regard to education and healthcare that there is a gap between the competencies and responsibilities on the municipal and federal, including regional, levels of governance. It is a sphere where these discrepancies must be eliminated without any further delay. The agencies responsible for physical culture and sports must organise the necessary events on their territories and also ensure close coordination between the regional and municipal authorities.
I would like to remind you that local governments have the right and the competence to choose and implement plans for the development of physical culture and sports and that their knowledge of local conditions and possibilities, as well as their almost daily interaction with the locals, are a vital resource for adopting really effective decisions.
On the whole, the implementation of objectives set out in the national projects requires that all realisers engage in close and well-organised interaction. The overwhelming majority of the projects are of a multi-sectoral nature. The sports sphere is the best example of this, being equally important for the successful implementation of the healthcare, education and cultural programmes. It is also of importance for strengthening this country’s defence capability and even in the field of foreign policy. All things are quite closely interconnected.
It is important to create new opportunities for people to find self-fulfillment in sports and do this so that these people can be actively involved themselves. The Civic Chamber already practices debates on the performance of the Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport. The recommendations they have drawn up should be taken into account under all circumstances. Moreover, the same approach must be employed at the regional level. I would like to ask the regional authorities to fully use the potential of public involvement in addressing the sports development tasks, create, along with the residents of cities, towns and villages, ever more new opportunities and ever better conditions for engaging in sports, providing all kinds of physical culture events.
In this connection, I certainly support the proposal made by the Council’s working group to draw up and approve an interagency programme to promote physical culture and sports in the countryside, complete with modernising the existing facilities and building new multifunctional sports infrastructure.
We should pay special attention to providing it with personnel and creating a barrier-free environment. This is of extreme importance everywhere, including in the countryside.
It is also necessary to organise and support in a systemic way physical culture and sports clubs at work places and where people reside. Possibly, it is worth thinking about introducing the position of sports instructor into staff schedules of work places and municipal organisations and, of course, about measures to incentivise employees who go in for sports and, accordingly, their employers.
Particular attention needs to be paid to the future generations. In this field, it would be also expedient to create school and university sports clubs. This work should go on, because much has been done but much – or even more – is yet to be done. This must be built in into the system of competitions.
Generally, the competitions that take place in Russia should embrace all ages and fitness groups and include both national and Olympic events.
Multifaceted, large-scale competitive activities kill at least two birds with one stone.
Firstly, sports and active lifestyles among the public are promoted and the second thing is talented children who want to get themselves involved in high performance sports are found and selected.
Before the meeting, as I already mentioned, we talked to the heads of international sports organisations, and they confirmed their interest in holding major international competitions in Russia. We know only too well the positive social effect of such projects and we are ready to implement them in the future.
By the way, there has been a proposal to organise major international competitions among school pupils. Of course, this is a specific matter, and a special group of people, they are young athletes, children. In this case, obviously, we need to organise everything in accordance with the recommendations of teachers, children’s psychologists and doctors. But this is an interesting idea and I think we could support it.
With regard to the previous experience in holding world championships in Russia, I would like to ask you to outline a list of potential competitions that could be of interest to us, and to think about establishing new formats of international competitions. For instance, as I already said today, those that are aimed at expanding cooperation within BRICS, the SCO, the EurAsEc, and other multilateral organisations.
Colleagues, at the previous meeting of the Council, the Government was instructed to approve before October 2020 the Strategy for Developing Physical Fitness and Sport in Russia through 2030. I suggest we summarise the results of the current strategy and discuss the new one at the next meeting of the council, which will take place next spring.
This is what I wanted to say. I would like to give the floor to the head of the working group, Oleg Kozhemyako.
