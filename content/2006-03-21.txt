Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Hu Jintao, dear friend!
Ladies and gentlemen!
We are celebrating the beginning of the Year of Russia in the People's Republic of China. I am convinced that this is more than just a celebration – it is a significant event in all senses of the word. It reflects the positive spirit and dynamic character of our relations.
With no undue exaggeration, today Russian-Chinese relations act as examples of mutual respect and of good relations between neighbours. They are contributing towards increasing the role and influence that Russia and China have in the world, and towards modernizing our own countries.
When President Hu Jintao and I made the decision to carry out the years of Russia and China over a two-year period in our respective countries, we had more in mind than just presenting our countries' recent achievements. These events must help us attain a new level of cooperation. We see them as significant, large-scale projects that are capable of having a powerful resonance, and significantly increasing friendship and mutual understanding between the peoples of Russia and China.
We have planned over 260 events in connection with the Year of Russia in China and several dozen of them have already taken place. This comprehensive programme covers all the areas in which we cooperate: the very widest range of business partnerships as well as ties in the cultural and educational spheres.
The authorities, business and artistic communities, and normal citizens of our countries have actively supported carrying out this multifaceted event. An unprecedented number of participants is involved in implementing this event. The Russian regions have also been very active and made almost a half of the proposals with regards to organizing the Year of Russia in the People's Republic of China. Presentations of the Russian federal regions and days devoted to Moscow and St Petersburg will take place in China. We hope that the Year of Russia will be really interesting and informative and that our Chinese friends will remember it for a long time.
Dear friends!
Despite some difficult episodes in history the peoples of Russia and China have done more than just keep their good relations. Today we understand better than ever the strategic advantages of our close bilateral contacts and intend to expand them for the benefits of both our peoples.
In connection with this we have already achieved a real breakthrough in our bilateral political ties.
Russia and China are two of the largest powers in the world and our relations are more than just a factor in geopolitical stability. They are an example of an open international partnership that is not directed against any third country and that helps develop a better and more just world order.
We actively cooperate in the international arena, in leading international organizations, and we are establishing new associations.
The ascent that Russia and China are experiencing today has first and foremost resulted in the good dynamics our economic cooperation has taken on. We are presenting our achievements in this area at exhibitions in Harbin, Shenzhen and Shanghai, and we shall discuss the tasks and problems that exist in this sphere at the Russian-Chinese economic forum that will open tomorrow.
A number of events of the Year of Russia in China are designed to diversify trade and expand our partnership, also with respect to investment and regional cooperation. The Russian National Exhibition that will be held in November in Beijing will play a key role in this. I hope that all of this will help deepen the dialogue between our countries with respect to practical matters.
Today millions of people are involved in Russian-Chinese cooperation – the business and academic communities, youth and public associations are united in this effort.
These ties result in quite a large number of initiatives and new forms of cooperation such as the possibility of joint universities and postgraduate schools. We have planned a number of major events this year connected with education, something that is in such demand today both in Russia and in China. We have also planned a number of interesting projects in the fields of sport and the media.
Our cultural ties are growing. Today in Russia there are more and more people who are studying the Chinese language and who are interested in your culture. I hope that the Festival of Russian Culture will occasion just as much interest in China and I feel sure that the Festival will enrich this year.
All of this opens new possibilities and prospects for the dialogue between our peoples. And I am confident that the Year of the Russian Federation in the People's Republic of China will be one more essential stage in drawing closer together.
Thank you for your attention.
