Opening ceremony for social educational facilities in Dagestan (via videoconference).
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
My greetings to everyone, this time from the Far East.
Today is a great day, my greetings to you all on Knowledge Day. As usual, on September 1, many festive and joyful events take place around Russia related to the beginning of the new school year.
One such event is the completion of 37 new social facilities in Dagestan; 36 of them were built by military builders.
First of all, I would like to thank the leaders of the Ministry of Defence and everyone else who was involved, for their dedicated work, for building schools, kindergartens and nurseries that the region needs so badly.
I know you had to deal with some challenges, considering the seismic environment in the region, and to build in hard-to-reach and mountainous areas. But the engineers, designers, and builders have met the deadlines while ensuring the work is of high quality; they have used new technological solutions and, of course, complied with all the necessary environmental requirements.
I would like to emphasise that new schools, kindergartens, and nurseries have up-to-date equipment and technology, comfortable and convenient premises, playgrounds and sports facilities for study and recreation.
I know that the Defence Ministry is now building 37 more projects in my beloved Dagestan; 27 will open by the end of this year.
The new schools and preschool facilities will lend a strong impetus to social development in Dagestan, and will create a more comfortable environment for child guidance and education.
I would like to stress that the new up-to-date social infrastructure is being developed in Dagestan and other regions of our huge and vast country under a national project. By the end of 2023, at least 256,000 nursery places should be added around Russia. Over the past four years, the federal government has allocated more than 150 billion rubles for this purpose.
Let me repeat: we will continue developing the social and education infrastructure in all the regions and gradually make it possible for parents to send their children to a nursery or kindergarten, without queues, no matter where they live, and to have enough places at schools so that children do not have to do afternoon or even evening sessions.
I am confident that the military construction complex of the Defence Ministry will continue to contribute to such necessary work.
Let me remind you that last year, during the most difficult period of the coronavirus pandemic, military builders promptly helped Russia and quickly built 30 high-quality multipurpose medical centres. Since they opened, the 20 medical centres of the Defence Ministry alone have treated over 26,000 patients, and not just service personnel – they amounted to a little over half of those who received treatment and rehabilitation at these centres. Let me repeat: a little over half were military personnel, and the rest were civilians who needed help. This directly confirms the words that the people and the army are one. It really is so.
The military builders make a significant contribution to creating and renovating military education institutions. Over the last seven years, new facilities opened, by tradition, by the beginning of the new academic year. For example, last year on September 1, three schools opened at once: the North Caucasus and Tver Suvorov military schools, as well as a branch of the Nakhimov Naval School in Kaliningrad. And this year, new educational buildings were built at the Omsk cadet corps, one of the oldest in Russia.
Of course, this work must and will continue.
In conclusion, I would like to once again congratulate you on today’s occasion, Knowledge Day, and wish you success and all the best.

Vladimir Putin: Greetings, friends and colleagues.
I extend my greetings to you on this day and I am happy to know that today, on Knowledge Day, you got together and are building the Alliance for Protecting Children in the Digital Environment. I thank all the participating companies for such a responsible approach.
Digital technologies have widely and firmly entered our lives and have become a natural and integral part of it for children. We have this impression – you know it better than I do – that our young people are now born with the skills to manage electronic devices. They learn to handle them so quickly and confidently and have access to the internet from an early age, when they are just in preschool. All that definitely impacts the way they learn about the world, their studies at school and peer communication. But we often neglect what they do for fun and how they spend their free time. So, the content of the virtual, digital space matters most for our children’s wellbeing and safety. They must be reliably protected in this area.
Obviously, the state’s efforts, laws and regulations are not always adequate, and discussions about that are going on all the time. It is of paramount importance that society and business take an active stance and understand their role and responsibility. It is important that the online space be filled with positive educational substance. Evidently, this needs to be useful and exciting. We must act on this together, and to achieve creative solutions, we must attract leading education centres and educational platforms, parent-teacher communities and young creative teams, and also factor in the experience of children’s rights commissioners and the resources of youth and volunteer associations.
I really hope that you will manage to build a constructive dialogue with global digital platforms and cooperate to protect children in the digital environment. Many countries have already gained this experience, including European countries. Of course, it is critical that we set standards in this area ourselves.
Russia, as you well know, has a strong position in digital technologies. This is evidenced by the achievements, your achievements, achievements of our powerhouses in the world markets. And first-rate personnel training is a condition for developing and moving forward. We need to continue creating favorable conditions for these breakthrough technologies in our country. And the fact that today you prioritise the interests of children, formulate and promote moral and ethical principles in the Russian segment of the internet, speaks to the maturity of our companies promising domestic developments in digital business. And I wish you success with all my heart. I believe it is extremely important, what you are doing now, and what you are creating as an organisation that will protect our children and create conditions for their development. This is not a business goal, it is a national goal.
Thank you very much. Let’s get down to business and our discussion.

Vladimir Putin: To wrap up our meeting, I would like to highlight the following. You see, I just recalled an interview with a very famous pop singer, a world class pop star. Her performances are often controversial with regard to their perception by young people, the more so by children. And she appeared to have many children. When asked “What do your children think of what you are doing on stage?” she gave an unexpected answer. She said, “I don’t show it to them, they don’t see it.” That is, she protects her children from this content, whereas all the others do not seem to matter.
But in your business, in the business you are engaged in, it is impossible to protect your own children, grandchildren, the children of your loved ones, friends and relatives from what is happening on the internet. Therefore, the only correct conclusion and the only correct action on our part and on your part is to join efforts to protect our children from dysfunctional, harmful, evil content that has a destructive effect on them. And vice versa, to create such content and build the work of this entire system, the system of this business, your business, in such a way that it contributes to the development of the child, helps the development of the country. Thank you so much for that.
I want to wish you every success – both in your current undertaking, and in your work, your life and in your business. You will certainly succeed. For its part, the state will do everything it can to support you.
I wish you all the best.
