Meeting with representatives of the public in Kaliningrad Region.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends and colleagues.
You know that today in Kaliningrad, we will be discussing with regional governors the development of primary healthcare. Therefore, I actually wanted to meet with you just before this event to talk about it as well, but if any other questions arise, feel free – we have no protocol or any preliminary plan here.
I asked the Governor and members of the Presidential Executive Office to invite mainly those people who are somehow connected with healthcare in general, who understand and feel what is happening, especially in primary healthcare: medical workers, representatives of public organisations working in this field, and administrators one way or another related to healthcare.
Look what has happened in recent years. We have addressed several times, at least twice, the issue of improving the primary healthcare sector, healthcare in general and primary healthcare in particular. We assumed we needed to provide federal support for regions and municipalities. So we did it and spent a significant amount on it. Some time passed, and it turned out that we have to go back to this issue, again at the federal level. So we provided financial support again. Another five years passed; we had hoped that the regions and municipalities would maintain the achieved level, but it did not work out, so again we have come to a situation where additional efforts and additional funds are required on the federal level. So this is a system-wide problem.
Judging by what we see here, this is happening, in part, because there is a gap between the municipal and state levels of government in our Fundamental Law, the Constitution, which sets out the state level as the regional and federal levels, but not the municipal level. What does this mean? It means that officials at the federal level, and often at the regional level as well, say that this is not their competence and that town and village authorities are free to act as they deem necessary. Town and village authorities respond that they would be happy to do this if not for the lack of funds and suggest redistributing the financing sources. And this goes on and on.
Of course, we will have to take system-wide decisions that imply a degree of coordination but should not come into conflict with our international commitments, because the municipal authorities must have a measure of independence. We cannot and will not violate this premise, yet there must be a connection between different levels of government.
Members of the public do not even distinguish between municipal and state responsibilities. They believe that the authorities in general must ensure quality services, in this case, medical services. Actually, the situation in education is almost identical. Anyway, this is the situation. Therefore, we should plan our actions based on modern realities and respond to whatever takes place.
Unfortunately, many bad things are taking place because primary care needs federal assistance again. But for the planned allocations to be used wisely and with the best possible effect, we must jointly formulate the rules, forms, methods and volumes – primarily volumes and only then methods – of spending these funds, so that the people see and feel improvements in the quality of medical services.
As you know, our national projects include a Healthcare project. Quite a large amount of money has been allocated until 2024: 1.3 trillion rubles. But this national project was developed in such a way that mainly… It envisages a bit for the primary healthcare sector, somewhere around 300 billion, if I am not mistaken. Well, not a little bit – 277, isn’t that right?
Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova
: 237.
Vladimir Putin: 237 billion. But this is not enough. This is for six years, until 2024, and given the situation that has developed in primary healthcare, this is clearly not enough.
Where does the main part of the funding go? To things that are quite necessary, one would say. They include first of all the fight against cancer – the main funds go there. This covers federal centres, interregional centres – these are large regional healthcare institutions. But fortunately, most people, 80 or 85 percent, do not need cancer treatment, but they do need a local outpatient clinic or some kind of inter-district institution to receive high-quality medical assistance on a regular basis. If that is the case, fewer people will need to receive treatment at hi-tech centres, because there will be fewer cases when the disease progresses to an advanced stage.
This is what I wanted to say at the beginning. The goal of our meeting and discussion today is to listen to you – the people who work with patients directly, and, having heard you, to take what you say into account when developing and implementing programmes for primary healthcare, which is the reason we have gathered here in Kaliningrad today.
That is all I wanted to say. Let us begin.
I want to repeat, if you have any non-health issues you want to raise, please go ahead. But I would very much like to talk about this topic, because today’s State Council Presidium meeting is devoted to it, and the professional community in this field has gathered here today.

Opening remarks at expanded meeting of State Council Presidium
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today, we have gathered in an expanded format: the governors of the majority of Russian regions are present here. Our task is to analyse the record of the regions in healthcare.
I know that you arrived here in advance and discussed these issues with the heads of the federal government bodies and the expert community. I also had the pleasure of meeting with a number of specialists who deal with these issues on behalf of public organisations and work in primary healthcare.

At the beginning of our meeting, I would like to say, and this is fair, that much has been achieved in the field of healthcare over the past few years. Steady growth of life expectancy is a very important indicator that shows positive changes in our healthcare system. Thus, in 2014, it was 70.9 years and in August of this year, it was 73.6 years. The World Health Organisation has confirmed these figures and the growth rates.
Of course, this is a result of strenuous efforts, productive work of doctors, medical organisations, scientists and talented teams in many regions. They have made an enormous contribution to the development of high technology and specialised medical assistance, and to the resolution of very complicated tasks in maternal and child health.
I would like to emphasise once again, all our achievements confirm that we are able and at the same time obliged to do more, moreover, to consider the high and constantly growing needs of society. Actually, it is clear to everyone – I am referring now not just to healthcare but to any area in general – that we assess today’s conditions not by how bad it was yesterday but based on today’s needs and depending on what we must and would like to achieve tomorrow. Yesterday’s achievements are often seen as normal today; this is only fair.
Today over 60 percent of our citizens have a low opinion of the quality of healthcare, mostly primary healthcare.
I would like to repeat that for us this demand means we need to seriously improve our performance in this area.
You know that since August we have held a series of meetings on this subject and discussed the problems that are vital to people, including the limited quality of primary healthcare institutions, that is, medical and obstetrical stations, infirmaries, outpatient clinics and district hospitals. Many buildings were built in the middle of the past century and have not been repaired for many, many years. Diagnostic equipment is often scarce, and practically all of them are short on personnel.
Following these meetings and in accordance with the instructions I gave to the Government, the plans for upgrading primary healthcare have been endorsed. Based on these, the regions must draft their regional programmes before January 10 and adopt them before July 1.

You know how things are in your regions. Primary healthcare is primarily the responsibility of the regional authorities, and you certainly have your own views on resolving these accumulated problems. I would like today’s discussion to be to the point and absolutely sincere.
Essentially, primary care is closest to the patients and is crucial for them. Most of the patients’ claims are fair and justified. In cases where little has changed for the better, this has become particularly clear. When the local authorities rush into optimisation and often do so in a perfunctory manner making access to medical care more complicated, it only makes the situation worse.
Take, for example, an outpatient clinic with therapists conveniently located not far from a person’s home. But then, the specialist doctors and diagnostic equipment are often located either at the other end of town, or even in a neighbouring district. No doubt, such logistics are good for cutting costs, but they ignores patient needs and interests and do not make medical services readily available.
Given these circumstances, some patients might take their time and wait, others will have patience and wait in line, but still others will get frustrated and put it off. As a result, this could lead to a serious illness or serious complications.
A lot depends on the primary care physicians’ experience, knowledge and skills, and their focus on patients. However, often a doctor may have to see up to 30 patients in one shift and – doctors know this better than anyone else does – fill out a stack of papers as well. We touched on this in our conversation earlier.
Doctors and paramedical staff are the ones who bear the brunt of responsibility for the health of every patient, and thereby, of our nation. Creating the proper environment for them to be able to properly perform their medical duties is our common and most important task.
Also, we must finally figure out how effective the current pay system is. I will not go into detail now, but I think you will cover this in our discussion today. Some things, well, are just surprising. As soon as we equated nurses to the middle-level staff in terms of salary growth rates, they began to demote them to janitorial staff. Why? Their salary is not that high to begin with. What are you trying to save?
As much as 150 billion rubles in additional funds – 50 billion a year – were set aside to finance the modernisation of primary care over three years starting in 2020. This amount is so far believed to be sufficient for the initial phase of modernisation in the second half of 2020. I believe the amount of funding can be adjusted following an expert analysis of regional programmes.
The Government came up with its own approaches to distributing funds by region. This is a fairly complicated matter involving budget-to-budget transfers and we need to sit down and discuss it. Colleagues, I am here to listen to your proposals. Most importantly, we must see specific and visible results from the allocated appropriations.
There are many issues on our agenda. You looked into them carefully during the roundtable discussions and had the opportunity to exchange views.
Now, what matters is to reach mutually agreed upon decisions. Primary care is the foundation of the entire healthcare system. The word “primary” implies priority, not some obscure spot on the periphery of the healthcare system. In order to take primary care to the high level it deserves, the authorities at all levels must act in a coordinated manner and efficiently.
To reiterate, the regions must do the bulk of the work. I want the Government, the Ministry of Healthcare and other departments to provide comprehensive assistance and support to the regions.
Let us get to work.

Meeting with Governor of Kaliningrad Region Anton Alikhanov.
The Governor reported that last year the population of Kaliningrad Region exceeded one million; in particular, this year the region has seen a migration gain of almost 9,000 people over eight months, which is 30 percent higher than last year. Additional measures are in effect to boost the birth rate. At least one school is built every year, and 20 kindergartens will be added in 2019–2021.
The general financing of the regional healthcare system grew from 12.2 billion rubles in 2017 to 20.2 billion this year. In 2016, the region spent a little more than 350 million rubles on medicines, compared with 825 million this year and the expected sum of one billion rubles next year. A cancer centre is under construction in line with the President’s instructions. Mr Alikhanov also described how the region was overcoming the shortage of medical personnel.
Vladimir Putin and Anton Alikhanov also discussed the implementation of the President’s other instructions. The construction of the Northern Bypass around Kaliningrad is nearing completion. The design documentation is being updated in order to continue the construction of the Primorye Ring Road, of which the Northern Bypass is part.
