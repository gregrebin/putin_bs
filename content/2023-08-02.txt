President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.
The ceremony for presenting state decorations at the Kremlin signifies enormous respect for the outstanding citizens of Russia who personally made a colossal contribution to this country’s development, making service to the Motherland their top priority in life. You proved that you can achieve a lot with your aspirations and creative work, your response to what is happening in the world and in Russia, with your talent, amazing achievements for the common good, and loyalty to civic duty and the military oath.
Such professional and moral heights come to brave, strong and generous people who are especially sensitive to the times we live in and understand the core meaning of their work, calling and their entire lives; to those who always act with honesty, determination and integrity.
The Golden Stars of the Hero of Russia and the Orders of Courage will be presented today to a large group of participants in the special military operation.
Friends, thank you for your dedicated service to Russia. You came to the frontline with one common goal, to support your Fatherland and your nation at a difficult time, to protect our ideals, culture, national interests and defend people’s sacred right to live according to their will, to live their own lives as their ancestors taught them and to continue their glorious traditions that stem from their readiness to do anything for the sake of their beloved country.
It is exactly what Colonel Denis Ivanov, commander of a motorised rifle brigade, and Captain Roman Vorobyov, commander of an assault group, did. They fought in different sectors of the special military operation, carrying out their orders with honour and courage, boosting the morale of their fellow fighters with their own example. They died but they died heroes who showed no weakness or retreat. Their names will always remain in the glorious military history of our country.
Orders and medals will be presented to officers of the Russian National Guard and the Interior Ministry who selflessly defended Russia’s constitutional order on June 24. Every one of them showed courage and did everything to fulfil their duty as officers and citizens.
Friends,
Today, the Kremlin is bringing together representatives of various occupations: military personnel, doctors, writers, builders, metallurgists, cultural figures. All of you have deserved recognition through your work and talent.
Dedication, readiness to solve the most complicated tasks are the inalienable qualities of each of our cosmonauts. Anton Shkaplerov, who was awarded the second Order of Gagarin in the history of Russia, performed four space expeditions, including as a crew commander. He spent a total of more than 700 days on the ISS, including joint work with the crew of the Challenge film. Mr Shkaplerov does a lot to inspire young people, schoolchildren and students with the ideas of space exploration, because this is the guarantee of the continuity of our country's leading positions in the space industry.
Writer, scientist and public figure Brontoi Bedyurov makes a great contribution to the development of Russian literature. His book “The Tale of Altai” contains a wealth of historical and folklore material, and most importantly, is filled with love for his native land, for his people. The guardian of the cultural and spiritual traditions of Altai, Mr Bedyurov, has always defended the unity of Russia – our common great Motherland.
Philanthropist, charity worker and public figure Aimani Kadyrova devoted her whole life to serving people. For almost 20 years, Ms Kadyrova has headed the Hero of Russia Akhmat Kadyrov Foundation. Over these years, hundreds of thousands of people have received help and support.
I am glad to welcome academician David Ioseliani. He was the first in our country to do coronary stenting. Largely due to his efforts, this important area of national healthcare is developing successfully. A brilliant and innovative surgeon who has performed thousands of invasive heart surgeries, he often calls himself an old fashioned doctor, a reference to his utmost attention to every patient. Mr Ioseliani is sure that such a cordial attitude towards people is the key to their treatment and recovery, and it is hard to disagree with this.
Responsiveness and goodwill distinguish Valery Batin. For almost 40 years he has been working at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, constantly improving his skills and mastering the latest equipment. He enjoys great respect among his colleagues and for young workers, who are only mastering their profession, he is both an example and a true helper.
Friends,
Your achievements are the strength, pride and honour of Russia. Thank you for your work, for your dedication and loyalty to the Fatherland. I wish you many new successes.
Let's start the ceremony.

Vladimir Putin: Friends,
I want to congratulate all of you again on the decorations and, as today’s ceremony draws to a close, there is something I would like to say.
Speaking here, a woman who was decorated earlier today – she is a doctor – said that Russia, of course, needed to be loved, defended, protected and taken care of. This is really so. That is why first I want to thank the servicemen who are present here and who today received orders and medals they deserve.
I also want to address the families of our comrades who will never receive high state decorations personally. I want all my colleagues across the country, at different levels of authority, to hear me speaking from this grand hall in the Kremlin: these are our families, and their children are our children. This is precisely how we should treat them – not because someone has laid this down as a rule somewhere or ordered this, but because we are answering the call of the heart.
I want to wish the servicemen present here good health and to serve our Fatherland the way they have been doing up until now. I want to wish you and your comrades-in-arms every success.
I also want to thank those representing different professions, including culture, literature and the industrial sector, for everything you are doing for Russia. Each one of you in your place is making a contribution that makes our Russia strong, forward-looking and capable of facing the future with confidence, and this gives us the right to believe that this is how it will be. People like you will ensure this steady progress.
Thank you and best wishes to you.
