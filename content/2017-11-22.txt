Meeting with Defence Ministry and defence industry senior officials and heads of ministries and regions.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
I propose that we discuss a key event on our training schedule, the Zapad-2017 strategic military exercise, primarily its civilian aspects as the exercise involved many civilian departments and regions.
Attending this meeting are the heads of ministries and the governors who contributed to the organisation of this exercise. I would like them to speak about their conclusions and proposals regarding the issues that occurred and the aspects that still need to be addressed.
It should be said that several important goals have been attained at the exercise. First, we checked our mobilisation readiness and ability to use local resources to meet the troops’ requirements. Reservists were called up for this exercise, and we also tested the ability of civilian companies to transfer their vehicles and equipment to the armed forces and provide technical protection to transport communications.
We also assessed the provision of transport and logistics services, as well as foods and medicines to the army. We need to review once again the defence companies’ ability to quickly increase output.
The exercise has exposed certain shortcomings. We must analyse them so as to propose additional measures to enhance mobilisation readiness.
I want to say that the economic ability to increase the production of defence products and services quickly is a vital element of military security. All strategic and simply large companies, regardless of the type of ownership, must be able to do this.
We held detailed discussions on this topic in 2015 and 2016. Instructions were issued to modernise production, to create a reserve of material and technical resources, and to ensure the transportation of military personnel. The ministries and agencies are working on this in close cooperation with the Defence Ministry under the guidance of the Board of the Military Industrial Commission. I would like you to make short reports on this work at our meeting today and to say which shortcomings of the past few years have been settled and which are still to be dealt with.
Let us talk about all of this in detail and draw conclusions for the future.

Meeting with President of Iran Hassan Rouhani.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I would like to thank you again for making the decision to come to Sochi today. I remember how warmly you received me in Tehran recently. In this regard, please convey my best wishes to the religious leader of Iran, Mr Khamenei.
We cooperate with you in almost all areas of mutual interest. We now have the opportunity to discuss the entire range of our relations.
Once again, of course, I want to note our undeniable progress toward resolving the situation in Syria.
Thank you.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani
(retranslated): Mr President, I am pleased to be in Sochi and to be part of the very useful and timely meeting, which we had here.
I am very grateful for your hospitality and consider this meeting very important for the peace and stability of Syria. I expect that the Syrian National Congress will meet here in Sochi in the near future. This meeting is an important step on our way to making it happen. We will have done something major if we can stop the bloodshed even for an hour and bring peace back to the Syrian land.
I am pleased that, in recent years, the relations between our countries have been good and positive like never before. Our cooperation has been positive not only at the bilateral level, but also regionally and internationally.
Stronger cooperation between us is in the interests of our two nations, the interests of the region and is not directed against third countries. I hope that, in the future, we will be able to take important steps to strengthen our cooperation at the bilateral level, regionally and internationally.
Thank you very much.
