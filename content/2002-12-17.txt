The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin:
Esteemed Mr President, esteemed colleagues and friends. Let me once again cordially welcome you to the Kremlin. Russia regards Yemen as a reliable partner, with whom we are united by very many things. It is, first and foremost, our mutual interest in shaping a world order on a multipolar democratic basis, and the ensuring of durable international security.
We just now talked at considerable length with Mr. President about the problems of the Middle Eastern settlement and about the situation around Iraq. We talked about the necessity to increase our cooperation in fighting terrorism. But I think it will be more correct if we pay much attention in the course of your visit, Esteemed Mr President, also to cooperation on a bilateral basis, to economic cooperation, military technological and other forms of our collaboration.
