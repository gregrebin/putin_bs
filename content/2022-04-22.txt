President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today we will discuss cooperation with our closest neighbours in the post-Soviet space. Mr Overchuk is in charge of this matter in the Government. He has extensive knowledge of this work, especially the economic track. I would like to invite him to report first and then we will discuss today’s agenda.
