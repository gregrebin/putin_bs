Remarks at Meeting with Command of 201st Motorized Infantry Division Stationed in Tajikistan
April 27, 2003

Dushanbe
President Putin: I am very glad to be able to meet you, to have a talk, to discuss the situation which is evolving in the division. You know that the situation in Central Asia as a whole is stable, but remains sufficiently complicated taking Afghanistan into account. I think that you well know what is happening there. It is still very far to full pacification and to complete stabilization there. Recently, moreover, our special services, including that of the Defense Ministry, have registered a considerably increased activity and the restoration of Taliban structures, of Al-Qaeda structures and so on. In this connection efforts by the international coalition in the fight against the terrorist threat must be improved and built up. The factor of the 201st Division in Tajikistan, in this region is a factor of stability for Tajikistan itself, which is our strategic partner; for the region as a whole the 201st Division is likewise a very positive factor.
We plan the further strengthening of our presence here. Yesterday the President of Tajikistan, Emmomali Rakhmonov, and I quite thoroughly discussed this theme. He supports these plans. Moreover, we agreed to enhance joint work on bringing to the required quality our preliminary agreements on the formation here of a Russian military base.

Speech at a Meeting of the EurAsEC Interstate Council
April 27, 2003
00:01
Dushanbe
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
First of all, we must all thank the Chairman of the EurAsEC Interstate Council, Nursultan Nazarbayev, for his profound and substantive report and for the sustained work he has been conducting all this time as chairman. By the way, jumping ahead a little bit, I think it would be right if we asked him to remain chairman for another year, in spite of his reluctance. We have already discussed this in a narrow circle, and we all agree that many positive initiatives have come from Kazakhstan. There are other integration processes underway and all this needs to be coordinated with what is happening within the EurAsEC. The President of Kazakhstan is immersed in all these problems and he is best equipped to handle all these issues. There will be no deterioration in the quality of work. But on the whole, the report deserves support.
There is one other issue which has been pointed out by Alexander Lukashenko: the speeding of integration processes connected with particularly sensitive areas, such as non-tariff restrictions on trade. It was the Russian delegation that has suggested postponing the final decisions on these issues until September. If the Chairman does not object I would like to propose that the head of our delegation’s experts, Deputy Prime Minister Khristenko, briefly comment on the Russia’s position.
In our opinion, non-tariff regulation measures and restrictions is a reaction to the disharmonies of our legislations in the customs and economic spheres. It is a response to the economic realities and is designed to eliminate these discrepancies. We believe that the introduction of these restrictive measures will encourage the governments to harmonize legislations.
On the whole I agree with our colleagues, with the Chairman and with the President of Belarus that delays cannot be tolerated. We have asked that experts be given some time to finalize the documents, but I urge all the experts to work actively not only to remove these restrictions, but mainly to remove the causes that prompt these restrictions. Legislations must be harmonized, and common customs and other economic regulators must be introduced.
In planning for the future it is important to analyze how earlier agreements have worked in practice, how effectively the production and scientific potential of the EurAsEC members is being used, and how the currency and financial, customs and transport agreements work.
Obviously, many aspects of the EurAsEC activities still don’t have a solid enough foundation. There is not enough experience. But we must assess objectively the results of our joint efforts if we want to take optimal decisions and make the necessary adjustments. I expect that our work today will serve the process of integration.
Thank you.

Statement to the Press Following Interstate Council Meeting of the Eurasian Economic Community
April 27, 2003
00:03
Dushanbe
Vladimir Putin: The Russian delegation is pleased with the results of the work of the Interstate Council of the Eurasian Economic Community. A number of decisions have been made today opening new prospects for the development of our many-sided cooperation.
In the first place, I want to agree with the President of Belarus: we also welcome the coming of Armenia as observer to the Eurasian Economic Community, and we welcome the participation in the Interstate Council meeting of Armenian President Robert Sedrakovich Kocharian. In the future we count on positive work with the Armenian partners.
There were adopted, as has already been said, the 2003–2006 priority lines of Community development. This program is designed to provide guidelines for our near-term work. A great role in its preparation was played by the initiatives advanced in the report of the Chairman of the Interstate Council, Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev, which were called ”On the State of Affairs in the Eurasian Economic Community and Proposals for Speeding up Integration Cooperation.“
We thoroughly discussed the forms of coordination among our countries in the course of entry into the WTO. We are convinced that we shall be able to ensure the entry of our countries into the WTO on worthy terms, optimal for our economies and national producers. This we shall be able to do if we act in a coordinated manner.
Decisions were also taken strengthening the legal base of the mechanisms of multilateral cooperation.
In particular, we approved the status of the Court of the Eurasian Economic Community. This is one more step towards the creation of a civilized environment for trade-and-economic cooperation, the interregional collaborative effort and the businesslike partnership as a whole.
We spoke today also of the utilization of the Community's potential for solving the questions of power supply. This problem is particularly relevant to the Central Asian member countries of the Eurasian Economic Community. I reckon that the establishment of a stable energy infrastructure will become one of the decisive factors of onward economic progress.
In conclusion, I want to once again express satisfaction with the results of today's summit. I believe that it has been possible to create an additional basis for the development of many-sided integration in the interests of our countries and peoples.
I would like to sincerely thank our hosts, the President of Tajikistan, for the excellent conditions provided for our work. We know that Tajikistan had been preparing for this event, had worked purposefully, and we see the results. We are grateful and confident that Tajikistan will yet be repeatedly able to use the infrastructure which was created for the organization of our work.
Thank you very much indeed.
