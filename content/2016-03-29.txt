The enterprise manufactures S-400, S-500 and Vityaz air defence missile systems, and Nebo-M and Nioby radar complexes. The plant carries out the final assembly, adjustment and testing of the products. Testing stands in the plant's workshops allow for testing hardware on the spot, without sending it to proving grounds. Construction of the plant, which is part of the Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Corporation, was launched in 2011. By the end of 2015, its shops were outfitted with cutting-edge equipment, including Russian-made machinery. The President also inspected models of a missile plant in Kirov and of the Northwestern Regional Centre of the Almaz-Antey Corporation.
Beginning of meeting with employees of the Nizhny Novgorod 70th Anniversary of Victory Plant
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. I would like to congratulate you on this significant event in your lives, the life of your team and the life of the Russian defence industry. One of our leading defence industry complexes acquired a new enterprise in addition to another two – in Kirov and St Petersburg. It would be no exaggeration to say that they are making us proud of the Russian machine industry.
Why do I say Russian machine industry? Because in building these plants we were restoring and have restored our competence in building engineering plants in general.
It goes without saying that the “stuffing” is beyond praise. We talked with the guys and it is probably difficult to work with such equipment but it raises one’s competence.
Incidentally, when we decided where to build these plants, there were different proposals based on the idea of locating industrial capacities evenly throughout the country’s territory. But eventually we decided to build them here, in Nizhny Novgorod, because it already had a plant of this kind that manufactured essentially the same products, but of the previous generation. We assumed that the level of competence and training of workers and engineers – all of those involved in this sphere will help us reach a completely new stage in the production of this equipment.
The Russian Army needs this hardware to enhance our defence capability and ensure Russia’s security. This is understandable as these are air defence and radar systems operating in this complex. But there is more to it, as it transpired.
You know this yourselves but let me say it in case someone does not know. This was done also because our plants no longer coped with their orders, including exports. It became clear that our enterprises cannot meet the requirements of our contracts, including exports because these products are very popular owing to their reliability and efficiency.
Let me congratulate you again and wish you success.
