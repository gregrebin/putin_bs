The initiative to build the monument came from Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
during his visit to Moscow in February 2010, and received the Russian leadership’s support. The monument was designed by Russian architects and sculptors and was built in Netanya’s central district, alongside an existing monument to the fallen in the Israeli-Arab wars.

Speech at a ceremony of unveiling a monument marking the Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Everything I just seen and heard here makes a strong emotional impact on me and strengthens my deep respect for the Jewish people, for Israel’s people, and my sense of gratitude for everything you are doing to immortalise the memory of those who died in World War II.
We are here to unveil a monument that I think will become one of the most symbolic in the country. I have seen various monuments in Israel, all of them works of talent that make a truly deep impression. But this monument commemorates the immortal heroism and strength of spirit of the entire wartime generation, their countless sacrifices and irreplaceable losses, and the victory in 1945 that has given the whole of humanity an undying legacy. 
Russia holds sacred the memory of this terrible war. We greatly appreciate that our sincere feelings are shared here in Israel, where millions of people in their hearts, just like in Russia, keep a special place for dates such as September 1, 1939, June 22, 1941, and May 9, 1945.
As we unveil this monument today, we grieve together for those who fell on the battlefields, died from wounds and hunger, or suffered the death camps’ tortures. The Holocaust was one of the blackest, most shameful and tragic pages in all of human history. Even today, our hearts still refuse to accept this monstrous cruelty that the Nazis committed. It was the Soviet Army that put an end to this madness and saved from destruction not just the Jewish people but many other peoples too. And now, this wonderful monument has been raised in its honour here in this holy land.
This monument appeals to our memory, but also reminds us of just how fragile peace is. We must do everything we possibly can to ensure that the criminal Nazi doctrines never rise again under any form or guise, and that the Nuremberg Tribunal’s verdicts remain unquestioned. 
It is our duty to defend and preserve the truth about the war and prevent any attempts to justify the Nazis’ helpers. We cannot and will never allow the executioners and their victims to be placed together, and will not accept the truth to be distorted and replaced by all manner of falsifications and fabrications. To rewrite history in this way would be a crime before the memory of those millions of people who gave their lives for victory, and a crime before the future generations, who must know the true heroes of World War II and be able to distinguish the truth from insolent and cynical lies. This is why the monument we are unveiling today is so important.
Once more, I want to thank sincerely for this initiative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and express my profound gratitude too, to President of Israel Shimon Peres and all of our Israeli friends for their all-round effort to preserve history’s memory. Of course, I also want to thank the monument’s creators – the team of Russian sculptors and architects – Salavat Shcherbakov, Vasily Perfilyev, and Mikhail Naroditsky.
The white dove soaring skywards, the dove’s wings, symbolise the victory of goodness and peace. May these eternal values always remain the solid foundation of the friendship between our countries and their peoples.

President of Israel Shimon Peres
(retranslated): Mr President, members of the delegation,
I do not know how you have this much energy. The amount of work you did today is truly superhuman. I will speak very briefly and say just a few words, so as not to overtire you.
I am very glad to welcome you here, to the residence of the President of Israel. The world is transforming from its old form to a newer version, so we cannot allow this transitional period to somehow put our future in question. Your visit has great significance for all the citizens of Israel since we see you as a leader whose input is very important and significant in the development of the entire world.
Russia and Israel share a common history. Your people took in ours when we were dispersed, and our people feel a deep gratitude to your people for saving us from the hands of Hitler’s executioners, gratitude toward the Soviet Army which was the first to liberate the concentration camps and put an end to those horrors.
I am certain that under your leadership, Russia will play a very important role in light of the challenges and threats affecting the world today. I know, Mr President, that Russia does not agree with Iran having a nuclear arsenal; you stated this quite clearly. And it is very important that Iran’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons be cut off. Nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran are a threat to Iran’s neighbours and the entire world.
And now, I would like to address you with a personal issue. Iran’s current leadership openly states its intention to erase Israel from the face of the earth. We cannot permit or allow nuclear arms ending up in the hands of a regime that openly threatens to annihilate us. I turn to you personally on this matter, because you know how seminal the current situation is for us. We are certain that your voice on the subject will be heard.
Russia has shown initiative and on your initiative hosted the latest round of talks on the issue of Iran in Moscow. Russia has worked to maintain the unity of the international community even in spite of disagreements.
In parallel with our uncompromising war against terror, Israel holds out a hand of peace. For us, peace is an important moral value, and at the same time, a strategic value. Russia participated in designing and elaborating a solution to this conflict within the framework of the Quartet. Certainly, an overwhelming majority of the people in Israel are in favour of the two-state solution. Both sides must renew talks and turn the political agreement into reality.
Russia can play a very important role in this process. You personally, Mr President, can also play a role in this process. We are grateful to you for your efforts to finally bring about a new, peaceful reality in the Middle East.
(In Russian) Thank you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, first of all, thank you very much for your invitation.
I would like to also thank you for today’s ceremony, for the opening of the monument in memory of the Soviet soldiers who died during World War II.
We fought Nazism together – I want to emphasise that we really fought together. This means that we have common humanitarian values – this is the sturdiest foundation for cooperation.
Israel is in a special region of the world – the well-being of the entire international community depends largely on its well-being.
This is not the first time we are meeting and I remember all our previous conversations. You are certainly a part of the highly respected generation of absolutely world-class, global-level politicians.
You are right, the situation in the world and in the region changes very quickly so in these changing circumstances, we must find ways for all the nations of the region, and the world overall, to cooperate, which will allow everyone to live in peace and tranquility, create conditions that will encourage development.
Indeed, there are over a million, almost a million and a half emigrants from the former Soviet Union residing in Israel. And it is no accident that we have a visa-free regime: there is mutual interest in such visa-free travel. It means that people are drawn to one another – they are drawn to their roots.
You said that Russia once provided the opportunity for a part of the Jewish people to live in our country. We do not quite see it that way and believe they are a part of our own people. I want to tell you that these doors are open in both directions: I do not think it is out of the question that, perhaps, some people will return to our country, and in fact some are already coming back. This means that the world has become more fluid, more mobile and all of its components are very much interdependent.
It is in Russia’s national interests to secure peace and order in the Middle East, peace and order for the people of Israel. It is no accident that the Soviet Union was among the initiators and supporters of the creation of the state of Israel.
I want to say that we had very fruitful and comprehensive talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu. We not only closed the books of what has been done lately but also discussed the need to broaden our cooperation in the near future and strategically. That is exactly what we intend to do.
I want to thank you, Mr President, for supporting policies aimed at broadening relations with Russia. I want to say (and I already told you this before) that in the fall of this year, we are planning to open a museum in Moscow called the Museum of Tolerance, but it will be largely devoted to the issues of the Holocaust.
And I once again sincerely invite you to its opening.

made press statements following the talks.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
First of all, I want to thank Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and our Israeli colleagues for their hospitality and for this invitation.
This visit to Israel has once again reaffirmed for me that the strong ties of friendship binding our countries and peoples are not just words, but are a real and solid foundation upon which we are building fruitful political dialogue, a multifaceted partnership, successful bilateral cooperation and work together to help resolve the biggest issues facing the world.
We discussed in detail the full range of our bilateral relations today, giving particular attention to economic issues. I note that the active reciprocal efforts made by our government agencies and business communities have been successful in overcoming the temporary drop in our bilateral trade. Our trade increased by 10 percent last year and came to almost $3 billion – higher than the pre-crisis figures.
We and our Israeli colleagues intend to continue developing our economic ties, above all through big joint projects, including in important sectors such as the energy sector. Gazprom has good opportunities in this respect, and there are also good opportunities in the electricity sector, with our company INTER RAO UES and others.
There are good prospects for latest initiatives in the agribusiness sector. This is an area with strong potential for both countries. We are already carrying out projects to build livestock farming centres in Tambov Region and Stavropol Territory, and also an animal feed production plant in Rostov Region. 
We have concrete results in the hi-tech sectors. RUSNANO, for example, has opened a subsidiary company in Israel and is working with its Israeli partners now to select promising projects. An Israeli company opened in Vladimir Russia’s first facility for manufacturing circuit boards for electronic devices using Israeli technology.
We have agreed to expand our cooperation in space exploration. Russian rockets will carry Israeli spacecraft into orbit, and our specialists are developing satellite communications systems for our Israeli partners. 
There is a bright future for cooperation in medicine and pharmaceuticals. I am not merely talking about imports of medicines and equipment from Israel, but also projects to establish modern pharmaceuticals production facilities.
We are actively developing our cultural and humanitarian contacts. The Russian Science and Culture Centre in Tel Aviv has been working for five years now. 
I want to thank once more our Israeli friends for helping us to restore Russia’s historic rights to the Sergiyev Pilgrims’ Guesthouse. The agreement on visa-free travel for our citizens has also done much to develop scientific and business ties and contacts between our peoples.
During our talks we discussed subjects that are sensitive matters for both countries, for example, the problem of biased and often cynical interpretations of the history of World War II. It is our common duty to prevent attempts to falsify the truth about the war and its lessons. We value Israel’s objective attitude towards the events of World War II. People here do not dispute the decisive role the Soviet Union played in defeating Nazism. The people that lived through the Holocaust cannot forget their executioners, or their liberators. 
In this respect the unveiling of a monument paying tribute to the Red Army here in Israel is symbolic. I want to thank once more our Israeli friends for making this possible, and thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his initiative.
Naturally, we also discussed the situation in the Middle East today. Israel is home to around 1 million, if not more, of our former compatriots, and we want to see them live in peace and security.
I remind you that, right from the start of the Arab Spring, Russia consistently told its partners that democratic transformation must take place in civilised fashion and without outside interference. The events in the Middle East only make it more urgent than ever to resolve the region’s long-running conflicts, especially the Arab-Israeli conflict. We call on all sides to resume negotiations. This is the only way towards reaching a settlement. 
Of course, we also spoke in detail about the situation in Syria and the Iranian nuclear programme.
In conclusion, I want to say once more that our talks were substantive and very useful. I am sure that our mutually advantageous cooperation will continue its active development. This is fully in the interests of our peoples and in the interest of regional and global stability.
Thank you very much for your attention.
