The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Li Zhanshu, friends, let me welcome in Moscow.
I know that you and your Russian counterpart Mr Vaino
have discussed the current state of our bilateral relations and upcoming contacts between various agencies and at the highest level.
Our next contact will be with President Xi Jinping
in Beijing on May 14–15, at the international conference the Chinese government is holding to promote the development of economic cooperation in the region and the world.
We supported these plans from the start, all the more so as they match our own plans to develop cooperation and integration processes in the post-Soviet space.
I think that this joint work will give added support to the unprecedentedly high level of bilateral relations our countries have developed over these past years. I would like to ask you to pass on my very best wishes to President Xi.
Director of the General Office of the Communist Party of China Li Zhanshu (retranslated): Mr President,
As Director of the General Office of the Communist Party of China, I know well what it means to work day and night for China’s interests. I think the same goes for you. Today, therefore, I express my great gratitude to you for finding the time to meet me, despite your busy schedule, and I pass on the best wishes from your good friend President Xi Jinping. He is ready to meet with you in mid-May in Beijing.
Thanks to the initiatives and guidance coming from President Xi Jinping and Your Excellency, Chinese-Russian relations of strategic partnership and cooperation have taken on a mature, lasting nature. Our relations have reached a very high level today.
Before my departure, I went especially to see President Xi Jinping and asked him what he wanted to pass on to you. He told me to say that today, Chinese-Russian relations are going through their best period ever in our history.
Today, our relations are deservedly called an example of relations between great powers, characterised by cooperation and mutual benefit. Today, our relations are very solid, mature, and are distinguished by strategic cooperation and a lasting nature.
He also said that despite the serious changes in the international situation, we will continue to work with you unfailingly adhering to three constants, namely: regardless of the circumstances, we will not change our policy of deepening and developing our strategic partnership and cooperation; our policy, based on joint development and prosperity, will not change; and our joint efforts to defend peace and justice and promote cooperation in the world will not change. These were the words of President Xi Jinping.

Meeting with Minister of Labour and Social Protection Maxim Topilin
Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Minister of Labour and Social Protection Maxim Topilin.

Meeting with Minister of Labour and Social Protection Maxim Topilin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Topilin, I would like to discuss with you not only current social policy issues but also the upcoming trends that we will definitely encounter due to a number of objective circumstances.
We are certainly happy with the natural population growth. We have achieved this as a result of persistent efforts to stimulate and support births, motherhood and childhood. Life expectancy is growing even faster than we expected and planned. These are, without a doubt, the results of our combined efforts.
At the same time, we know about the problems that lie in store for us and that date back to the 1990s, when the country experienced a massive, if not disastrous, decrease in the number of births.
As a result, in the very near future (experts know this very well) the number of women of reproductive age will decline, and by 2025, according to experts, their numbers will fall by 34 percent compared to 2015.
However, there is no getting away from that, because this is what we inherited from the not so distant past, from the 1990s. In this connection, the structure of our population will be changing as well. The burden on the working-age population will increase. The number of elderly people will grow while the number of births, due to objective circumstances, will evidently decline.
Needless to say, we should and we will attempt to stimulate births and will continue the policy of supporting motherhood and childhood but we need to adjust social policy as a whole. This is what I would like to discuss with you and I propose we start with this.
Minister of Labour and Social Protection Maxim Topilin
: Mr President,
Yes, the birth rate fell in the 1990s, compared to the significant increase in the birth rate 2 generations after the Great Patriotic War. There was an upsurge in the birth rate after the Great Patriotic War, when people returned from war and started families.
Vladimir Putin: This is a post-crisis phenomenon.
MaximTopilin: There was a substantial increase in the 1970s and 1980s as well. In the 1990s, the picture changed dramatically for understandable reasons, and the ‘war waves’ had their impact. In other words, the demographic situation has always depended here on various crises or conflict situations, and Russia was hit repeatedly by such waves during the twentieth century. In the 1990s, practically every year – in 1991, 1992, and in 1998–1999 – we lost practically 150,000–200,000 births every year.
Vladimir Putin: Population decrease was close to 1 million a year.
MaximTopilin: By 2006, when you set the task of drafting the new demographic project, and when the executive order on developing demographic processes was signed, we had natural population loss of around 650,000–700,000 a year.
The demographic measures that we adopted in 2006 and then in 2010 and 2012 have without question made the main contribution to producing the situation we see today. I remember that no one believed that the childbirth capital programme would produce results; no one believed that these financial incentives would work. Everyone thought this was impossible.
The objective economic picture and growing incomes all went together. The measures we took did produce results, results that, as you have said, no one expected, because the overall birth ratio, the number of children per woman of reproductive age, had fallen as low as 1.1, and when we began the demographic programme it was 1.3.
Vladimir Putin: It is 1.76 now.
MaximTopilin: 1.76, 1.75 – Rosstat [National Statistics Agency] is updating the figures. We have reached the goal we set ourselves.
I would like to reiterate that according to experts, it is extremely important that measures to stimulate births are constantly expanding. Thus, in 2006–2007, there was maternity capital and a significant growth in benefits.
At that time, we first introduced benefits for nonworking, uninsured women. That produced an upsurge. If we look at the charts, there is a surge in the number of births and the aggregate birth rate.
In 2010–2011, land programmes were launched. They are working better in some places and worse in others, but overall that also produced a certain increment. In 2013, allowances for third-born children were introduced, that was when we put forth the goal of providing incentives for the birth of a third, rather than second child.
Federation regions receive about 15–16 billion rubles a year to make these payments. They are regional [payments] and ensure a subsistence level for a child. At present, this is 10,000 [rubles a month]. It is an impressive level, significant support for the family.
We have always sought, in keeping with your directives, to use such purely demographic measures as maternity capital to support families’ current incomes, because this is also very important.
For three years, there was natural growth, not very large but a natural growth compared to the minus 600,000 in 2006 that I mentioned earlier. At present, we are considering and analysing this situation with experts. Indeed, it was predictable.
Today women in the 20–39 age bracket – the core childbearing category – number a little more than 22 million. That number will steadily fall until 2035, when there will be about 15–16 million. This figure basically should not change because all of them have already been born and are children now.
Vladimir Putin: 7.1 [million].between 20 and 29.
Maxim Topilin: Between 20 and 39.
Vladimir Putin: And between 20 and 29, it is 7.1 million.
Maxim Topilin: Yes. Today we need to continue what we started, proceeding from what I said, proceeding from the fact that we believe that demographic measures to stimulate births are working.
Secondly, these measures require constant adjustment, constant expansion, given the rather serious decline in the number of reproductive-age women. We need to work out additional measures to stem this trend.
I believe we have everything that is needed at the very least to prevent a significant drop in the number of births so as to neutralise these negative trends as much as possible.

Meeting with President of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Juan Manuel Vega-Serrano.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, it is a great pleasure to meet with you.
This is the first time your organisation is holding such a big event in Moscow, an event that aims to implement the principles of the work to combat money laundering, coordinating the efforts of FATF and those of this Asian cluster (the Eurasian group on combating money laundering and financing of terrorism (EAG), which was established at Russia’s initiative and has been operating with considerable success.
I am pleased to see that under your presidency, FATF is firmly intent on actively combating financial terrorism in the world. This is a crucial area of work.
It goes without saying that we will do everything possible to facilitate efforts to reach the goals you have set.
President of FATF Juan Manuel Vega-Serrano (retranslated): Good afternoon, Mr President. Thank you very much for the invitation. It is a great pleasure to be here in the Russian Federation.
Thank you for receiving me today. I think that this meeting is evidence of Russia’s commitment at the very highest level to fighting money laundering and financing of terrorism. This is definitely very important.
It is also a pleasure to see Mr Chikhanchin
, the head of Russia’s financial monitoring service. He is a valuable professional and we appreciate him highly in our organisation, in FATF.

Meeting with Head of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov
Vladimir Putin met with Head of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov.

Meeting with Head of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Minnikhanov, Tatarstan has long been first in many categories. However, it has unresolved problems and faces formidable challenges, as everyone does. Let us discuss everything – the republic’s socioeconomic situation as a whole.
Head of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov: First, I would like to thank you on behalf of all the people of Tatarstan for the distinguished title that you have bestowed on our venerable Mintimer Shaimiev. He fully deserves this award, which is a precious gift to our republic. I believe we will continue to work on ambitious projects with the Russian Federation and do good for our country.
I would like to report briefly on last year and the first quarter of 2017. I have put together a report, but I will cite some figures right now. Industrial output increased by 3.6 percent in 2016, and gross regional product by 2.5 percent. Investments in fixed capital, rural issues and housing – things prioritised by the May Executive Orders – all these targets have been met.
As for the first quarter, industrial output increased by 4.7 percent and gross regional product by 4.2 percent. The economic situation is improving in principle, and we can address all the other issues.
I prepared the programmes that we are implementing: more than 30 programmes for all our cities and regions. I would like to say that on your instructions (your Address to the Federal Assembly makes special note of this) we have developed an ambitious two-year programme concerning primary healthcare. All outpatient clinics and other facilities – about 180 – will be repaired within these two years, most of them this year, and the rest next year.
One of our more complicated problems has to do with banks. It started this year. Several of our banks have gone bankrupt and some depositors lost money and are concerned.
A government commission has been set up and we are actively working with the Deposit Insurance Agency and the Central Bank, and creditors are being organised.
The culprits have been detained and law enforcement officials are analysing every transaction. We will certainly have to find a mechanism: we intend to establish a special fund to support depositors who will not be able to get compensation from sold-off assets, if these assets do not suffice. That is one category.
Equity holders make up another category. We are working with them as well. The managers of two major companies have also been detained in the case.
These are the two matters we are addressing. On the whole, we are implementing big projects and our programmes, and I can say in full confidence that this year will also be a success.
