Addresses at the presentation of International Olympic Committee members
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President Bach, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to sincerely welcome you all to Sochi and to thank the President of the International Olympic Committee, Mr Bach, all IOC members and all employees of this highly respected organisation for your invaluable support in the course of the preparations for the XXII Winter Olympic Games.
During all the years that we were implementing our Olympic project you were always close, helping us in word and in deed, and together we have achieved a great deal.
The Sochi Olympics will leave behind a truly great legacy. They have not only changed the image of the city, making it more beautiful and comfortable, but have also given an enormous boost to its social, economic, cultural and environmental development. I have just been telling some colleagues that the environment in the region has improved not by mere percentage points – it is two, three, and according to some parameters, four times better now. This is all the result of the work done here. I am referring to the quality of the roads, which means reduced emissions, transition to more environmentally friendly fuels (such as natural gas), and the creation of waste treatment facilities; the air is now three to four times cleaner, and even the water in the mountain rivers has changed for the better; there are no more burning landfills.
I am confident that the Games, which are to begin in two days, will become an important page in the history of cooperation between Russia and the IOC. We value the trust and friendly and fruitful dialogue we have developed from the start with the support of Mr Rogge, who is modestly standing back there among the other participants of this meeting and who has done so much to make it possible for Russia to host these Games, just as he has done a great deal for the organisation and preparation of Olympics all over the world. We are happy that you share our commitment to becoming a more active participant in shaping the international sports agenda and that you help us join in the efforts to develop sports around the world.
Today Russia has four representatives on the IOC. We regard this as a sign of special trust on the part of the International Olympic Committee.
I expect that our specialists’ extensive management experience and thorough knowledge of all aspects of the sports sphere will benefit both your reputable organisation and the entire Olympic and Paralympic movement.
 I would like to assure you that Russia is always open to new ideas, projects and events in sports; we are ready to support and implement all the creative initiatives of our big common Olympic family.
Once again, I express my sincere gratitude for your valuable help.
I hope your stay in Russia will leave you with warm and happy memories, while the upcoming Games will be rich in remarkable, exciting and memorable events.
Thank you, once again, ladies and gentlemen, for your cooperation.
Thank you.
International Olympic Committee President THOMAS BACH: Your Excellency, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin,
Thank you very much for granting us the great honour of being with you this evening. We are on the eve of the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games. We can see that you, Russia, and the Russians have delivered. You have set the stage for the best winter athletes of the world. You have delivered on all the pledges you and your team made seven years ago to the International Olympic Committee. And we would very much like to congratulate you and to thank you for this outstanding achievement.
At the same time, I would like to thank the people of Russia, the people of Sochi and the Krasnodar Region, and especially the many volunteers, for the warm welcome they offered to us in the traditional Russian hospitality.
Russia has always been a great winter sport nation with a long record of achievement. The legacy of the Sochi Games will help future generations add to that record, to that record of success, for many years to come. These Games – and you have mentioned it, Mr President – these Games will also help achieve the goal of transforming a whole region into a year-round destination for sports, conventions and recreation.
None of this would have been possible without your personal involvement. Thank you for your strong commitment to the success of these Olympic Winter Games.
Your passion for sport is evident. You are not just a keen observer of sport; you are, the people wrote to me here, an active participant. But, may I say, you are an athlete, and an inspiring role model for millions of people throughout this vast nation. With the Sochi Games, Russia is opening a new chapter in its long and glorious Olympic history that dates back from the founding of the modern Olympic movement in 1894. We all look forward and we wish you and us a joyous celebration of sport and Olympic values in the new Russia.
Thank you very much, Mr President.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, allow me once again to extend you a sincere welcome. Actually, I am not sure whether I should welcome you, or you should welcome me: I think Sochi is going to be your home too now, at least for the duration of the Olympic Games.
I would like to thank you for everything that you have done over the past years. We have said a lot about how much the city has changed, how the environment has improved, and about the conditions that were created for engaging in sports for both high-class athletes and the public at large. In addition, I would very much like the Sochi Games to become yet another step in the development of the Olympic movement.
I would like to thank you and the entire International Olympic Committee for all the joint work and for your constant support. I assure you that we are doing everything to turn Sochi into a hospitable home for all participants and spectators. Our main goal is to turn the Olympic Games in Sochi into a festival for all sports fans around the world.
Thank you.
President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach (translated from Russian): Thank you, Mr President, for the warm welcome in your country. We have been received here with your traditional hospitality. In Russia we truly feel at home.
I was very happy to see how in the past 7 years Russia and Sochi have prepared venues for the best athletes of the world who will compete in the Winter Olympics. I have already had the opportunity to talk to many athletes and they are all excited about the sports facilities and the Olympic villages. They feel quite comfortable here.
We are very impressed by the development of the city and the entire region, which used to be, if I may say so, a provincial resort area, while now it is an international sport and cultural centre, a congress centre.
For seven years, we have been maintaining very productive contacts between experts of the Organising Committee and our Coordination Commission. This cooperation has proved to be very productive and positive.
First of all, Mr Putin, I would like to express my gratitude to you personally for your constant interest in the Olympic Games, and in sports in general. I know you give great attention to the development of a new Russia, where the focus will be on education, including professional, and inculcating the values and spirit of sports in children and young people. We look forward to having wonderful Olympic Games in a new Russia.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, you have touched upon a very important subject. We spoke many times of the region’s development, of resolving all sorts of issues here. However, one of the most important tasks that we are working on here in Russia and you are working on as President of the International Olympic Committee is making a positive impact on young people by developing sports, taking young people and children off the streets, away from alcohol, drugs and tobacco.
Here the International Olympic Committee, along with some other international sports organisations, plays a truly outstanding role in resolving these tasks. I would like to assure you that we will do everything to support these efforts of the International Olympic Committee, you can always count on us.
Let me wish you success in this work. Meanwhile we will do our best to hold the Sochi Olympics at the highest possible level.
Thomas Bach: The preparatory work that we saw gives us every reason to say the Games will surely be held at the highest level. 
I am grateful to you for touching upon the topic of mass sports, since this will become the Olympics’ main legacy, so that children and young people can not only follow sports events on television, use certain sports related services or play, for instance, sports videogames, but also engage in sports. This is why I have no doubt that our good relations will continue after the Olympic Games as well, especially since Russia will be hosting other major sports events.
Vladimir Putin (in German): I express my sincere gratitude to you.
Thomas Bach: Thank you very much.
