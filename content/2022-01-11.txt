President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Once again, Happy New Year everybody! I wish you success and all the best in the new year.
Today we will discuss matters pertaining to work in the border regions of Russia. The agenda is extremely busy and includes security and infrastructure issues.
But we will start with socioeconomic issues. I would like to ask today’s guest speaker, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, to report. As a former Minister of Economic Development, he understands these affairs quite well. I asked him to prepare and now I am passing the floor to him.
Please.
