Meeting with President of Kyrgyzstan Sooronbay Jeenbekov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: MrPresident,
I am very happy to see you again and to talk about our bilateral issues on the sidelines of the CIS summit. I think we should thank our hosts. As you just said, they organised everything perfectly well, both for bilateral and multilateral meetings.
As for our bilateral relations, I would like to note that they are developing steadily. All plans discussed and adopted at our previous meetings are being implemented.
Today we have the opportunity to touch base and see how this work is being done.
President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sooronbay Jeenbekov
: Mr President,
I want to thank you for the opportunity to meet with you.
As you know, the Kyrgyz Republic has always strived to develop and strengthen our strategic partnership. We highly value the support of the Russian party, its comprehensive support of the republic and we value our relationship a great deal.
The Russian Federation plays the most important role in the Kyrgyzstani economy: it ranks first. We are glad that the trade volume is increasing every year.
Thank you very much for finding the time to meet with me.
Vladimir Putin: You are absolutely right, and I want to confirm that Russia ranks as Kyrgyzstan’s largest trading partner with 23 percent of the trade volume. Last year, the trade volume grew by 34 percent. I think it is a significant improvement.
We have the opportunity to discuss what is necessary to do to maintain this pace in the future and to preserve this positive trend.
Sooronbay Jeenbekov: Yes, I agree.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
First of all, I would like to thank the President of Tajikistan for our intra-CIS work today. You have managed to create a very pleasant and business-like atmosphere that has yielded good results of our joint work. Thank you very much for your hospitality.
As for our bilateral relations, they are developing successfully. In 2017, bilateral trade increased by about 5 percent and soared by another 35 percent since early 2018. This is a very good indicator, and, of course, we need to maintain this pace.
The inter-governmental commission is working effectively. It is headed by the Prime Minister of Tajikistan and by Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov
, who has substantial economic management leverage. I hope that this will also help expand our bilateral ties.
I am very glad to have this opportunity to exchange information regarding the development of our relations with you and to chart short-term measures.
Thank you.
