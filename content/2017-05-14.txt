With President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, I am very pleased to see you.
You have just recalled the meeting we had here in China several years ago, which took place during another international event.
You can listen to the translation…
President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman: No need to translate. We all understand some Russian dialect – perhaps, the dialect of central Russia.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, standard Russian language.
To begin with, I would like to say that we are aware of your stance on the Russia-Czech relations, Mr President. To a large extent thanks to you, these relations have been maintained at a high level and have further developed in the past years despite any complications.
I see our conversation today as preparation for your visit to Russia this November. Our agencies have already started preparing for this visit. For example, the Russian Culture Ministry and the Foreign Ministry are working on a large exhibition in Moscow, and we find this news very pleasing. I believe that the Russian public and art lovers will enjoy this exhibition.

In the economic sector, despite the previous years' recession, trade turnover growth of over 44 percent was observed in the beginning of this year. This is a good sign and a good trend we have to preserve.
Milos Zeman: The number of tourists is growing – this is very positive.
Vladimir Putin: This is connected to the gradual restoration of personal incomes, which shrank during the crisis in our country. Today, actual earnings of our citizens have started to gradually increase, and tourist activity is increasing as well.
So, I am very glad about our new meeting.
Milos Zeman: Thank you very much.
This meeting [Belt and Road international forum] is a meeting of extraordinary, outstanding politicians. You were not present after your speech, and soon after the Deputy Premier of China delivered his speech. He spoke for about half an hour. He actually said what the Chinese President had already spoken about, but he was speaking very loudly.
Vladimir Putin: Repetition is the mother of learning.
Milos Zeman: Mr President, I totally agree with you that we must focus on developing specific links. I would like to give several examples.
Let me introduce new Minister of Industry and Trade, Mr Havlicek. He is not to blame for what happened in the past, he has been in the office for only a month. After 2.5 years of work, an intergovernmental commission will meet, and we expect it to give new impetus to our cooperation. This is the first thing.
Second, we have proposed establishing a joint discussion forum, and I know that the Russian side wants a well-regarded man to be responsible for the Czech part of the commission. I am not fully sure that I am well regarded, but if I am, I am totally ready to do this.
As for the third point that you have mentioned – it's the exhibition of Prague Castle treasures.

President of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): I am very glad that you and I have held our first meeting this year. Once again, I cordially welcome you to the Belt and Road international cooperation forum.
As a Russian proverb goes, ”One swallow doesn't make a summer.“ We say, ”One tree is not a forest yet.“ Three years ago, I came out with the Belts and Roads initiative. All leaders of participating countries actively supported this idea and responded. Leveraging joint efforts, this cooperation, including efforts to link Belts and Roads with the 21st century Maritime Silk Road, has achieved initial success.
Our circle of friends is expanding – our common cause brings benefit to the peoples of all countries. Your participation in the forum and your speech at the opening ceremony gives a powerful signal about China and Russia's intention to jointly promote the creation of an open global economy and boost regional cooperation between countries. This has played an important role in holding the forum at a high level. The Chinese side highly appreciates this.
China and Russia are kind neighbours, good friends and stable partners. Since the beginning of the year, the China-Russia relations and cooperation have continued to develop at a high level, with a number of new results achieved.
During the first quarter, mutual trade stood at $18.1 billion, up 2.9–3 percent, which shows a powerful revival tendency.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Chinese-Russian peace and friendship and 60th anniversary of the Society for Chinese-Soviet Friendship. The sides are in the process of developing and implementing plans for holding various festive events.
We are successfully continuing the events marking the Year of Chinese Mass Media in Russia. This has allowed us to strengthen mutual understanding between our nations and has provided a strong public basis of China-Russia relations and a strategic partnership amid the difficult and ever-changing situation in the world. China and Russia have expressed responsibility as great powers.
The joint efforts in settling the political situation in Syria and the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula has played a stabilising role in providing peace and stability in the region and the world.
Developing and expanding our relations is our strategic choice. Whatever the international situation is, we must be strong and go forward shoulder to shoulder, steadily considering the development of our relations as a foreign policy priority. We must make every effort to properly advance our relations and achieve greater results in our cooperation.
Thank you for your attention.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
First of all, congratulations on the successful opening of the large international forum held at your initiative.
As I said in my address today, the timing for this forum is quite good considering the ongoing complicated developments in the world in general and in global economy in particular.
More than ever, we need new cooperation mechanisms in order to open doors to each other, eliminate barriers and obstacles in our cooperation – primarily, in the economy.
In my opinion, the main issue on our bilateral agenda is your upcoming visit to the Russian Federation and we very much look forward to it.
Our governments, the Russian Presidential Executive Office and the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, are currently drafting quite a set of documents, including an action plan toward fulfilling our strategic initiatives for the next few years.
A schedule of contacts has been developed at the level of the governments, ministries, agencies and parliaments of our countries. We are satisfied with the course of our relationship in all these directions.
As concerns the economy, which never leaves our attention, over the last year we have managed to overcome certain negative trends and have achieved a four-percent increase in trade turnover. During the first few months of this year, between January and March, the growth rate was already 37 percent.
What is particularly important and pleasing is that trade patterns are changing structurally. The share of machine engineering and agricultural products is growing for both countries.
However, there is still much room for improvement. Particularly, when it comes to complicated international issues where we always stand side by side and support each other in overcoming various problems. This is certainly a very important factor in international affairs, one that serves to stabilise the political situation.
Let me thank you once again for arranging this event. I am both hopeful and confident that this forum will be held at the highest level.
Thank you.

Meeting with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, friends,
I am very pleased to see you again. We all remember your warm welcome during my visit to Athens.
The situation has not changed significantly since that visit, but there are nevertheless some positive developments. They concern the volume of the trade turnover, which has increased by over four percent over last year and by 80 percent over the first two months of this year.
As a whole our trade turnover with the EU has gone up by 43 percent. Our current agenda includes some promising bilateral projects, which unfortunately, are currently on hold but which, in my opinion show positive signs for future development.

I am really glad to have this opportunity to meet with you here in Beijing during this large international conference and to be able to discuss all our bilateral issues along with some problems from our international agenda.
Prime Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras
(retranslated): Mr President, it is a great honour for me to see you in Beijing.
It has been a year since your visit to Greece. Considerable progress has been made in the relations between Russia and Greece. However, we have many unresolved issues that we need to discuss. And the most important ones concern the positive trends in the bilateral trade and the overall situation in the region.
As you have already mentioned, considerable growth in trade has occurred between our countries, and even more considerable growth has occurred in the flow of Russian tourists to Greece. The joint Russia-Greece commission, under which our respective ministries can address current issues, is playing a big role in this growth.
It is very important that our ministries act within the tradition of expanding Russia-Greece relations as this forms the basis of cooperation between our two nations.
