With President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, I am very pleased to see you.
You have just recalled the meeting we had here in China several years ago, which took place during another international event.
You can listen to the translation…
President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman: No need to translate. We all understand some Russian dialect – perhaps, the dialect of central Russia.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, standard Russian language.
To begin with, I would like to say that we are aware of your stance on the Russia-Czech relations, Mr President. To a large extent thanks to you, these relations have been maintained at a high level and have further developed in the past years despite any complications.
I see our conversation today as preparation for your visit to Russia this November. Our agencies have already started preparing for this visit. For example, the Russian Culture Ministry and the Foreign Ministry are working on a large exhibition in Moscow, and we find this news very pleasing. I believe that the Russian public and art lovers will enjoy this exhibition.

In the economic sector, despite the previous years' recession, trade turnover growth of over 44 percent was observed in the beginning of this year. This is a good sign and a good trend we have to preserve.
Milos Zeman: The number of tourists is growing – this is very positive.
Vladimir Putin: This is connected to the gradual restoration of personal incomes, which shrank during the crisis in our country. Today, actual earnings of our citizens have started to gradually increase, and tourist activity is increasing as well.
So, I am very glad about our new meeting.
Milos Zeman: Thank you very much.
This meeting [Belt and Road international forum] is a meeting of extraordinary, outstanding politicians. You were not present after your speech, and soon after the Deputy Premier of China delivered his speech. He spoke for about half an hour. He actually said what the Chinese President had already spoken about, but he was speaking very loudly.
Vladimir Putin: Repetition is the mother of learning.
Milos Zeman: Mr President, I totally agree with you that we must focus on developing specific links. I would like to give several examples.
Let me introduce new Minister of Industry and Trade, Mr Havlicek. He is not to blame for what happened in the past, he has been in the office for only a month. After 2.5 years of work, an intergovernmental commission will meet, and we expect it to give new impetus to our cooperation. This is the first thing.
Second, we have proposed establishing a joint discussion forum, and I know that the Russian side wants a well-regarded man to be responsible for the Czech part of the commission. I am not fully sure that I am well regarded, but if I am, I am totally ready to do this.
As for the third point that you have mentioned – it's the exhibition of Prague Castle treasures.

President of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): I am very glad that you and I have held our first meeting this year. Once again, I cordially welcome you to the Belt and Road international cooperation forum.
As a Russian proverb goes, ”One swallow doesn't make a summer.“ We say, ”One tree is not a forest yet.“ Three years ago, I came out with the Belts and Roads initiative. All leaders of participating countries actively supported this idea and responded. Leveraging joint efforts, this cooperation, including efforts to link Belts and Roads with the 21st century Maritime Silk Road, has achieved initial success.
Our circle of friends is expanding – our common cause brings benefit to the peoples of all countries. Your participation in the forum and your speech at the opening ceremony gives a powerful signal about China and Russia's intention to jointly promote the creation of an open global economy and boost regional cooperation between countries. This has played an important role in holding the forum at a high level. The Chinese side highly appreciates this.
China and Russia are kind neighbours, good friends and stable partners. Since the beginning of the year, the China-Russia relations and cooperation have continued to develop at a high level, with a number of new results achieved.
During the first quarter, mutual trade stood at $18.1 billion, up 2.9–3 percent, which shows a powerful revival tendency.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Chinese-Russian peace and friendship and 60th anniversary of the Society for Chinese-Soviet Friendship. The sides are in the process of developing and implementing plans for holding various festive events.
We are successfully continuing the events marking the Year of Chinese Mass Media in Russia. This has allowed us to strengthen mutual understanding between our nations and has provided a strong public basis of China-Russia relations and a strategic partnership amid the difficult and ever-changing situation in the world. China and Russia have expressed responsibility as great powers.
The joint efforts in settling the political situation in Syria and the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula has played a stabilising role in providing peace and stability in the region and the world.
Developing and expanding our relations is our strategic choice. Whatever the international situation is, we must be strong and go forward shoulder to shoulder, steadily considering the development of our relations as a foreign policy priority. We must make every effort to properly advance our relations and achieve greater results in our cooperation.
Thank you for your attention.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
First of all, congratulations on the successful opening of the large international forum held at your initiative.
As I said in my address today, the timing for this forum is quite good considering the ongoing complicated developments in the world in general and in global economy in particular.
More than ever, we need new cooperation mechanisms in order to open doors to each other, eliminate barriers and obstacles in our cooperation – primarily, in the economy.
In my opinion, the main issue on our bilateral agenda is your upcoming visit to the Russian Federation and we very much look forward to it.
Our governments, the Russian Presidential Executive Office and the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, are currently drafting quite a set of documents, including an action plan toward fulfilling our strategic initiatives for the next few years.
A schedule of contacts has been developed at the level of the governments, ministries, agencies and parliaments of our countries. We are satisfied with the course of our relationship in all these directions.
As concerns the economy, which never leaves our attention, over the last year we have managed to overcome certain negative trends and have achieved a four-percent increase in trade turnover. During the first few months of this year, between January and March, the growth rate was already 37 percent.
What is particularly important and pleasing is that trade patterns are changing structurally. The share of machine engineering and agricultural products is growing for both countries.
However, there is still much room for improvement. Particularly, when it comes to complicated international issues where we always stand side by side and support each other in overcoming various problems. This is certainly a very important factor in international affairs, one that serves to stabilise the political situation.
Let me thank you once again for arranging this event. I am both hopeful and confident that this forum will be held at the highest level.
Thank you.

Meeting with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, friends,
I am very pleased to see you again. We all remember your warm welcome during my visit to Athens.
The situation has not changed significantly since that visit, but there are nevertheless some positive developments. They concern the volume of the trade turnover, which has increased by over four percent over last year and by 80 percent over the first two months of this year.
As a whole our trade turnover with the EU has gone up by 43 percent. Our current agenda includes some promising bilateral projects, which unfortunately, are currently on hold but which, in my opinion show positive signs for future development.

I am really glad to have this opportunity to meet with you here in Beijing during this large international conference and to be able to discuss all our bilateral issues along with some problems from our international agenda.
Prime Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras
(retranslated): Mr President, it is a great honour for me to see you in Beijing.
It has been a year since your visit to Greece. Considerable progress has been made in the relations between Russia and Greece. However, we have many unresolved issues that we need to discuss. And the most important ones concern the positive trends in the bilateral trade and the overall situation in the region.
As you have already mentioned, considerable growth in trade has occurred between our countries, and even more considerable growth has occurred in the flow of Russian tourists to Greece. The joint Russia-Greece commission, under which our respective ministries can address current issues, is playing a big role in this growth.
It is very important that our ministries act within the tradition of expanding Russia-Greece relations as this forms the basis of cooperation between our two nations.

Speech at the One Belt, One Road international forum
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President Xi Jinping, heads of state and governments, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honour for me to participate in the opening ceremony of the Belt and Road international forum. President Xi Jinping informed us about his plans to hold such a representative event back in September at the Russian-Chinese summit in Hangzhou. Of course, we supported this initiative immediately.
Possible concepts for the forum were presented even earlier. Without a doubt, these plans allow for discussion of the huge Eurasian continent’s future in an extended format. Our continent is the home of great civilisations. Peoples of diverse cultures and traditions have lived alongside each other and engaged in trade for centuries.
As you know, the famous Silk Road that once connected almost all of Eurasia ran from one oasis to another, from one water well to another. In the well-known Chinese book, I Ching, with its elaborate language, the well is a symbol of vitality that brings people together to communicate with each other, build trust, connections and friendships.
This historical experience of cooperation and mutual understanding is just as important to us in the 21st century at a time when the world is facing very serious challenges and threats. We have exhausted many former models and indicators of economic development.
In many countries the concept of a social state, coined in the 20th century, is now in crisis. These days, it is not only unable to ensure the steady growth of people’s wealth but can hardly maintain current levels of growth.
The risks of a disrupted global economic and technological space are becoming increasingly obvious. Protectionism is becoming a common practice that manifests itself in unilateral illegitimate restrictions, including how technology is supplied and distributed. The ideas of openness, freedom of trade are often rejected even by those who supported them so vigorously in the past.
The disparity in socioeconomic development and the crisis the globalisation model finds itself in are fraught with negative consequences both for relations between states and for international security.
Poverty, lack of financial security, and the massive gap in the level of development between countries and regions all fuel international terrorism, extremism and illegal migration.
We will not be able to tackle these challenges unless we overcome this stagnation in global economic development.
Let us not forget about those threats that stem from regional conflicts. Areas of smouldering disagreements still exist across Eurasia. In order to eliminate those conflicts, first of all, we need to abandon hostile rhetoric, mutual accusations and rebukes that only aggravate the situation. Altogether, none of the old approaches to conflict resolution should be used to solve modern problems. We need fresh and stereotype-free ideas.
I believe Eurasia can work out and propose a constructive and positive agenda on issues relating to security, improving relations between states, economic development, social change, better administration and the search for new forces capable of driving growth.
For the global community, we must be an example of a collective, innovative and constructive future based on justice, equality and respect for national sovereignty, international law and the unwavering principles of the United Nations.
However, desire and will alone are not enough to follow through on this agenda. Efficient tools for this type of cooperation are required. These can be created through integration. Today there are many thriving integration projects in Eurasia. We support them and are vested in their further development.
Many are aware of the fact that Russia and its partners are building the Eurasian Economic Union. The parties of the EAEU have similar views on Eurasian integration and it is very important to us that the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are participating in this forum.
We welcome China’s One Belt, One Road initiative. By proposing this initiative, President Xi Jinping has demonstrated an example of a creative approach toward fostering integration in energy, infrastructure, transport, industry and humanitarian collaboration, about which I have just talked at length.
I believe that by adding together the potential of all the integration formats like the EAEU, the OBOR, the SCO and the ASEAN, we can build the foundation for a larger Eurasian partnership. This is the approach that, we believe, should be applied to the agenda proposed today by the People’s Republic of China.
We would welcome the involvement of our European colleagues from the EU states in this partnership. This would make it truly concordant, balanced and all encompassing, and will allow us to realise a unique opportunity to create a common cooperation framework from the Atlantic to the Pacific – for the first time in history.
Colleagues,
It is necessary that already today, we start acting upon the development strategy of the large Eurasian partnership. Thus, we can set an ambitious goal of making the flow of goods across as expedient, convenient and unhindered as possible. Just now, in his address, President Xi Jinping spoke about lifting bureaucratic barriers for trade flows between China and Kazakhstan. We can see it happening along other routes.
Of course, it is much easier and more efficient to work with the most advanced logistics technology while minimising associated administrative costs. In achieving this goal, we can rely on the substantial and valuable experience of the World Trade Organisation. Let me remind you that last February, WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement came into effect. Of course, we must expand such agreements and develop a more robust Eurasian agreement on facilitating trade.
Additionally, I would like to stress that Russia is not only willing to be a reliable trading partner but also seeks to invest in the creation of joint ventures and new production capacities in partnering states, to invest in industrial facilities, sales and services.
It is important that entrepreneurs and business people in our countries earn money and achieve success, create competitive technology and production alliances together. In order for this cooperation to be efficient, we must seek unification and, eventually, develop common standards, technical regulations for traditional industrial and agricultural goods as well as new hi-tech products.
Furthermore, it is necessary to eliminate infrastructure restrictions for integration – mainly by creating a system of modern and well-connected transport corridors. Russia with its unique geographic location is willing to engage in this joint activity.
We are consistently upgrading our maritime, railway and road infrastructure, expanding the capacity of the Baikal-Amur Mainline and the Trans-Siberian Railway, investing significant resources into improvements to the Northeast Passage in order for it to become a global competitive transport artery.
If we look at the bigger picture, the infrastructure projects within the EAEU and the One Belt, One Road initiative in conjunction with the Northeast Passage can completely reconfigure transportation on the Eurasian continent, which is the key to exploring new territory and intensifying economic and investment activity. Let us pave these roads to development and prosperity together.
Large projects in infrastructure, energy, transport and modern hi-tech industries certainly require substantial private investments. Therefore, it is important to create convenient, clear and predictable conditions for investors and to establish the smooth exchange of best practices. For example, we have used the experience of the Asia-Pacific countries to develop preferential terms for investors in the Priority Development Areas in Russia’s Far East.
We expect newly established financial institutions like New Development Bank (BRICS Development Bank) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to offer a supporting hand to private investors. And of course, quality integration is only possible with the support of strong human capital, qualified professionals, advanced technology and research.
To create this foundation, we propose that the development of joint education platforms be stepped up and that the interaction between universities and business schools be strengthened. My invitation remains open for joint work within major scientific centres and research projects, including the development of large international research facilities and laboratories for collective use.
Colleagues,
It is obvious that the ideas and initiatives of this forum’s participants require further discussion. And we are certainly willing to get involved in these talks. Let me take this opportunity to invite political figures and representatives of civic and business communities to visit Russia this year, to attend the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in June and the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok in September.
On a final note, I would like to stress that Russia does not simply view the future of the Eurasian partnership as the mere establishment of new ties between states and economies. This partnership must shift the political and economic landscape of the continent and bring peace, stability, prosperity and a new quality of life to Eurasia.
Understandably our citizens need security, confidence in the future and the opportunity to be productive and improve the wealth and well-being of their families. It is our common duty and responsibility to ensure they have these opportunities.
In this respect, the greater Eurasia is not an abstract geopolitical arrangement but, without exaggeration, a truly civilisation-wide project looking toward the future.
I believe that by maintaining the spirit of cooperation, we can achieve that future. I want to thank President Xi Jinping for this well-timed initiative, promising such splendid prospects for cooperation.
Thank you for your attention. I wish you all good luck in the tasks that we’ll take on together.
