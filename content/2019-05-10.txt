Speech at the awards ceremony
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, sports fans, spectators and athletes,
I congratulate you on the end of the 8th Night Hockey League season. Thank you for inspiring millions of people to get involved in fitness and sports.
I would like to congratulate the winners – for the third time, it is the team from Yekaterinburg. I want to wish you success and say that this is a true accomplishment. Almost one thousand teams play today in the Night Hockey League, and 162 teams came here to Sochi to take part in the playoff stage. There is immense competition. I saw the so-called amateurs play – they were simply impressive. It is not so easy for our stars to play against you, particularly since I represent you on that team.
Today, the Ice Hockey World Championship starts. The Russian national team will play against Norway, a strong team. Let us wish our team success.
