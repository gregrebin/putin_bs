President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, friends, let me wish you a warm welcome to Moscow.
We place great importance on developing our relations, which have always been built on the basis of friendship and consideration for mutual interests. It is a very timely and important moment to have this chance to discuss with you the situation in the region.
Look at what we can do to fight international terrorism, and, of course, outline future plans in trade and the economy, particularly given that we have managed to reverse the negative trend in our bilateral trade over the last year.
Welcome!
Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed Al Nahyan (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
We are very pleased to have this chance to meet today. There is no question that this meeting takes place at an important moment, when we are reflecting on the steps to take to continue developing our privileged relations, Mr President.
Of course, there are many challenges in the Middle East region today, and I hope to discuss this with you today.
