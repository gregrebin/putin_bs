Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
Mr Karzai, I am very happy to become acquainted with a man, who has now assumed responsibility for the future of Afghanistan. As you know, relations between Russia and Afghanistan have been actively expanding for a long time. Although we have seen different periods in our relations, we are neighbours; and I think it is our duty to build the highest level of bilateral relations for the benefit of both nations.
I believe we have a lot to discuss because our countries are facing numerous tasks in the areas of politics, military development and economic recovery.
We are very glad to see you. Welcome to Russia.
