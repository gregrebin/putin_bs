Vladimir Putin:
Dear Emomali Sharipovich,
Allow me to wish you a warm welcome to Russia. Thank you for accepting this invitation.
The first thing I would like to say is that we follow attentively the efforts being made to build up Tajikistanâ€™s strength in every area, politically and economically.
It is with satisfaction that we note that trade between our countries is increasing. Indeed, our trade turnover rose by more than 55 percent over the first quarter of this year. This is a very positive trend when we consider that last year too, trade between our countries increased by more than 40 percent. But in absolute terms this result is still not high compared to your neighbours in the region. Trade turnover with Kazakhstan, for example, now exceeds $5 billion, with Uzbekistan is more than $1 billion, and trade with Kyrgyzstan is even a little higher than with Tajikistan.
But we have a very high level of political cooperation and mutual trust. We really do see Tajikistan as our strategic partner and ally.
