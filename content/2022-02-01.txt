The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Holiness,
My congratulations to you on the holiday.
Patriarch Kirill: Thank you kindly.
Vladimir Putin: The entire Russian Orthodox Church celebrates Enthronement Day as a holiday. This is a special event in the life of the Russian Orthodox Church and also the entire country because the role of the Church in the life of society is growing and it has become very important in recent years. Everything you are doing to promote peace and harmony in Russia, in our country, and to maintain social well-being in society is extremely important for our country.
I would like to congratulate you once again and wish you all the best.
Patriarch Kirill: Thank you so much for your kind words, Mr President.
Throughout its history, the Church has strived to do everything it can to help people become better and lead better lives. This is a dual goal. The Church is always concerned about the living conditions of people, their material and spiritual circumstances. It is concerned about ensuring the continuous spiritual development of each individual regardless even of whatever difficulties are encountered in life. This has been the mission of the Church for two thousand years.
It is not always completely successful in resolving its tasks, but I thank the Lord for what the Church is doing today. It is doing all it can to improve the lives of people and to help people grow, primarily spiritually and intellectually, and even become physically healthier.
Vladimir Putin: My greetings, your Holiness.
Patriarch Kirill: Thank you, Mr President.
