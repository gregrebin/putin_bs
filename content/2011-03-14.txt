While on this subject, I  with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan today. They have suffered a great misfortune of course, a huge national disaster. Our task now is to help our neighbours, and I have already given this instruction to our Cabinet. I know that you have already met to discuss various matters, including energy supplies in order to help restore the energy balance that was disrupted by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed. We have agreed that our ministries will stay in contact and take all the necessary decisions. 
At the same time of course, we need to keep watch on the state of other sites too. We are close neighbours after all, and in this respect our task is simply to monitor the general situation, including, of course, the situation with Japan’s nuclear power plants. As the Emergency Situations Ministry and Rosatom have reported, they do have problems in Japan with these power plants right now, but things are under control overall. I heard the same thing today from the Japanese Prime Minister. Whatever the case, these are complex energy facilities and we will of course need to continue working together with our Japanese colleagues to monitor the situation.
Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin: Mr President, I will begin with this last issue, if you permit.
“I always supported all-round development of our economic ties with Japan. Japan is not just our neighbour but also a big market, and there is a lot of potential for cooperation. In this situation our duty is to provide moral support of course, but we also need to keep the future in mind too.”
Acting on your instruction, the Cabinet met on Saturday to discuss our proposals for how to help our partners in the Far East, in Japan specifically, in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. Of course, we need to make a thorough analysis of these events ourselves and draw our own conclusions too. The IAEA will also investigate what has happened. One of the things that exacerbated the situation it seems was that the nuclear power station in question was built in a seismically active area, and near the coast, what’s more. This meant that first the tremors and then the tsunami increased the situation’s seriousness.
We are drafting proposals for aid for our partners. I sent a letter today to Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Banri Kaeida with proposals to hold talks on organised provision of assistance, including energy supplies. They have already made requests concerning gas supplies, and Gazprom is working right now on organising two gas carriers to ship 100,000 tons of liquefied natural gas in April and again in May, and I think this all going to be possible. 
We are studying the possibilities for increasing LNG supplies. There are some problems in that contracts have already been signed for most of the available supplies, but we will of course make sure that any supplies still available will go above all to Japan. In this respect we will have to hold additional talks with the participants in the Sakhlin-2 consortium.
Dmitry Medvedev: I think the situation today is such that even though contracts have already been signed for LNG supplies, our partners should also be willing to make some concessions. Japan, one of our neighbours, and a big country, has been hit by a huge disaster after all, and in this situation it could be possible to make some changes to the current contracts. I think this is something that could be discussed.
Igor Sechin: Yes, our position is that we need to help Japan, of course.
Furthermore, nuclear energy accounts for 30 percent of Japan’s energy supplies, and this balance will change now that our Japanese partners are being forced to shut down reactors. Eleven units have already been shut down of the total 54 reactors they have in operation. Gas accounts for 17 percent of their energy, and coal for 22 percent. We are ready to increase coal supplies. A delegation from SUEK will visit Japan this week, and Mechel is also ready to send a delegation. This will also be a subject for discussion with our colleagues.
As you know, our Far East region also has reserve hydropower capacity. In the long term, we could redirect around 6,000 megawatts in electricity supplies to Japan. This would require some organisational work first, though. There is a project to build an undersea cable, and some preliminary work has already been done. The idea is to lay the cable from Sakhalin to Japan, and we would also need to lay cable to Sakhalin itself – a total of 32 km of cable. This project could be ready quite quickly. Of course, the work itself would take a couple of years, but it would provide a long-term solution. We are ready to work on this together with our Japanese colleagues and their companies, and we could have the proposals ready and send them to our colleagues very soon.
Dmitry Medvedev: I always supported all-round development of our economic ties with Japan because this country is not just our neighbour but also a big market, and there is a lot of potential for cooperation. In this situation our duty is to provide moral support of course, but we also need to keep the future in mind too, so work on this. We have agreed to keep in touch on this issue, and if our Japanese colleagues come to any decisions on these matters they will keep us informed.
Igor Sechin: Yes, Mr President. We have already begun this work.
Dmitry Medvedev: Good.
Igor Sechin: Regarding the meeting you held in Khakassia, you gave the instruction to report today on the work to get the draft law on anti-terrorism protection of energy sector facilities ready for submission. You gave the instruction to draft this law following the terrorist attack on the Baksan Hydroelectric Power Station. This document was the object of very thorough work over a 6-month period. We submitted it to the Presidential Executive Office and received comments. We have now worked through all of these points together with the Executive Office, and today, if you agree, we will send the draft law to the Executive Office for the final approval procedures.
