I am happy to give you the following information.
In 1992, the Russian Federation unilaterally stopped sending its strategic aviation on long-range patrols. Unfortunately, not everyone has followed our example and other countries’ strategic aviation continues patrols to this day. This creates certain problems for the Russian Federation in ensuring its security.
In response to this situation, I have decided that Russia’s strategic aviation will resume patrols on a permanent basis.
At midnight, today, August 17, 14 strategic missile-carriers, support and refuelling aircraft took off from seven air force bases in different parts of the Russian Federation and began a patrol involving a total of 20 aircraft. As from today, such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis. These patrols are strategic in nature. The aircraft involved in today’s patrol will spend around 20 hours in the air, with refuelling, in coordination with the Navy.
The patrols will take place above all in areas where Russian Federation shipping and economic activity is most active.
We hope that our partners will show understanding towards the resumption of patrols by Russia’s strategic aviation.
Our pilots have spent too long on the ground. We have strategic aviation but it spends practically no time in the air. Flights took place now and again only during large-scale military exercises, and as you know, we have held very few such exercises over the last 15 years. As I said, our pilots have spent too long on the ground. I know that they are happy to now have this chance to begin a new life and we wish them luck.
