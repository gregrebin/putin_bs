The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Van Cliburn, allow me to wish you a warm welcome to Russia, and present you with this high state award of the Russian Federation, the Order of Friendship. It is an acknowledgement of your major personal contribution to the development of Russian-American cultural ties, and your efforts in increasing mutual understanding and trust between the people of our countries.
Dear friend, we very much appreciate the fact that you were able to come to Moscow in the year of your 70th birthday. And you have our special thanks for devoting your birthday concert to the victims of terrorist acts in the Russian Federation. This once again shows the important humane mission of musical culture, and what you do inspires respect, Mr. Van Cliburn. I am certain that your concert at the Conservatory Great Hall will be an important event in our cultural life, an important event for everyone who loves your art, and there are plenty of such people in our country.
Your legendary performance at the First International Tchaikovsky competition in 1958 was not just a revelation for connoisseurs of music â€“ it was a bright symbol in the positive development of relations, the positive changes in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. And to this day you are a good and true friend of Russia and its people.
I would like to stress the fact that the important award that you are being presented with today is an expression of particular gratitude for your efforts in broadening contacts between our societies and people. Thank you very much.
