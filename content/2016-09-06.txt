President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, welcome to Russia.
I am pleased to see you.
I hope that your visit this time will be as productive as our previous meeting. We discussed a whole host of opportunities for expanding our collaboration.
I know that this time you wanted to see our defence industry capabilities. I hope that you have been able to see what we can offer our friends and partners. Your Majesty, I would also like to know your opinion about what you saw today.
And naturally, it is very important today to talk about your view of what is going on in the region. I had an opportunity in China to discuss these issues with some of our colleagues from the region.
In this connection, Your Majesty’s visit is very timely and I am happy to see you.
Welcome to Russia!
King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifaof Bahrain (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for the invitation and for your warm welcome. I would like to convey to you the best wishes of the people of Bahrain.
Today, we were pleased to visit an exhibition featuring the latest models of advanced weapon systems. The Deputy Prime Minister [Dmitry Rogozin]
and the Defence Minister [Sergei Shoigu]
gave us a very warm welcome.
Indeed, we would like to get a closer look at your modern products, your arms manufacturing complex. And naturally, taking this into account, we build our relations in accordance with our needs. And, glory to God, everything that we agreed on earlier is being put into practice. However, of course, we, Russia and Bahrain, would like to set even more objectives for ourselves.
Mr President, you and your leadership, your Government are held in high regard in the region and throughout the world. And we thank you.
