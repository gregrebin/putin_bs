Meeting with Russian Human Rights Commissioner Ella Pamfilova.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Pamfilova, it has been a year since you have assumed the post of Human Rights Commissioner.
Russian Human Rights Commissioner Ella Pamfilova
: More than 18 months already, Mr President, and they flew by in a flash.
Vladimir Putin: The year is coming to an end, and you and I meet regularly. Is there anything you would like to talk about?
Ella Pamfilova: First, I would like to thank you for pointing out a number of important human rights aspects in your Address [to the Federal Assembly]. This is of great importance. I would also like to thank you for your constant support of the institution of the human rights commissioners. This is very important, especially for my colleagues. This support has made the institution more recognisable and it is now in greater demand.
In the final count, this is not merely for the sake of status. People are getting more opportunities now, especially the unprotected, low income people – those, for whom it is best to protect their rights using this institution as they do not have the opportunity to use the media or hire expensive lawyers. It is the regional Commissioner who gets to the rural communities and meets with the old people, people with disabilities and all those categories, which are in the most difficult situation.
So, thank you for that. These days my colleagues and I have been discussing the entire range of issues facing us, and I am certain that despite all the difficulties, this institution has become more mobile and efficient.
As people share their most pressing problems with us, I would like to discuss one such issue with you – one that ever more people are bringing up now. This has to do with the growing number of all sorts of unreasonable payments people are forced to make – there is such a tendency. I will give you a few examples.
It is simply astonishing when our authorities at different levels plug the holes in their not-always-effective activities, or try to plug them with the help of the public, increasing these fees, which are not always founded. It is particularly ironic, I have data that I will show you later, in instances when money is taken from poorer people to give to richer ones; it is an absolutely abysmal situation.
I would like to focus on several aspects pertaining to inadequate legislation and law enforcement practices. (Ella Pamfilova went on to discuss shortcomings in collecting land taxes and charging contributions for overhaul repairs of housing. According to Ms Pamfilova, there are many unexamined factors causing justified indignation among the public.)
Another important issue concerns the balance of environmental and socioeconomic interests. There is a whole range of high-profile cases in many regions where a “Bermuda Triangle” is formed, consisting of the federal authorities, local authorities and residents. The “Bermuda Triangle” of misunderstanding, inability to align interests, inability to talk to people and take their needs into account. The flipside is knowing how to explain the importance of particular rules for the state. This is something that should be learned.
Let’s take a particularly acute situation with regard to Lake Baikal. There is a great misunderstanding and inability of the parties to explain their reasoning to one another. This is also true in Bashkortostan with construction of the Kronoshpan, where they are trying to build, say, a factory. For example, I was able to strike down an attack on the Water Code, where people were trying to fill the Volga floodplains to build elite cottages and so on.
The topic of harmonising environmental and socioeconomic interests is increasingly relevant because people are get involved in it more actively. And here, we need to find opportunities to discuss it; that is the role of an “open government,” rather than sweeping the problem under the rug.

Presentation of state decorations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
The presentation of state decorations is a wonderful opportunity to single out the achievements of the people who deserve to be known by the entire country, to thank you for your labour, your talent, heroism and your contribution to strengthening our state, developing our society, resolving the key tasks facing our country.
Time keeps coming up with new challenges, testing our unity and our readiness to jointly protect and defend Russia’s national interests. This is a time when we especially feel the importance of trust, solidarity, generation ties, the importance of appreciating our national history and its lessons, relying on the traditions of fraternity and accord that unite our multi-ethnic people.
We have always lived with trust in good and justice, capable of pushing aside everything that stood in our way, all the differences in the name of our love for our Fatherland. It is this unity that makes us stronger today. Our society has always respected those who commendably do their professional and civic duty, who are engaged in creative search, working towards new victories, those who feel their responsibility to their country, who demonstrate valour and courage.
Thus, complex programmes of long space flight missions require stamina, willpower and true courage. We seem to be getting used to these flights, but every such event is a feat of heroism, a huge risk. For the successful performance of such a flight Sergei Ryazansky receives the titles of Hero of Russia and Russian Federation Pilot-Cosmonaut. Internal Troops Colonel Serik Sultangabiyev has also demonstrated true courage. In a critical situation during military exercises he took the blow to rescue his comrade, deserving the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of Russia.
Russian journalists are working in ‘hot-spots’, carrying on with honour the traditions of the legendary war correspondents of the Great Patriotic War. They report from the frontlines, telling the truth about what is happening in military conflict zones. For his professionalism and courage, special correspondent of the National State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK) Yevgeny Poddubny is awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky.
I would like to say the warmest words today about those who work in production, work the land and develop new fields. I would like to speak of those who create the strong foundation that we need for our Fatherland to flourish and our people to prosper. Alexander Yezhevsky made a great contribution to the development of agricultural machine building. Only recently, he celebrated his 100th birthday, but he continues working despite his venerable age. Thank you for coming here today.
The energy and talent of the people dedicated to what they are doing result in the most outstanding discoveries and breakthroughs in scientific knowledge and technical progress, in medicine and education. The works of Academician Gennady Romanenko, vice-president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, are widely known. He is one of the developers of the fundamental principles of Russia’s agrarian policy.
Among the recipients are scientists of world renown: Nobel prize winner and respected public figure Zhores Alfyorov.
Also here is the founder of the top cardiology school – top not only in this country, but also one of the best in the world – an outstanding surgeon who performs extremely complicated surgeries and has saved countless lives – Leonid Bokeria.
Also with us is a group of people representing the humanitarian sphere. Natalya Solzhenitsyna is making a great contribution to preserving the historical, literary and philosophical heritage of Russia, to promoting educational and charitable initiatives.
People, whose creative achievements and fruitful public work are known to all, have become full cavaliers of the Order For Services to the Fatherland. They are Nikita Mikhalkov, Yury Solomin, Oleg Tabakov and Gennady Khazanov, and the renowned master of national and world opera Dmitry Khvorostovsky.
It is a pleasure to welcome this country’s good friends, our partners who are actively and constructively working to strengthen economic and cultural ties with Russia and are assisting in establishing mutual understanding and trust between peoples. These are Chairman of the Korean financial-industrial corporation Lotte Mr Dong Bin Shin, and a well-known British public figure, director of the Science Museum Group, Mr Ian Blatchford.
Friends,
Such ceremonies are not simply a tribute to our tradition or state protocol. This is also a chance to meet with gifted, interesting, enthusiastic people who have been lucky enough to find their path and do their job for the benefit of their country. Your achievements and success, you courage and steadfastness, your loyalty to your Fatherland is convincing proof of the fact that present-day Russia is worthy of its great predecessors and its great history.
Please accept my congratulations on receiving your state decorations. I wish you all the best.

Visit to exhibition honouring Russia Today’s 10th anniversary. With Editor-in-Chief of Russia Today Margarita Simonyan.
In particular, the President viewed the River of Time installation, bringing together over 100 events in Russia Today’s 10-year history.
Earlier, the President sent a congratulatory message to the television company’s staff, congratulating them on 10 years of broadcasts.

Speech at celebration honouring 10th anniversary of Russia Today television channel
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, friends,
I am very pleased to be here today among you to celebrate the 10th anniversary since the start of Russia Today’s work. When this idea was first born, I’ll tell you honestly, I did not expect that it would be implemented with such spirit, on such a large scale, and bring together such an outstanding group of talented individuals.
Just now, when I was looking at instances of your work and how you do this, I thought: our greatest merit lies in letting you prove yourselves, in liberating you, not forcing you to do anything, ensuring you work freely, giving you the chance to have fun and work at your own enjoyment. And we can see the result – which, of course, is excellent.
I want to congratulate you on your 10th anniversary, on this special date, on the fact that you have been able to achieve a great deal in these years – you know all this, but I am will say it again: creating six information channels, including a documentary channel, as well as a global video news agency.
Today, it is my pleasure to note that Russia Today is the number one TV news channel in the world on YouTube. The total number of views has exceeded three billion. Just now, Margarita [Simonyan] showed me that it’s at nearer four billion – 3.6 or 3.8 billion – which is an absolute record.
Let me say that these are amazing achievements. These are real breakthroughs in the information world, in terms of developing up to date, leading content and a wide variety of topics and programmes, and creative presentation of materials.
We saw a good example of this today, it was like when our seamen rip their shirts. I can see here that this is how your correspondents work as well, fighting for points. That’s really impressive. But don’t rip anything else off yourselves. Just the seamen’s shirts, and stop at that.
All this is truly important; you have been able to create an international team of TV stars, and that is a guarantee of success. Well-known journalists, as well as newcomers to the profession, from around the world are happy to work with you.
You compete on the same playing field as international news giants, and are already beating them according to many parameters. In some regions of the world, you have higher ratings than traditional news organisations that have long been operating in the international information market.
The Russia Today television channel is now accessible to 700 million viewers. Naturally, we do not know how many people actually watch it, but it is accessible to 700 million. This is a very large audience, but it can be even greater. But this is already a lot, so we need to tap into this audience.
Today, when the situation in global politics is, frankly speaking, complicated, it is more important than ever for your and our voice, your and our position, to be heard not only by politicians, not just the political elite, but also, first and foremost, by ordinary people around the world.
In order to increase your viewer numbers and your popularity among them, you will certainly need a high level of professionalism. And you reassert this professionalism daily through your hard work and your achievements.
No topics are off-limits to you – this is also highly important. You provide different points of view on nearly every significant event. As we say, you do not weigh viewers down with heavy, blunt propaganda cliches. Your greatest strength is presenting information freely and independently.
Of course, here in Russia we – by “we” I mean the Russian authorities – are no saints either, and we make mistakes; I suppose some things could be improved or are not as good as they could be. So objective presentation of materials concerning our nation is, again, highly important as well. I hope that it will remain this way. That is how the media should be: objective and interesting. Otherwise, there will be no demand for it.
Let me tell you something that may be somewhat unexpected and perhaps even strange. When I was viewing your materials, I looked at your questions and comments from politicians, my colleagues from other countries, and here is something I noticed: I agree with them on certain issues. Why? Because civil society, people like you, creative, free, and sometimes somewhat unbridled, have their own view of things. It may be no worse than ours, or it may, in some ways, be better. But we, the people who hold the responsibility for making decisions and the consequences of those decisions, also have our own view on things, and also have a right to our opinions.
Your objective is not to serve the interests of the Russian authorities, but to present these different points of view in order for average citizens, viewers and listeners to have a general, correct, multifaceted, three-dimensional view on whether the authorities are making the right choices, whether they are working toward the interests of society and all citizens, or in the interests of certain elites or quasi-elites, monopolistic groups, trying to gain power. This mission is highly important.
Many media throughout the world receive financial support from the government, but that’s entirely beside the point. What’s most important with regard to Russia Today is that we do not control you – I have already said this in different ways – and we do not meddle in your fieldwork, as well as other work. You have your own editorial policies and we respect that approach. Moreover, if somebody in the government stops respecting this and tries to control you, you will certainly be unable to reach this level of creativity. And we are deeply interested in you being effective.
At the same time, it would be strange if you ignored the position of the Russian authorities or joined your colleagues from other countries for whom informational confrontations, in this case with our country, have become a kind of trend. There is absolutely no need to get drawn into this interchange, in my view. There is no reason to get involved in this contest; we simply need to state our position – that is the power of free media.
Indeed, you broadcast our point of view on nearly all issues – with regard to Russia’s internal life and international issues – but we do not hide our positions. In this respect, I feel, that is the main support for our work: the fact that our policy is entirely transparent, I assure you, with the exception of certain very specific things. We have nothing to hide. It is a truthful policy, and we have never had anything to conceal from anyone. That is the strength of our policies and, I believe, your work, because you and we have nothing to hide.
Your television channel gives people the opportunity to receive objective information about Russia and, incidentally, provides a free platform for politicians from other countries who want to express their opinion on current events. We are always ready for open, constructive discussions.
There are more than enough examples here. In recent years, so-called double standards, a clear division into “insiders” and “outsiders,” (I mean countries and regions of the world), distortion of events and their causes – they are simply coming out, and this is becoming entirely clear and conspicuous. For example, silence concerning the humanitarian catastrophes in, say, eastern Ukraine, which you showed very clearly.
It is regrettable that even international human rights activists seem to be completely tongue-tied regarding many glaring facts. Whereas you provide that information. Your channel has made an enormous input into telling about the true events in Ukraine overall, and in southeast Ukraine, as well as other regions of the world.
You have the same open and objective information policy with regard to the events in Syria: today, we saw a great deal about this here as well, and overall, you are doing much to counter terrorism. It is well known that the media and the Internet are among its weapons – perhaps even its primary weapon. They use these media to recruit young people, and spread the ideological disease of terrorism. The media’s responsibility in this situation increases exponentially. You understand this well and provide fair coverage of all events, promoting the unification of people in the fight against this threat.
Of course, your channel traditionally gives a great deal of attention to Russia itself. You talk about the Russian regions, the people living here, their work, their civic initiatives, our magnificent nature, our cultural heritage, the customs of our multi-ethnic nation, our values and our history, the achievements of our country, true problems rather than made-up ones, of which we have more than enough, and how they are being resolved. You approach these topics both responsibly and creatively. I want to thank you for this, wish you success and promise that we will not get in your way.
Thank you!

Meeting with Head of Rosfinmonitoring Yury Chikhanchin
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Head of the of Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring) Yury Chikhanchin.

Meeting with Head of Rosfinmonitoring Yury Chikhanchin.
In the run-up to the extraordinary meeting of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), Mr Chikhanchin
told the President about the many Russian initiatives to fight the financing of terrorism. In particular, Russia’s suggestions include freezing transactions conducted in the interests of terrorist groups and involving oil and cultural assets.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chikhanchin, you were going to meet with colleagues from FATF and discuss combatting the financing of terrorism.
Head of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring Yury Chikhanchin: That’s right.
Vladimir Putin: What proposals are they working on?
Yury Chikhanchin: In the coming days, FATF will hold an extraordinary session. This has to do with the decision made buy the G20 summit where you spoke and raised the issue of financing terrorism. The Russian delegation is going and we will raise several issues.
The first issue pertains to UN Security Council Resolution No. 2199. We suggest criminalising, or freezing, economic resources, first and foremost, oil, oil products, cultural assets and everything else. We will insist for a new standard to be formed and for all countries to adhere to this decision.
The second issue we would like to draw attention to is the creation of a unified international list of terrorists – in other words, individuals who participated in ISIS events. These are people who participated and went back, and there should be a Security Council resolution about them, as with the Al-Qaeda list. We believe this is justified. Naturally, this should be followed by corresponding measures, i.e., freezing these people’s assets, introducing other sanctions, and so on.
The third set of issues we would like to raise has to do with identifying financial centres, financial institutions, used by ISIS and taking corresponding measures directly in the country involved.
Vladimir Putin: To monitor money wires.
Yury Chikhanchin: Yes, through money wires, as you also said at the G20 summit. We currently have a methodology, and we will try to explain it at a certain point. Moreover, I would like to say that this methodology has been launched in CIS countries under the auspices of CIS heads of financial intelligence.
We have proposed it and already talked it through with several countries, shared our methodology, particularly with our Australian colleagues. They were able to use our methodology to identify several people participating in ISIS, and appropriate actions are being taken. The same is true for Korea. Today, we are working with Armenia and Kazakhstan. In other words, the methodology is yielding results. We would like for the entire world to try it. That is our primary objective, our main goal for this visit. I will report to you about the results.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
