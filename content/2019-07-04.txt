With Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu, how is the work progressing in Severomorsk?
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu
: Mr President, we have made the necessary arrangements and established a headquarters, which is working very actively. We are using the services of the submarine designers and industry representatives to assess the volume and timeframe of repairs.
Our first conclusion is that the submarine can be repaired. Moreover, this must be done, in this particular case. We are now assessing the timeframe.

We have pinpointed the main reason for the tragedy: a fire in the battery flat that spread out.
Vladimir Putin: What about the nuclear power unit?
Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, the nuclear power unit has been sealed off and all personnel have been removed. Plus, the crew has taken the necessary measures to save the unit, which is in working order. This means we can repair the submersible quickly.
Vladimir Putin: Completely?
Sergei Shoigu: Yes, completely.
Next, we have a group working with the submariners’ families. We are working with each family separately. As per your instructions, we will provide the necessary assistance in accordance with our laws and regulations and, on the other hand, because it is our duty to the deceased sailors.
Assistance measures include good education for those children who are still studying and a decent standard of living for everyone, just as we did following similar bitter tragedies.
The families with minor children will receive their deceased husbands’ salaries until the children come of age.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu, please submit your proposals on awarding state decorations to the crew.
Sergei Shoigu: Will do.
