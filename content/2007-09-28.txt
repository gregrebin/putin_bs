President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister!
I am very glad to meet with you again. I am very pleased to note that contacts between our governmental agencies have continued at practically every level. We have cooperated well in the political sphere and our trade is growing: it is up 40 percent over last year. But there are problems. The amount of Spanish investments in Russia seems to us extremely small.
In general, however, we are pleased with how our relations are developing. I am confident that your visit will be a good impetus for the development of relations between our countries.
Welcome, Mr Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero: Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thirty years ago, Spain and Russia restored diplomatic relations. As a result we get together constantly, and I believe that today, such a beautiful day in such a beautiful city, is an auspicious moment for our meeting.
Over the thirty years since diplomatic relations were restored, we have made great progress. There have been many meetings and contacts, and we are convinced that we have an opportunity to further develop economic, political and cultural relations.
Spain is a modern, open country with strong economic growth. It has large enterprises working in construction and energy, and their business has been growing.
Our culture and language are very popular in Russia, something that delights us, just as Russiaâ€™s culture, history and language are very important for us now and have generated very keen interest in Spain.
I am confident that we will have a very useful meeting, and I wish Russia all the best.
