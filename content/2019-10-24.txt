With President of Angola Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am glad to welcome you in Sochi again. And, of course, I have warm memories of our productive talks in Moscow in April, on April 4 of this year. We appreciate your participation in the first Russia-Africa Summit, which no doubt will be an important step in the development of the entire range of Russian-African ties.
Mr President,
Next year we will mark a significant anniversary: 45 years since the declaration of Angola’s independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.
Over this period, Angola has become Russia’s important partner in Africa. Our interstate ties are traditionally friendly in nature. We are promoting our practices in the trade, economic, investment and cultural areas and maintain an active political dialogue.

At our April talks in Moscow, we reaffirmed our mutual political will to develop bilateral cooperation with a view to making it a genuine strategic partnership. It was included in the joint communique signed at the end of your visit.
I think that now we should focus on implementing the agreements that we reached. Russian agencies, organisations and government corporations are already working on this. We expect that our Angolan friends have also started to put them into effect.
We are very glad to see you, Mr President, and I hope that our meeting today will also help strengthen our bilateral ties.
Thank you.
President of the Republic of Angola Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco (retranslated): Thank you very much, President Putin and the delegation that is accompanying you.
We came to Russia on a state visit in April, and today we are here not in a bilateral format but mostly to take part in the first Russia-Africa Summit, which is quite important for us.
Russia is a country that helped the African countries that fought for their national independence. That struggle was hard enough, it took us a long time, but eventually with your help we have all become independent, except Eastern Sahara, which is not in the best shape.
But today Africa is free, largely through the efforts of the Russian people, the efforts of the former Soviet Union. Africa is free through those efforts.
At present we are at a new stage. At this stage we want to count not only on your assistance, but also on cooperation between our countries. Such cooperation is already happening but has yet to reach the level that is possible.
There is great potential on both sides that we can reach. This is what we have wanted to do since April, the time of my first visit.
We know, Mr President, that your delegation has been trying for several days to hold this event. We are glad that you have found the time to meet with us.

With President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are very glad to see all of you in Sochi.
Mr President, this is not your first visit to Russia. I hope your stay in Sochi and participation in the Russia-Africa summit will leave you with the most positive impressions and will further promote relations between Russia and Equatorial Guinea.
We consider your country to be a promising partner for Russia. Our interstate cooperation is traditionally friendly. Last year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations.
We maintain continuous political dialogue. Recently we signed an agreement on cooperation between the upper houses of our parliaments. Our foreign ministries also stay in contact.

Mr President, we are grateful to you for your invariable support of a number of our initiatives at international venues, including the UN. This applies to the problems of glorifying Nazism. You voted for the draft resolutions on international information security and on not being the first to deploy weapons in space, to name a few.
I would like to note that, regrettably, indicators of our trade are still unstable. It is going up and down. I think we must improve this situation by joint efforts and make our cooperation more stable.
We believe we have the best prospects of cooperation in geological prospecting, joint mining and processing of hydrocarbons, construction infrastructure and electric power engineering.
Resumption of the work by our energy working group could provide a major impetus for energy cooperation. I hope we will discuss all these issues today.
President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation and for a warm welcome right from our arrival in Sochi Airport. I would like to thank you for your hospitality and for holding this meeting.
This was a wonderful event indeed. We would like to congratulate you on this success and also tell you that Equatorial Guinea signed two agreements during the First Russia-Africa Summit.
We think Russia must be the number one partner of Equatorial Guinea, although we cooperate with many countries, including Russia. We would like to develop economic cooperation on a large scale. This is why we signed two agreements – one with Lukoil in the oil and gas sector and the other with RosGeo in the geological sector. They will also work with Equatorial Guinea.
Of course, we would like to work with Russian companies. They could take part in the development of our state. Our country offers favourable conditions for foreign investment. So we would like to thank you for this meeting and urge Russian companies to invest in Equatorial Guinea.

Meeting with President of Rwanda Paul Kagame.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very glad to meet with you again. Last year you came to Russia, as I remember, to take part in the FIFA World Cup’s opening ceremony.
The opening of the Russia-Africa Summit coincided with your birthday, as we remember. I would like to once again wish you good health, prosperity and success, and thank you for coming to Russia regardless of this personal occasion of yours.

Today we have a good opportunity to discuss the current state and prospects of bilateral cooperation as well as to exchange opinions on topical African and international issues, including in the context of Rwanda’s current chairmanship in the East African Community.
Russia and Rwanda boast traditionally friendly relations. Last year we marked the 55th anniversary of our diplomatic ties.
Last year our trade grew by one third. The absolute numbers are not that big, but the trend is positive. It was adjusted in the first six months of this year, so, of course, additional efforts are needed to normalise the situation.
The participation of Rwandan representatives in the Russia-Africa Economic Forum should boost this process. We have renewed, stepped up our relations in an entire range of promising areas. I hope that we will get a chance to discuss some issues during our meeting today.
President of Rwanda Paul Kagame: Your Excellency, President,
I want to thank you for your very warm welcome and the important substance of the discussions we had today and remarks. Let me once again thank you most sincerely for including even personal wishes to me for my birthday. It was a good coincidence that I had it here in Russia, in Sochi, so it’s a great pleasure for me to be here.
And also I have good memories of our last meeting last year. And on that platform we have been able to build a good relationship between our two countries and look forward to continue the strengthening of that relationship and to personally develop that connection with you, Mr President. And in the context of the relationship Africa and Russia will develop.
I want to congratulate you and your government on the success of this historic first Russia-Africa Summit. We are very happy and satisfied with the results as they happened. Number of things were happening today. My own delegation was busy making connection with the Russian counterpart in different areas of interest. And we are happy that a number of milestones have been reached, even signing a number of agreements. So, President, we are very happy to be here, we are happy to be partners and friends with Russia, and we want to continue that. Thank you very much.
