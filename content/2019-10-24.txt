With President of Angola Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am glad to welcome you in Sochi again. And, of course, I have warm memories of our productive talks in Moscow in April, on April 4 of this year. We appreciate your participation in the first Russia-Africa Summit, which no doubt will be an important step in the development of the entire range of Russian-African ties.
Mr President,
Next year we will mark a significant anniversary: 45 years since the declaration of Angola’s independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.
Over this period, Angola has become Russia’s important partner in Africa. Our interstate ties are traditionally friendly in nature. We are promoting our practices in the trade, economic, investment and cultural areas and maintain an active political dialogue.

At our April talks in Moscow, we reaffirmed our mutual political will to develop bilateral cooperation with a view to making it a genuine strategic partnership. It was included in the joint communique signed at the end of your visit.
I think that now we should focus on implementing the agreements that we reached. Russian agencies, organisations and government corporations are already working on this. We expect that our Angolan friends have also started to put them into effect.
We are very glad to see you, Mr President, and I hope that our meeting today will also help strengthen our bilateral ties.
Thank you.
President of the Republic of Angola Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco (retranslated): Thank you very much, President Putin and the delegation that is accompanying you.
We came to Russia on a state visit in April, and today we are here not in a bilateral format but mostly to take part in the first Russia-Africa Summit, which is quite important for us.
Russia is a country that helped the African countries that fought for their national independence. That struggle was hard enough, it took us a long time, but eventually with your help we have all become independent, except Eastern Sahara, which is not in the best shape.
But today Africa is free, largely through the efforts of the Russian people, the efforts of the former Soviet Union. Africa is free through those efforts.
At present we are at a new stage. At this stage we want to count not only on your assistance, but also on cooperation between our countries. Such cooperation is already happening but has yet to reach the level that is possible.
There is great potential on both sides that we can reach. This is what we have wanted to do since April, the time of my first visit.
We know, Mr President, that your delegation has been trying for several days to hold this event. We are glad that you have found the time to meet with us.

With President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are very glad to see all of you in Sochi.
Mr President, this is not your first visit to Russia. I hope your stay in Sochi and participation in the Russia-Africa summit will leave you with the most positive impressions and will further promote relations between Russia and Equatorial Guinea.
We consider your country to be a promising partner for Russia. Our interstate cooperation is traditionally friendly. Last year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations.
We maintain continuous political dialogue. Recently we signed an agreement on cooperation between the upper houses of our parliaments. Our foreign ministries also stay in contact.

Mr President, we are grateful to you for your invariable support of a number of our initiatives at international venues, including the UN. This applies to the problems of glorifying Nazism. You voted for the draft resolutions on international information security and on not being the first to deploy weapons in space, to name a few.
I would like to note that, regrettably, indicators of our trade are still unstable. It is going up and down. I think we must improve this situation by joint efforts and make our cooperation more stable.
We believe we have the best prospects of cooperation in geological prospecting, joint mining and processing of hydrocarbons, construction infrastructure and electric power engineering.
Resumption of the work by our energy working group could provide a major impetus for energy cooperation. I hope we will discuss all these issues today.
President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation and for a warm welcome right from our arrival in Sochi Airport. I would like to thank you for your hospitality and for holding this meeting.
This was a wonderful event indeed. We would like to congratulate you on this success and also tell you that Equatorial Guinea signed two agreements during the First Russia-Africa Summit.
We think Russia must be the number one partner of Equatorial Guinea, although we cooperate with many countries, including Russia. We would like to develop economic cooperation on a large scale. This is why we signed two agreements – one with Lukoil in the oil and gas sector and the other with RosGeo in the geological sector. They will also work with Equatorial Guinea.
Of course, we would like to work with Russian companies. They could take part in the development of our state. Our country offers favourable conditions for foreign investment. So we would like to thank you for this meeting and urge Russian companies to invest in Equatorial Guinea.

Meeting with President of Rwanda Paul Kagame.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very glad to meet with you again. Last year you came to Russia, as I remember, to take part in the FIFA World Cup’s opening ceremony.
The opening of the Russia-Africa Summit coincided with your birthday, as we remember. I would like to once again wish you good health, prosperity and success, and thank you for coming to Russia regardless of this personal occasion of yours.

Today we have a good opportunity to discuss the current state and prospects of bilateral cooperation as well as to exchange opinions on topical African and international issues, including in the context of Rwanda’s current chairmanship in the East African Community.
Russia and Rwanda boast traditionally friendly relations. Last year we marked the 55th anniversary of our diplomatic ties.
Last year our trade grew by one third. The absolute numbers are not that big, but the trend is positive. It was adjusted in the first six months of this year, so, of course, additional efforts are needed to normalise the situation.
The participation of Rwandan representatives in the Russia-Africa Economic Forum should boost this process. We have renewed, stepped up our relations in an entire range of promising areas. I hope that we will get a chance to discuss some issues during our meeting today.
President of Rwanda Paul Kagame: Your Excellency, President,
I want to thank you for your very warm welcome and the important substance of the discussions we had today and remarks. Let me once again thank you most sincerely for including even personal wishes to me for my birthday. It was a good coincidence that I had it here in Russia, in Sochi, so it’s a great pleasure for me to be here.
And also I have good memories of our last meeting last year. And on that platform we have been able to build a good relationship between our two countries and look forward to continue the strengthening of that relationship and to personally develop that connection with you, Mr President. And in the context of the relationship Africa and Russia will develop.
I want to congratulate you and your government on the success of this historic first Russia-Africa Summit. We are very happy and satisfied with the results as they happened. Number of things were happening today. My own delegation was busy making connection with the Russian counterpart in different areas of interest. And we are happy that a number of milestones have been reached, even signing a number of agreements. So, President, we are very happy to be here, we are happy to be partners and friends with Russia, and we want to continue that. Thank you very much.

Meeting with President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta
Vladimir Putin met with President of the Republic of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta.

With President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
Thank you for coming here to work with us.
First of all, I would like to note that the history of friendly ties between Russia and Kenya goes back to the moment when Kenya gained independence, which was proclaimed by your father, Mr President, first President of Kenya Jomo Kenyatta.
And a day later, diplomatic ties were established, on December 12 and December 14, 1963, accordingly. I am sure that our meeting will give a boost to the further strengthening of Russian-Kenyan cooperation.
I remember my conversation with the Prime Minister of Kenya back in June 2012. Our countries’ parliaments also make their contribution to the development of bilateral ties. I hope that this cooperation between our parliaments will also continue and will create favourable conditions for the development of our relations. By the way, two Russian-Kenyan business forums were held at the parliamentarians’ initiative, in 2011 and 2012, which I think deserves our full support.

Of course, we believe the development of trade and economic ties and stable growth of mutual trade is the priority. Last year it grew only a little, but it was still 1.2 percent growth. We are glad that several Russian companies have gained a foothold in the Kenyan market.
I hope we will get a chance to discuss this in more detail today.
President of Kenya Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta: Thank you very much and let me once again say that, on my own behalf and on behalf of my delegation, we are very grateful to you, your government and the people of Russia for the very warm welcome that we have received since we arrived in this beautiful city. And, indeed, to also say that I am confident that this initiative that you started to host this first Russia-Africa economic forum and summit, I believe, will present not just Russia and Kenya but Russia and Africa with significant opportunities to really re-shape and expand our relations, both at the bilateral level, as I said, and multilateral level, but also to rekindle, in your own words, the historic relations between Russia and Africa.
Indeed, again as you’ve stated, Africa’s aspiration for freedom and liberty was greatly enriched by the relationship with Russia. Our founding fathers, including my own father Jomo Kenyatta, drew great vision from the Soviet Union, and for that we remain grateful. We wouldn’t have achieved what we achieved at that time without the support that we received from the Soviet Union, the then Soviet Union.
Your Excellency,
To preserve this history and heritage, indeed, one of the requests I want to put to you is we would like you to facilitate collation and retrieval of some of the information and material that may be here, in Russia, relating to the activities and the histories of Kenya’s freedom fighters, including that of Jomo Kenyatta. That is something that we would truly appreciate and, at some stage, would like to send some of our officials to work with your own historians and archivists to see what we can do to put that history together and preserve it for posterity.
Mr President, I also believe that this forum you have organised offers again, to Russia and Africa, the opportunity to focus on ways and means of expanding our political, economic, technical, cultural and educational interests in a manner that serves both our countries and promotes Russia’s partnership with the African Union.

Closing remarks at the plenary session of the Russia-Africa Summit
October 24, 2019
17:00
Sochi
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr el-Sisi, delegation heads, ladies and gentlemen. We are concluding our discussion. I would like to say a few words in this connection.
The Prime Minister of Tanzania, who was speaking just now, told us about his country’s advantages and landmarks, including Kilimanjaro. I would like to tell you that Russia knows about the snows of Kilimanjaro and the country’s attractions not only from the best literary works, such as the books of Ernest Hemingway.

We know Africa very well, and we have known it for a long time. We know that its main resource is its talented people. Of course, it also has rich natural resources, and the African leaders, who are our friends, and the African people in general want to move forward and to do this as speedily as possible.
But we are also aware of the host of problems facing Africa that need to be settled. Our discussion has shown that we have similar or identical views when it comes to the majority of current global and regional problems. Our countries are interested in the progressive development of Russian-African relations in all spheres. We are ready to continue working together to strengthen our mutually beneficial cooperation.
Much has been said here about the role of the Soviet Union and Russia in the development of independent African countries. We are sincerely grateful to you for your historical memory. This is very important to us. At the same time, it should be said that the Soviet Union’s actions were largely inspired by ideological considerations or the logic of global geopolitical fighting.
Many speakers here mentioned a new stage and new quality of relations between Russia and Africa. I fully agree with this. This new stage and this new quality of our relations should be based on common values. We are at one in our support for the values of justice, equality and respect for the rights of nations to independently choose their future. It is within this framework that we will continue to coordinate our positions at international platforms and our joint efforts in the interests of stability on the African continent.
Very useful ideas and proposals have been expressed today regarding more intensive contacts in politics and security, in trade and investment, industrial cooperation, science and high technologies, education and healthcare.
The drafted final declaration of the summit outlines the fundamental approaches of Russia and African states to the development of relations; it determines the main goals and objectives for strengthening partnerships, as well as ways to achieve them. I take it that we all focus on making our cooperation more systematic and integrated. My colleagues also spoke about this here, both yesterday and today.
To this end, a dialogue platform is being created at some of our African friends’ proposals – a Russia-Africa partnership forum. On that platform, we can hold Russia-Africa summits every three years, alternately in our country or in one of the African states.
Current issues regarding the Russian-African cooperation agenda will be considered at annual consultations between foreign ministers of Russia and three African countries including the current, previous and future presidents of the African Union.
I hope that relations between Russia and African countries will indeed ascend to a new qualitative level, which will undoubtedly meet the interests of each participant in today's summit.
To wind up, I would like to thank President el-Sisi for his support. Without exaggeration, I would like to say that, had it not been for the support of our Egyptian friends, today's summit would have probably never got off the ground – not in the format we are now working in anyway. Among other things, as you can see, he has been here by my side and giving me a helping hand all through the day. I will have to share my salary with him now because he did part of my job. Thank you very much! (Laughter.)
I would like to thank all of you, colleagues, because I am sure you are responsible for this absolutely unique atmosphere. It definitely took a lot of time, and everyone had to speak out and state their opinion on how and what we need to do to enhance cooperation. But still, I think this is a unique atmosphere we have created, very friendly, a friendly atmosphere of free discussions, which, in my opinion, is also of great value.
I would like to thank you all. If you agree with what I said, I hope we will continue our joint work in approximately the same vein. We will start improving our interaction.
Thank you all so much and see you again.

This year the head of the counter-terrorism unit took part in the 10th international meeting of high representatives that are in charge of these activities. At today’s two sessions, we spoke at length about fighting terrorism, and I believe such cooperation between our secret services is very important for everyone.
We are grateful to your country for its active work with the Russian Foreign Ministry at international venues, and we certainly welcome Mauritius’ active role in African affairs.
We have issues linked with our business interests, for instance, in fishing. We also have other common interests.
I am very delighted to speak with you on the sidelines of our forum today.
Acting President of Mauritius Paramasivum Vyapoory: Thank you very much, President. Concerning terrorism, we have to inform you that we have voted laws, we have the Prevention of Terrorism Act, so we are very conscious of the dangers and we are putting in place all control measures.
I would come back to some of the main issues that I raised earlier today. First, of course, thank you for welcoming us to this beautiful city of Sochi to attend this great summit. We mentioned this earlier today that we appreciate the support of Russia in our claim for our sovereignty on Chagos, but it’s not over yet. The UK has been given a deadline up till 22nd of November to leave the territory, so that we, Mauritians, can get back its territory. We appreciate that Russia’s regard for the rule of law.

Last year, we marked the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Let me remind you that the Soviet Union was one of the first countries to recognise the young Republic of Guinea – literally two days after your country declared its independence.
The Soviet Union helped to create a powerful bauxite mining complex in Guinea, renovate railways, and build a road network, a university in the capital, an airport, and a number of other facilities.
At the present stage, too, our countries enjoy a close partnership. Bilateral cooperation noticeably intensified after your official visit to Russia in September 2017, Mr President.
I am satisfied to note that trade is growing: in 2018, it grew by more than seven times, and in January–July of this year, it grew by another 2.5 times. And we can only be happy about this trend. It is necessary to make this consistent with our capabilities in absolute figures.
President of the Republic of Guinea Alpha Condé (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. I am very pleased to meet with you – this is the second time today. As I said to Sergei Lavrov, you are always a friendly country to us, whatever our political flags and banners may be. Since the times of the Soviet Union, you have been alongside us, protecting us.
However, I would like, if possible, to spend most of our meeting in a one-on-one format, because I have things to say that are not worth discussing with so many people.
Vladimir Putin: My pleasure.

I am delighted to meet with you and the delegation on the sidelines of today's event.
We attach great importance to developing an interstate strategic partnership with the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, which is based on strong traditions of a long-standing – I want to emphasise this – long-standing friendship and mutual respect.
The political dialogue is continuing uninterrupted. We remain in constant contact and are coordinating our efforts both bilaterally and at international platforms.

Algeria is one of Russia’s leading trade and economic partners in Africa and the Arab world. In 2018, trade grew by 4 percent to almost $5 billion. A mixed intergovernmental commission for trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation is operational.
We are aware that major political events are taking place in Algeria. We sincerely wish success to the Algerian people in overcoming the current difficult transitional period.
We are confident that things will ultimately turn out well, and the Algerian people will benefit from it and will strengthen its statehood and sovereignty. All we can do for you, we will do, on the basis of traditional friendship and trust, which, I think, is extremely important in relations between states.
Once again, welcome to Russia and thank you for accepting our invitation and coming to the first ever Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi.
Head of State of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria Abdelkader Bensalah (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President,
I would like to thank you for the invitation and to congratulate you on the initiative to host such an event, as well as congratulate you on organising it well and gathering all African countries, all representatives of our continent, with the Russian leaders. We believe this is a very good time for the meeting, and we have thus proved the importance of the future development of relations between Russia and African countries.
With regard to bilateral relations, I, in turn, also see a very good level of relations across all areas. Hopefully, these relations will expand even more. I think that the intergovernmental commission has already identified specific areas, and we should strive to move forward.
Mr President,
I asked for a meeting with you and my main goal is to reassure you that the situation in Algeria is stable and we are in control of it, and we can, as a nation, move forward in the right direction. Of course, the media sometimes exaggerate the events unfolding in Algeria, and sometimes deliberately distort the actual situation
However, we can assure you that we have already drawn up a general plan and have almost completed its implementation. We, alongside the members of the Algerian public, have set up a free committee: the presidential administration and military institutions cannot influence it in any way, and it will have the main plan for organising elections on December 12.

Press statements by presidents of Russia and Egypt following Russia–Africa Summit

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President el-Sisi, ladies and gentlemen,
The first Russia-Africa Summit is over. Summing up its work over the two days, we can say that this event opened up a new page in the history of Russia’s relations with African countries. This was a business meeting but at the same time it was very friendly, if not cordial, and this created a special atmosphere for our discussions.
Delegations of all African countries without exception arrived in Sochi. Over forty states were represented by top officials. The summit was preceded by a representative economic forum. Many multilateral and bilateral contacts took place at the top and other levels. Most important, they were held at the business level.
The results of the joint efforts are reflected in the final declaration. This document sets goals and tasks for the further development of Russia-Africa cooperation in all areas: politics, security, the economy, science, technology, culture and humanitarian sphere.

Russia-Africa Summit
October 24, 2019
To ensure that our cooperation is regular and consistent, the forum made a decision at the initiative of our African friends to create a new dialogue mechanism – the Russia-Africa partnership forum.
Top-level meetings will take place within its framework once every three years, held alternately in Russia and in an African state. The forum will also provide for annual consultations between the foreign ministers of Russia and three African countries: the current, future and previous chairpersons of the African Union.
Russia-Africa relations are based on long-standing traditions of friendship and solidarity formed back when our country supported the struggle of the peoples of Africa against colonialism, racism and apartheid, protected their independence and sovereignty, and helped establish statehood, build the foundations of the national economy and create combat-ready national armed forces.
Our specialists have built major infrastructure facilities, including hydroelectric power plants, roads and industrial enterprises. Thousands of Africans have received high-quality professional training in our country.
Expanding and simplifying mutually beneficial ties with African states are among Russia’s foreign policy priorities. We are constructively working together at the UN and its regional sector-specific institutions.
Our countries’ positions on important issues on the international agenda are close or similar. We are grateful to our African partners for supporting resolutions of prime importance for us, such as resolutions on combating the glorification of Nazism, on the non-deployment of weapons in space first, on confidence-building measures in outer space, and on international information security.
As a permanent member of the United Nations, Russia stands with the countries of Africa on matters of strengthening peace and stability on the continent and ensuring regional security.

We are also striving to establish cooperation with African integration associations. Prospects for cooperation between the integration associations of Africa and the Eurasian Economic Union were discussed at a meeting between the heads of regional African organisations and the Eurasian Economic Commission Board chairman.
As you have just seen, a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the Eurasian Economic Commission and the African Union Commission. We plan to expand trade and economic cooperation.
The economic forum, which, as you are aware, took place yesterday, was devoted to this. The discussions and presentations by key Russian companies, as well as specific sessions focusing on particular areas of cooperation have shown that Russian and African business circles are interested in expanding mutually beneficial ties.
Ladies and gentlemen,
You understand that when we established relations back in the times of the Soviet Union, it was done according to the existing state blueprints. It was good, but it is hard to imagine this today.
Today we need more information about each other’s capacities; it is necessary that all the participants in the economic processes keep track of the latest events and African countries’ capabilities and competitive strengths on global markets. It is impossible to do without events like the one we held yesterday. All the necessary conditions have been created for such work.
Last year Russia’s trade with African states grew more than 17 percent and exceeded $20 billion, which we mentioned many times yesterday and today. We believe that we can bring it to higher levels and reach at least $40 billion.
Energy is an important area of economic cooperation. Joint projects are implemented in traditional sectors such as hydrocarbon production, construction and repair of power generation facilities as well as in peaceful nuclear energy and the use of renewable energy sources.
Russian companies are ready to work with their African partners to upgrade transport infrastructure, develop telecommunications and digital technologies, provide information security, and they offer the most advanced technologies and engineering solutions.
And, of course, Russia will continue its traditional training of highly qualified national experts for all branches of the economy of the African states. I was very glad today when a participant in our discussion spoke in Russian, with almost no accent.
Let me remind you that over 100 educational institutions have been built in Africa with the support of our country. Approximately 500,000 Africans completed training. Of these, about 100,000 people received diplomas from Soviet and Russian universities, and 250,000 studied at joint educational centres in the African countries themselves. Another 150,000 specialists were trained during the construction and operation of large industrial enterprises built with our participation.
Russia will further assist African countries in developing national healthcare, ensuring broad access for all segments of the population to qualified medical care, and strengthening Africa’s capacity to combat epidemics.
And I want to emphasise that such work is absolutely mutually beneficial, since it also gives Russian companies the opportunity to work in the African market, interact with African partners and receive appropriate benefits in the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the current Chairperson of the African Union, President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and all our Egyptian friends; there are many of them, we all know them well; they played a direct, practical role in the preparation of yesterday’s and today’s events.
I would like to thank them for their active participation in this work and the holding of the summit. And of course, I would like to express gratitude to all African colleagues participating in the summit for the fruitful joint work.
I am sure that the implementation of the plans and initiatives agreed upon during the summit will help bring Russian-African cooperation to a qualitatively new level.
Thank you for your attention.
President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
, Chairperson of the African Union and co-chair of the Russia-Africa Summit (retranslated): President Putin, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to express gratitude to all of you, but especially to President Putin, for your hospitality and warmth during the summit. I greatly appreciate the efforts you have made to ensure its success, as well as the spirit of cooperation displayed by the leaders of the African countries and the heads of the AU delegations who attended this summit. This helped us to coordinate a final communique, which reflects the common priorities of Russia and the African countries and the sides’ approach to many international matters, primarily peace, security and sustainable development in keeping with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The Russia-Africa Summit is aimed at formalising a higher level of cooperation between the sides and their political will and desire to strengthen relations in all spheres in the interests of our goals – peace, stability and sustainable development.
The Russia-Africa Economic Forum, which was held yesterday, was a success for all its participants, because it boosted interaction between various economic partners. It was attended by the business elite from Russia and Africa.
The forum focused on priority issues for the African continent, primarily infrastructure, industry, agriculture, healthcare, energy and the application of modern technology.
These goals were achieved through discussion of the three main themes of the forum: ways to promote economic relations, the encouragement of joint projects, and humanitarian and cultural cooperation.
The forum provided a venue for direct dialogue between representatives of the public and private sectors of various countries, which has added a new dimension to Russian-African relations by helping to attract Russian businesses to the main economic sectors of African countries.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The open expression of Russian and African views on many issues of mutual interest, above all the development of political, economic, trade, scientific, technological and humanitarian relations, accelerated our movement towards our goals. It has also helped the heads of state and government from Africa and Russia to adopt a final declaration that reflects the principles coordinated by the sides, the most important of which are respect for international law and the UN Charter, the movement towards peace and security through the creation of more equal and fair international relations and a world order based on the principles of multilateralism, respect for national sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the peaceful settlement of crises, as well as the protection of national identity and civilisational and cultural pluralism.
Our declaration has reaffirmed the goals of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We have approved a ministerial mechanism for promoting dialogue and partnership. We appreciate all these moves and believe that they have created a solid foundation for the further development of Russian-African relations.
Aware of our common responsibility, the Russian and African sides will continue coordinating their efforts to monitor the implementation of the documents adopted at the summit, because this meets the desires and aspirations of African nations and the friendly Russian Federation.
All of us are responsible for working constructively on the basis of our achievements and for joining efforts to consolidate the results of the first Russia-Africa Summit in order to meet the aspirations of the African continent and African nations as fully as possible, as well as the aspirations of our compatriots outside Africa who closely followed the summit hoping for positive results, which they believe will help us to materialise the desires and hopes of the rising generations.
Thank you.
Peace and mercy and blessings of Allah be upon you.
