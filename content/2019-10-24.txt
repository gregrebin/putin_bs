With President of Angola Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am glad to welcome you in Sochi again. And, of course, I have warm memories of our productive talks in Moscow in April, on April 4 of this year. We appreciate your participation in the first Russia-Africa Summit, which no doubt will be an important step in the development of the entire range of Russian-African ties.
Mr President,
Next year we will mark a significant anniversary: 45 years since the declaration of Angola’s independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.
Over this period, Angola has become Russia’s important partner in Africa. Our interstate ties are traditionally friendly in nature. We are promoting our practices in the trade, economic, investment and cultural areas and maintain an active political dialogue.

At our April talks in Moscow, we reaffirmed our mutual political will to develop bilateral cooperation with a view to making it a genuine strategic partnership. It was included in the joint communique signed at the end of your visit.
I think that now we should focus on implementing the agreements that we reached. Russian agencies, organisations and government corporations are already working on this. We expect that our Angolan friends have also started to put them into effect.
We are very glad to see you, Mr President, and I hope that our meeting today will also help strengthen our bilateral ties.
Thank you.
President of the Republic of Angola Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco (retranslated): Thank you very much, President Putin and the delegation that is accompanying you.
We came to Russia on a state visit in April, and today we are here not in a bilateral format but mostly to take part in the first Russia-Africa Summit, which is quite important for us.
Russia is a country that helped the African countries that fought for their national independence. That struggle was hard enough, it took us a long time, but eventually with your help we have all become independent, except Eastern Sahara, which is not in the best shape.
But today Africa is free, largely through the efforts of the Russian people, the efforts of the former Soviet Union. Africa is free through those efforts.
At present we are at a new stage. At this stage we want to count not only on your assistance, but also on cooperation between our countries. Such cooperation is already happening but has yet to reach the level that is possible.
There is great potential on both sides that we can reach. This is what we have wanted to do since April, the time of my first visit.
We know, Mr President, that your delegation has been trying for several days to hold this event. We are glad that you have found the time to meet with us.

With President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are very glad to see all of you in Sochi.
Mr President, this is not your first visit to Russia. I hope your stay in Sochi and participation in the Russia-Africa summit will leave you with the most positive impressions and will further promote relations between Russia and Equatorial Guinea.
We consider your country to be a promising partner for Russia. Our interstate cooperation is traditionally friendly. Last year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations.
We maintain continuous political dialogue. Recently we signed an agreement on cooperation between the upper houses of our parliaments. Our foreign ministries also stay in contact.

Mr President, we are grateful to you for your invariable support of a number of our initiatives at international venues, including the UN. This applies to the problems of glorifying Nazism. You voted for the draft resolutions on international information security and on not being the first to deploy weapons in space, to name a few.
I would like to note that, regrettably, indicators of our trade are still unstable. It is going up and down. I think we must improve this situation by joint efforts and make our cooperation more stable.
We believe we have the best prospects of cooperation in geological prospecting, joint mining and processing of hydrocarbons, construction infrastructure and electric power engineering.
Resumption of the work by our energy working group could provide a major impetus for energy cooperation. I hope we will discuss all these issues today.
President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation and for a warm welcome right from our arrival in Sochi Airport. I would like to thank you for your hospitality and for holding this meeting.
This was a wonderful event indeed. We would like to congratulate you on this success and also tell you that Equatorial Guinea signed two agreements during the First Russia-Africa Summit.
We think Russia must be the number one partner of Equatorial Guinea, although we cooperate with many countries, including Russia. We would like to develop economic cooperation on a large scale. This is why we signed two agreements – one with Lukoil in the oil and gas sector and the other with RosGeo in the geological sector. They will also work with Equatorial Guinea.
Of course, we would like to work with Russian companies. They could take part in the development of our state. Our country offers favourable conditions for foreign investment. So we would like to thank you for this meeting and urge Russian companies to invest in Equatorial Guinea.

Meeting with President of Rwanda Paul Kagame.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very glad to meet with you again. Last year you came to Russia, as I remember, to take part in the FIFA World Cup’s opening ceremony.
The opening of the Russia-Africa Summit coincided with your birthday, as we remember. I would like to once again wish you good health, prosperity and success, and thank you for coming to Russia regardless of this personal occasion of yours.

Today we have a good opportunity to discuss the current state and prospects of bilateral cooperation as well as to exchange opinions on topical African and international issues, including in the context of Rwanda’s current chairmanship in the East African Community.
Russia and Rwanda boast traditionally friendly relations. Last year we marked the 55th anniversary of our diplomatic ties.
Last year our trade grew by one third. The absolute numbers are not that big, but the trend is positive. It was adjusted in the first six months of this year, so, of course, additional efforts are needed to normalise the situation.
The participation of Rwandan representatives in the Russia-Africa Economic Forum should boost this process. We have renewed, stepped up our relations in an entire range of promising areas. I hope that we will get a chance to discuss some issues during our meeting today.
President of Rwanda Paul Kagame: Your Excellency, President,
I want to thank you for your very warm welcome and the important substance of the discussions we had today and remarks. Let me once again thank you most sincerely for including even personal wishes to me for my birthday. It was a good coincidence that I had it here in Russia, in Sochi, so it’s a great pleasure for me to be here.
And also I have good memories of our last meeting last year. And on that platform we have been able to build a good relationship between our two countries and look forward to continue the strengthening of that relationship and to personally develop that connection with you, Mr President. And in the context of the relationship Africa and Russia will develop.
I want to congratulate you and your government on the success of this historic first Russia-Africa Summit. We are very happy and satisfied with the results as they happened. Number of things were happening today. My own delegation was busy making connection with the Russian counterpart in different areas of interest. And we are happy that a number of milestones have been reached, even signing a number of agreements. So, President, we are very happy to be here, we are happy to be partners and friends with Russia, and we want to continue that. Thank you very much.

Meeting with President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta
Vladimir Putin met with President of the Republic of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta.

With President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
Thank you for coming here to work with us.
First of all, I would like to note that the history of friendly ties between Russia and Kenya goes back to the moment when Kenya gained independence, which was proclaimed by your father, Mr President, first President of Kenya Jomo Kenyatta.
And a day later, diplomatic ties were established, on December 12 and December 14, 1963, accordingly. I am sure that our meeting will give a boost to the further strengthening of Russian-Kenyan cooperation.
I remember my conversation with the Prime Minister of Kenya back in June 2012. Our countries’ parliaments also make their contribution to the development of bilateral ties. I hope that this cooperation between our parliaments will also continue and will create favourable conditions for the development of our relations. By the way, two Russian-Kenyan business forums were held at the parliamentarians’ initiative, in 2011 and 2012, which I think deserves our full support.

Of course, we believe the development of trade and economic ties and stable growth of mutual trade is the priority. Last year it grew only a little, but it was still 1.2 percent growth. We are glad that several Russian companies have gained a foothold in the Kenyan market.
I hope we will get a chance to discuss this in more detail today.
President of Kenya Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta: Thank you very much and let me once again say that, on my own behalf and on behalf of my delegation, we are very grateful to you, your government and the people of Russia for the very warm welcome that we have received since we arrived in this beautiful city. And, indeed, to also say that I am confident that this initiative that you started to host this first Russia-Africa economic forum and summit, I believe, will present not just Russia and Kenya but Russia and Africa with significant opportunities to really re-shape and expand our relations, both at the bilateral level, as I said, and multilateral level, but also to rekindle, in your own words, the historic relations between Russia and Africa.
Indeed, again as you’ve stated, Africa’s aspiration for freedom and liberty was greatly enriched by the relationship with Russia. Our founding fathers, including my own father Jomo Kenyatta, drew great vision from the Soviet Union, and for that we remain grateful. We wouldn’t have achieved what we achieved at that time without the support that we received from the Soviet Union, the then Soviet Union.
Your Excellency,
To preserve this history and heritage, indeed, one of the requests I want to put to you is we would like you to facilitate collation and retrieval of some of the information and material that may be here, in Russia, relating to the activities and the histories of Kenya’s freedom fighters, including that of Jomo Kenyatta. That is something that we would truly appreciate and, at some stage, would like to send some of our officials to work with your own historians and archivists to see what we can do to put that history together and preserve it for posterity.
Mr President, I also believe that this forum you have organised offers again, to Russia and Africa, the opportunity to focus on ways and means of expanding our political, economic, technical, cultural and educational interests in a manner that serves both our countries and promotes Russia’s partnership with the African Union.

Closing remarks at the plenary session of the Russia-Africa Summit
October 24, 2019
17:00
Sochi
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr el-Sisi, delegation heads, ladies and gentlemen. We are concluding our discussion. I would like to say a few words in this connection.
The Prime Minister of Tanzania, who was speaking just now, told us about his country’s advantages and landmarks, including Kilimanjaro. I would like to tell you that Russia knows about the snows of Kilimanjaro and the country’s attractions not only from the best literary works, such as the books of Ernest Hemingway.

We know Africa very well, and we have known it for a long time. We know that its main resource is its talented people. Of course, it also has rich natural resources, and the African leaders, who are our friends, and the African people in general want to move forward and to do this as speedily as possible.
But we are also aware of the host of problems facing Africa that need to be settled. Our discussion has shown that we have similar or identical views when it comes to the majority of current global and regional problems. Our countries are interested in the progressive development of Russian-African relations in all spheres. We are ready to continue working together to strengthen our mutually beneficial cooperation.
Much has been said here about the role of the Soviet Union and Russia in the development of independent African countries. We are sincerely grateful to you for your historical memory. This is very important to us. At the same time, it should be said that the Soviet Union’s actions were largely inspired by ideological considerations or the logic of global geopolitical fighting.
Many speakers here mentioned a new stage and new quality of relations between Russia and Africa. I fully agree with this. This new stage and this new quality of our relations should be based on common values. We are at one in our support for the values of justice, equality and respect for the rights of nations to independently choose their future. It is within this framework that we will continue to coordinate our positions at international platforms and our joint efforts in the interests of stability on the African continent.
Very useful ideas and proposals have been expressed today regarding more intensive contacts in politics and security, in trade and investment, industrial cooperation, science and high technologies, education and healthcare.
The drafted final declaration of the summit outlines the fundamental approaches of Russia and African states to the development of relations; it determines the main goals and objectives for strengthening partnerships, as well as ways to achieve them. I take it that we all focus on making our cooperation more systematic and integrated. My colleagues also spoke about this here, both yesterday and today.
To this end, a dialogue platform is being created at some of our African friends’ proposals – a Russia-Africa partnership forum. On that platform, we can hold Russia-Africa summits every three years, alternately in our country or in one of the African states.
Current issues regarding the Russian-African cooperation agenda will be considered at annual consultations between foreign ministers of Russia and three African countries including the current, previous and future presidents of the African Union.
I hope that relations between Russia and African countries will indeed ascend to a new qualitative level, which will undoubtedly meet the interests of each participant in today's summit.
To wind up, I would like to thank President el-Sisi for his support. Without exaggeration, I would like to say that, had it not been for the support of our Egyptian friends, today's summit would have probably never got off the ground – not in the format we are now working in anyway. Among other things, as you can see, he has been here by my side and giving me a helping hand all through the day. I will have to share my salary with him now because he did part of my job. Thank you very much! (Laughter.)
I would like to thank all of you, colleagues, because I am sure you are responsible for this absolutely unique atmosphere. It definitely took a lot of time, and everyone had to speak out and state their opinion on how and what we need to do to enhance cooperation. But still, I think this is a unique atmosphere we have created, very friendly, a friendly atmosphere of free discussions, which, in my opinion, is also of great value.
I would like to thank you all. If you agree with what I said, I hope we will continue our joint work in approximately the same vein. We will start improving our interaction.
Thank you all so much and see you again.

This year the head of the counter-terrorism unit took part in the 10th international meeting of high representatives that are in charge of these activities. At today’s two sessions, we spoke at length about fighting terrorism, and I believe such cooperation between our secret services is very important for everyone.
We are grateful to your country for its active work with the Russian Foreign Ministry at international venues, and we certainly welcome Mauritius’ active role in African affairs.
We have issues linked with our business interests, for instance, in fishing. We also have other common interests.
I am very delighted to speak with you on the sidelines of our forum today.
Acting President of Mauritius Paramasivum Vyapoory: Thank you very much, President. Concerning terrorism, we have to inform you that we have voted laws, we have the Prevention of Terrorism Act, so we are very conscious of the dangers and we are putting in place all control measures.
I would come back to some of the main issues that I raised earlier today. First, of course, thank you for welcoming us to this beautiful city of Sochi to attend this great summit. We mentioned this earlier today that we appreciate the support of Russia in our claim for our sovereignty on Chagos, but it’s not over yet. The UK has been given a deadline up till 22nd of November to leave the territory, so that we, Mauritians, can get back its territory. We appreciate that Russia’s regard for the rule of law.
