Speech at hospice opening.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Beatitude, Prince Ghazi, friends,
I am happy to welcome everyone taking part in the opening of the Russian hospice located next to one of the most important Christian shrines: the Baptism Site of Jesus Christ.
I would like to thank King Abdullah II of Jordan, who not only gave the Russian Federation a plot of land for this significant project, but fully supported it as well. Our Jordanian friends have done everything possible so that our builders can erect a Russian mission here. And we know how important it is for thousands of pilgrims who come to these places every year. Russians have been visiting these sites since the 13th century. Preserving such shrines brings people closer together and serves our common high moral values.
The Middle East is known as a crossroads of world religions and has known different periods in its history, including some dramatic ones. But the traditions of mutual understanding, mutual enrichment of cultures and customs, have always been strong here.
Everyone is aware of the role played by Jordan and King Abdullah II: in 2005, the Amman Message was adopted, which became an important tool in settling disagreements within Islam. These ideas – ideas of mutual respect and dialogue – are becoming even more popular today, here in the Middle East and throughout the world. The history of Russia, which spans more than a thousand years, also speaks to this; it was created through the efforts and care of people from different ethnic backgrounds and faiths.
I am certain that peace, harmony and mutual understanding will always prevail here at this hospice, in this home for pilgrims. It will always be open to all who cross its threshold with good intentions.
Thank you.

Vladimir Putin answered Russian journalists’ questions
June 26, 2012
Later, Mr Putin and King Abdullah II took part in the opening of a hospice for Russian pilgrims on the territory of a special archaeological site known as the Baptism Site of Jesus Christ on the Jordan River.
The construction of the hospice began at Mr Putin’s initiative after King Abdullah II gave to the Russian Federation a 1-hectare plot of land for free and perpetual use in 2006. Russia gained the right of ownership to the land in 2012.
The President decorated Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, chief religious and cultural adviser and personal envoy to King Abdullah II, with the Order of Friendship for his big contribution to strengthening the friendship and cooperation between Russia and Jordan.

King Abdullah II of Jordan
(retranslated): Mr President, I would like to welcome you here, to use this opportunity to welcome you on behalf of our entire delegation.
Russia and Jordan have always been bound by good, friendly relations, and your visit here at the beginning of your presidential term once again confirms the special nature of the relations between our two states. Today, you will also participate in the opening of a guesthouse for Russian pilgrims. The land for this building was granted by the Government of Jordan; this is another gesture of our good relations, which will continue to strengthen thanks to your visit.
I hope that your visit will also allow us to strengthen economic and social relations. On the political level, we have always had very good relations. I would like to thank you for coming and express my hope that we will have very fruitful talks.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, friends,
It is a real pleasure for me to be in Jordan again, especially for such a pleasant reason as the opening of the guesthouse for pilgrims. In this regard, I would like to thank you, Your Majesty, for this generous gesture, for assigning to the Russian Federation a stretch of land to build the guesthouse. We view it as a gesture of the particular relations between Jordan and Russia.
Five or six years ago, I met here with Prince Ghazi and it was he who suggested that we build this centre here, which we will be opening today. I recall how impressed I was by his stories about Jordan, and I also remember how he talked about your country, about world history. It was certainly very descriptive, very interesting, and it was then that we decided to build this house.
Your Majesty, we are satisfied with the level of our political dialogue. A great deal can and should still be done in our economic relations. I am very happy for the opportunity to meet with you within the framework of this humanitarian event, to talk about the situation in the region and to compare notes on currently critical regions and hot spots.
We have always approached Jordan’s position with a great attention and respect. We have established very friendly relations. We will do everything possible to further develop them in the future.
Thank you.

Statements for the press following Russian-Palestinian talks

Statements for the press following Russian-Palestinian talks.
President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas (retranslated): Your Excellency, dear friend and our guest who is close to the heart of every Palestinian!
We are happy to welcome you here in Bethlehem, the ancient land of Jesus Christ’s birth, one of the world’s most important historical and spiritual centres along with Jerusalem, the place of Prophet Mohammed’s ascension.
We would like to thank the entire Russian nation, which you represent here, for the comprehensive and multi-faceted assistance it provides to the Palestinian people in their just struggle.
Russia has always provided such support and assistance to the Palestinian people at all stages of their struggle to bring to reality their national aspirations associated with the creation of an independent Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem. Moreover, we are united by unbreakable cultural, spiritual, religious and other bonds. One example of this is the celebration of the 130th anniversary of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society. Last year, a museum and park complex opened here on Palestinian soil, in Jericho, the oldest city in the world. Today we have the honour to accompany your Excellency to the opening ceremony of the Russian Centre for Science and Culture in Bethlehem.
Today the President of Russia and I discussed a number of issues of mutual interest, especially the future development of bilateral Palestinian-Russian relations. We also discussed in detail the situation evolving in the peace process, including Israel’s settlement activities, which are the main obstacle on the path to peace.
We asked His Excellency for assistance in the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons since 1994. Relevant arrangements and agreements with the Israeli side are in place, but unfortunately they are not being executed.
We have confirmed to Mr President that the only way to achieve peace in the region is through negotiations with Israel. We also reiterated today the need for a peace conference in Moscow on the Middle East, as had been agreed some time ago.
We have also discussed the domestic situation in the Palestinian territories and inter-Palestinian reconciliation. I have confirmed to His Excellency that if the timing of presidential and parliamentary elections is determined, we will be able to tackle the reconciliation issue.
Today we also discussed the situation developing in many Arab countries in the light of the Arab Spring events; we stated our position in great detail because we know that our views are of interest for Russia. Events in Arab countries are also of vital importance to us.
Once again, we are happy to welcome Mr President, our dear friend and a person close to every Palestinian heart. We also welcome the delegation accompanying you.
We wish you every success and would like to take this opportunity to express our deep respect to you personally, the friendly Russian people and the friendly Russian Government. We are very glad to see you on Palestinian soil and we hope that your visit to the independent state of Palestine is not in the too distant future.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
First of all I would like to thank our friend President Abbas for his invitation to visit Palestine.
We have just completed our talks with the President of the Palestinian National Authority [Mahmoud Abbas]. I would like to note that the talks were both constructive and informative.
We discussed the situation in the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue and in the Middle East in general. We talked about the region’s problem areas and the prospects of our bilateral cooperation in a wide range of fields.
It is important that we can rely on time-tested traditions as we build our plans for the future. Continuity is one of the key preconditions for the sustained development of bilateral relations.
For example, for Russia there is no problem in recognising an independent Palestinian state. This was done 25 years ago by the Soviet Union, and Russia, as we know, is the Soviet Union’s successor and its position on this matter has not changed. In this regard, I want to emphasise that our discussion on all the issues on our agenda today was very open and constructive.
Our humanitarian contacts are expanding. As you have heard already, the Russian Centre for Science and Culture has opened today in Bethlehem.
I would like to thank our dear friend Mr Abbas for his continued support of the Russian presence in the Holy Land and for effective assistance in the implementation of such projects. I am sure that the centre will help to expand our cooperation in the humanitarian, cultural, scientific and educational spheres, and in the field of youth exchanges.
One example of an excellent tradition of our cooperation remains the special quota for scholarships paid out of the federal budget for Palestinian students studying at Russian Universities.
We should give additional impetus to trade and economic relations. I hope the Business Council for Cooperation with Palestine and the Palestinian-Russian Business Council will play an important role here.
Undoubtedly, we will continue our political dialogue. Our positions are very close or practically identical on all key regional and global issues.
We have discussed in detail the ways of overcoming the crisis in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. I note here the responsible position of the Palestinian leadership and President Mahmoud Abbas, their commitment to a peaceful settlement based on international law and the two-state principle.
I am convinced that any unilateral actions taken before the final reconciliation is reached would be counterproductive. It is essential to exercise the utmost restraint and strictly adhere to the commitments taken on earlier. In addition, the speedy restoration of political unity in Palestine on the platform of the Palestine Liberation Organisation will also contribute to the resolution of the conflict.
We believe that efforts on all these issues are certain to bring about positive results and contribute to stabilising the situation in the Middle East.
In conclusion, I would like to stress once again that we appreciate the readiness of Palestine, the Palestinian people and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to develop a close partnership and friendly relations with Russia. For our part, we will do everything in our power to build up mutually beneficial cooperation.
I would like to thank the Palestinian leadership and President Abbas for today's meeting.
Thank you.

Question: Mr President, you discussed the topic of Syria with many leaders recently, and now you are literally an hour’s drive from Syria. What is your outlook? My second question concerns the upcoming international conference on Syria. The US has stated that it does not want to talk with Iran on this matter. Do you feel it would be possible to discuss this issue, and settle this problem overall, without Iran?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I think that the more of Syria’s neighbours are involved in the settlement process the better. Why? Because almost every neighbouring nation affects some part of the process. I feel that ignoring those opportunities, those interests, would be counterproductive, as diplomats like to say. In any case, this would complicate the process. We have cooperated with Iran on Afghanistan and we are still cooperating on certain other issues. And this should have nothing to do with the problems pertaining to Iran’s nuclear programme; that is a separate topic. Thus, in my view, it would be better to involve Iran in this process and secure its support. It would be better if the people inside Syria itself were able to agree with one another, and if all its neighbouring nations – all who can influence the situation – were to act as the guarantors of these agreements.
Question: Mr President, President of Israel Shimon Peres devoted most of yesterday’s reception to the topic of Iran. Do you share his point of view that Iran represents a direct threat to Israel’s existence as a state, or could present that threat in the foreseeable future?
Vladimir Putin: Mr Peres is certainly among the most experienced, established politicians in the world. Not just in terms of age, but in terms of experience, first and foremost. If one side makes a statement regarding the possibility and necessity of eliminating the other side, of annihilating it, then that approach is absolutely unacceptable for Russia. We have stated this position many times; it is our fundamental position. We feel that we must all aim to strengthen the prevailing principles of international law and conform to those regulations – first and foremost, the United Nations Charter. And we must eliminate and weed out everything else from the theory and practice of international relations.
The Iranian problem is complicated, but I ultimately feel that it can and should be resolved by absolutely peaceful means, by way of negotiations and on the basis of respecting the rights of the Iranian people to the peaceful use of nuclear energy with absolute guarantees to the global community that the implementation of that programme will not lead to the emergence of nuclear weapons and will not promote the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the world.
Question: Mr President, I have a slightly off-topic question. Do you feel that it was right to accept the resignation of the Russian Football Union President Sergei Fursenko? How, and most importantly, when will we know the name of the next Russian Football Union president? Perhaps you already have an idea of who it might be?
Vladimir Putin: I do not know who it might be. The decision to resign was made by Mr Fursenko himself. I spoke with him. He feels (and he said this publicly) that he carries a significant part of the responsibility for our national team’s unsatisfactory performance. He feels that we have a good team, that the players could have done a much better job. He perceives the results to be unsatisfactory and feels that he himself carries a certain, known measure of responsibility, so he made the decision to resign in order to give other people, another person, the future president of the Russian Football Union, the chance to realise his potential and implement his plans.
I feel that this is a very dignified decision and a good one; nobody pushed him to make it, it was his own personal choice. Honestly, I do not know who might be the next president of the Russian Football Union. This is up to the Union itself.
Question: And when?
Vladimir Putin: It shouldn’t take too long, because we need to name the future head coach of the Russian national team and begin work. It’s generally known that sports involve a great deal of work and responsibility to the nation, particularly if we are talking about the national team, and require this process to be well-organised. So here, we need good organisers and specialists. I very much count on the current leaders of the Russian Football Union to choose a worthy coach for the national team, and we will be able to prepare for future kick-offs. Conclusions must be drawn from all the mistakes – those conclusions should be aimed at identifying and eliminating those mistakes and achieving good results. That is what we must aim for, rather than being sad or beating ourselves up.
Question: Today, you opened a science and culture centre in Bethlehem, and the street where it stands is named after you. Did you know about this? How do you feel – not only when this is done abroad, but in Russia as well – about being immortalised like this while you are still living?
Vladimir Putin: Of course, I would love to continue living some more. You say, while still living or not living… In general, as was the case here and in other nations, I was not made aware of it in advance; it was completely unexpected for me today as well. Still, I think that our immortalisation is, first and foremost, up to future generations. But if something like this happens, it is a sensitive issue, especially if it happens abroad: if we protest too much, we can offend people. So honestly, I am a little abashed, but there is nothing to be done about it.
Question: In these two days, you spoke with all the sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Have there been any signs that the situation in settling this conflict may move forward from the current standstill, and were you able to get Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas to agree to a personal meeting?
Vladimir Putin: I did not come here with a goal of encouraging a personal meeting between these two heads of state. But I did get the impression that agreements are possible. In any case, I witnessed a desire from our Israeli partners and friends to meet halfway with the Palestinian side, and the Palestinians certainly want to renew peaceful talks but, of course, after adherence to the many agreements that were reached earlier. We specifically talked about how these are not preliminary conditions, they want to see agreements that were reached earlier.
I do not even want to assess the positions of each of the sides now, but what’s most important, and I do not doubt this, is that there is goodwill both from the Israeli side and the Palestinian side to move forward. I think that we can be witnesses to this movement. But it would be wrong to rule out any parties in this process, particularly the United States. The United States is currently on the threshold of its elections, so I think the Middle East may not be their main priority, but I feel it would be wrong to take any significant steps while excluding the United States’ direct participation, because this always elicits suspicion. Who needs suspicions here, and why? We need to have patience and prepare the next step. It is possible.
Question: Mr President, there is political reform happening in Russia which was launched half a year ago. Are you pleased with how it is progressing? How do you react to the excesses, both by members of the opposition and by the authorities (I am referring to the searches and so on – I imagine you know and follow these events?) And as the guarantor of the Constitution, what can you guarantee for these people?
Vladimir Putin: I want to say that I must guarantee the opportunity for all citizens of the Russian Federation to exercise their rights, regardless of their official capacity, but at the same time, I must strive to ensure that everyone keeps in line with applicable legislation.
As for the searches you mentioned, and certain other things… Believe it or not, I learned about it from the press. If everything was carried out within the framework of applicable law, then it is normal; if there were any infractions, then naturally, we will look into them. But if somebody’s rights were violated, those individuals must turn to relevant authorities – in this case, the courts. I am certain that the courts will react accordingly. I repeat, if rights were violated. And in general, I recommend that all citizens always do exactly that: if their rights are violated, they should turn to the courts.
Now, improving the judicial system is a separate issue, but it is a process, a path that we must travel – a path of gradual evolution by all the structures in our society, and it is that path that will lead us to where we need to be.
Question: You visited the main holy sites here and in Jerusalem. You even prayed at the Wailing Wall. I will venture to ask, what did you pray to God about?
Vladimir Putin: The Wailing Wall is a holy shrine for the Jewish people; it is one of the pillars of one of the world’s major religions, Judaism. As you know, Judaism is one of the four traditional religions in our nation, and this status for Judaism was established by the law of the Russian Federation. Thus, I feel that it is entirely normal to visit this shrine – in this case, a shrine of the Jewish people.
In addition, there are also other considerations. You know, all disputes in the Middle East ultimately come down to this place, because it is a point of contention, and one of the most problematic matters in this discussion is who this place belongs to. First, a synagogue was built here, then other cultural buildings, then still others – and so on. Honestly, I have been here before, I have watched, and I have visited the Wailing Wall, too. But I never had the chance to get to see it so closely. It was very interesting and useful to look at this problem from within, to hear specialists talk about it.
Moreover, I do not know who among you has been there, whether you have seen it or not, but I was able, quite spontaneously, to talk to people who had just come there to pray. I must say that it was an interesting conversation and the people were very open, kind, interested in cooperating with all their sisters and brothers from other faiths. It was very nice to hear and see.
Thank you very much.
