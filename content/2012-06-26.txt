Speech at hospice opening.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Beatitude, Prince Ghazi, friends,
I am happy to welcome everyone taking part in the opening of the Russian hospice located next to one of the most important Christian shrines: the Baptism Site of Jesus Christ.
I would like to thank King Abdullah II of Jordan, who not only gave the Russian Federation a plot of land for this significant project, but fully supported it as well. Our Jordanian friends have done everything possible so that our builders can erect a Russian mission here. And we know how important it is for thousands of pilgrims who come to these places every year. Russians have been visiting these sites since the 13th century. Preserving such shrines brings people closer together and serves our common high moral values.
The Middle East is known as a crossroads of world religions and has known different periods in its history, including some dramatic ones. But the traditions of mutual understanding, mutual enrichment of cultures and customs, have always been strong here.
Everyone is aware of the role played by Jordan and King Abdullah II: in 2005, the Amman Message was adopted, which became an important tool in settling disagreements within Islam. These ideas – ideas of mutual respect and dialogue – are becoming even more popular today, here in the Middle East and throughout the world. The history of Russia, which spans more than a thousand years, also speaks to this; it was created through the efforts and care of people from different ethnic backgrounds and faiths.
I am certain that peace, harmony and mutual understanding will always prevail here at this hospice, in this home for pilgrims. It will always be open to all who cross its threshold with good intentions.
Thank you.

Vladimir Putin answered Russian journalists’ questions

Later, Mr Putin and King Abdullah II took part in the opening of a hospice for Russian pilgrims on the territory of a special archaeological site known as the Baptism Site of Jesus Christ on the Jordan River.
The construction of the hospice began at Mr Putin’s initiative after King Abdullah II gave to the Russian Federation a 1-hectare plot of land for free and perpetual use in 2006. Russia gained the right of ownership to the land in 2012.
The President decorated Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, chief religious and cultural adviser and personal envoy to King Abdullah II, with the Order of Friendship for his big contribution to strengthening the friendship and cooperation between Russia and Jordan.

King Abdullah II of Jordan
(retranslated): Mr President, I would like to welcome you here, to use this opportunity to welcome you on behalf of our entire delegation.
Russia and Jordan have always been bound by good, friendly relations, and your visit here at the beginning of your presidential term once again confirms the special nature of the relations between our two states. Today, you will also participate in the opening of a guesthouse for Russian pilgrims. The land for this building was granted by the Government of Jordan; this is another gesture of our good relations, which will continue to strengthen thanks to your visit.
I hope that your visit will also allow us to strengthen economic and social relations. On the political level, we have always had very good relations. I would like to thank you for coming and express my hope that we will have very fruitful talks.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, friends,
It is a real pleasure for me to be in Jordan again, especially for such a pleasant reason as the opening of the guesthouse for pilgrims. In this regard, I would like to thank you, Your Majesty, for this generous gesture, for assigning to the Russian Federation a stretch of land to build the guesthouse. We view it as a gesture of the particular relations between Jordan and Russia.
Five or six years ago, I met here with Prince Ghazi and it was he who suggested that we build this centre here, which we will be opening today. I recall how impressed I was by his stories about Jordan, and I also remember how he talked about your country, about world history. It was certainly very descriptive, very interesting, and it was then that we decided to build this house.
Your Majesty, we are satisfied with the level of our political dialogue. A great deal can and should still be done in our economic relations. I am very happy for the opportunity to meet with you within the framework of this humanitarian event, to talk about the situation in the region and to compare notes on currently critical regions and hot spots.
We have always approached Jordan’s position with a great attention and respect. We have established very friendly relations. We will do everything possible to further develop them in the future.
Thank you.

Statements for the press following Russian-Palestinian talks

Statements for the press following Russian-Palestinian talks.
President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas (retranslated): Your Excellency, dear friend and our guest who is close to the heart of every Palestinian!
We are happy to welcome you here in Bethlehem, the ancient land of Jesus Christ’s birth, one of the world’s most important historical and spiritual centres along with Jerusalem, the place of Prophet Mohammed’s ascension.
We would like to thank the entire Russian nation, which you represent here, for the comprehensive and multi-faceted assistance it provides to the Palestinian people in their just struggle.
Russia has always provided such support and assistance to the Palestinian people at all stages of their struggle to bring to reality their national aspirations associated with the creation of an independent Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem. Moreover, we are united by unbreakable cultural, spiritual, religious and other bonds. One example of this is the celebration of the 130th anniversary of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society. Last year, a museum and park complex opened here on Palestinian soil, in Jericho, the oldest city in the world. Today we have the honour to accompany your Excellency to the opening ceremony of the Russian Centre for Science and Culture in Bethlehem.
Today the President of Russia and I discussed a number of issues of mutual interest, especially the future development of bilateral Palestinian-Russian relations. We also discussed in detail the situation evolving in the peace process, including Israel’s settlement activities, which are the main obstacle on the path to peace.
We asked His Excellency for assistance in the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons since 1994. Relevant arrangements and agreements with the Israeli side are in place, but unfortunately they are not being executed.
We have confirmed to Mr President that the only way to achieve peace in the region is through negotiations with Israel. We also reiterated today the need for a peace conference in Moscow on the Middle East, as had been agreed some time ago.
We have also discussed the domestic situation in the Palestinian territories and inter-Palestinian reconciliation. I have confirmed to His Excellency that if the timing of presidential and parliamentary elections is determined, we will be able to tackle the reconciliation issue.
Today we also discussed the situation developing in many Arab countries in the light of the Arab Spring events; we stated our position in great detail because we know that our views are of interest for Russia. Events in Arab countries are also of vital importance to us.
Once again, we are happy to welcome Mr President, our dear friend and a person close to every Palestinian heart. We also welcome the delegation accompanying you.
We wish you every success and would like to take this opportunity to express our deep respect to you personally, the friendly Russian people and the friendly Russian Government. We are very glad to see you on Palestinian soil and we hope that your visit to the independent state of Palestine is not in the too distant future.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
First of all I would like to thank our friend President Abbas for his invitation to visit Palestine.
We have just completed our talks with the President of the Palestinian National Authority [Mahmoud Abbas]. I would like to note that the talks were both constructive and informative.
We discussed the situation in the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue and in the Middle East in general. We talked about the region’s problem areas and the prospects of our bilateral cooperation in a wide range of fields.
It is important that we can rely on time-tested traditions as we build our plans for the future. Continuity is one of the key preconditions for the sustained development of bilateral relations.
For example, for Russia there is no problem in recognising an independent Palestinian state. This was done 25 years ago by the Soviet Union, and Russia, as we know, is the Soviet Union’s successor and its position on this matter has not changed. In this regard, I want to emphasise that our discussion on all the issues on our agenda today was very open and constructive.
Our humanitarian contacts are expanding. As you have heard already, the Russian Centre for Science and Culture has opened today in Bethlehem.
I would like to thank our dear friend Mr Abbas for his continued support of the Russian presence in the Holy Land and for effective assistance in the implementation of such projects. I am sure that the centre will help to expand our cooperation in the humanitarian, cultural, scientific and educational spheres, and in the field of youth exchanges.
One example of an excellent tradition of our cooperation remains the special quota for scholarships paid out of the federal budget for Palestinian students studying at Russian Universities.
We should give additional impetus to trade and economic relations. I hope the Business Council for Cooperation with Palestine and the Palestinian-Russian Business Council will play an important role here.
Undoubtedly, we will continue our political dialogue. Our positions are very close or practically identical on all key regional and global issues.
We have discussed in detail the ways of overcoming the crisis in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. I note here the responsible position of the Palestinian leadership and President Mahmoud Abbas, their commitment to a peaceful settlement based on international law and the two-state principle.
I am convinced that any unilateral actions taken before the final reconciliation is reached would be counterproductive. It is essential to exercise the utmost restraint and strictly adhere to the commitments taken on earlier. In addition, the speedy restoration of political unity in Palestine on the platform of the Palestine Liberation Organisation will also contribute to the resolution of the conflict.
We believe that efforts on all these issues are certain to bring about positive results and contribute to stabilising the situation in the Middle East.
In conclusion, I would like to stress once again that we appreciate the readiness of Palestine, the Palestinian people and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to develop a close partnership and friendly relations with Russia. For our part, we will do everything in our power to build up mutually beneficial cooperation.
I would like to thank the Palestinian leadership and President Abbas for today's meeting.
Thank you.
