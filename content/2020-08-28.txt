President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today we will discuss the development of relations with some of our neighbours – states with which we traditionally maintain a broad range of ties due to our geographical proximity.
These relations are developing, and we need to adjust our positions on some key matters, to coordinate them between our agencies and to discuss approaches aimed at the further progressive development of interaction with our partners.
Let us get to work.
