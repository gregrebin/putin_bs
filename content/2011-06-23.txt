President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: I would like to congratulate you on the upcoming 70th anniversary of your news agency, which over the years has come a long way from the legendary Sovinformburo to the fantastic place we see here today.
I just asked Svetlana Mironyuk [RIA Novosti Editor-in-Chief] whether you have a lot of arguments and in general if it’s a problem working in a situation where so many different people are concentrated in one place. The Editor-in-Chief said that you do not fight at all and that the agency is pervaded with a completely new atmosphere.
I would like to confirm that the atmosphere here is absolutely energising and gives the idea of how a modern information agency should work and a modern newsroom should look like.
I sincerely congratulate you and hope that all your projects are successful, that your work continues to fascinate you and we go on giving you interesting reasons for this work. I wish you to earn a lot of money, to launch new projects and continue to be the best in the industry.
I would like to inform you that I have signed a Presidential commendation to the agency’s staff. Once again, congratulations.
