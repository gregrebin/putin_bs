With Head of Kalmykia Alexei Orlov.
Mr Orlov
briefed the President on the socioeconomic situation in the region. Also discussed were appeals made by Kalmykia residents during Direct Line with the President.
Mr Putin noted that there has been progress in Kalmykia, but reminded Mr Orlov of the problems local people raised during Direct Line. They include water supply problems, even in the regional capital, difficulties in purchasing needed medicines, even for people eligible to subsidised medicines, and complaints that schools are asking parents to buy school equipment.
The President asked that these complaints be given full examination and not just passed on down the line. Mr Putin noted that he looks into such matters personally and asked to the regional head to do the same. Mr Orlov promised to take the matters under his personal control without delay.
