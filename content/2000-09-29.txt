Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
We have spent quite a lot of time discussing how to organise the work of the State Council. The Presidential Executive Office and I have closely examined all the proposals made by regional governors and come to the conclusion that the State Council’s current work method is the best one under the present circumstances. It is that of an advisory body.
As I see it, the State Council, despite its seemingly modest status in the current situation, can be a very influential body in the country. It is very important that we should exercise a considered and professional approach in preparing matters for it to discuss. It seems to me that the more thorough the selection of questions for discussion and the more professional and in-depth their consideration by experts before being put before the State Council, the more effective its work will be.
The State Council presidium, although it will meet regularly, will have a rotating membership. I understand this was exactly what those present here proposed. And, in accordance with the opinion of most regional leaders, a final decision was made that the State Council should consist of all regional leaders representing the executive branch of authority.
This allows us to make the most of collective methods of work and be of real help to the Federation Council, State Duma and Government.
I also think the State Council can set a good example of collective efforts, building up good practices for state development in Russia…
…I must say that I very much look forward to the State Council helping me as the head of state by its professional and committed examination of the large-scale issues that should be solved at the highest level, by its professional techniques and knowledge of details and local realities. How the State Council will develop and what roles society will give it in the future is a function of time and the quality of our work.
