President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, friends, colleagues,
We are very pleased to have this chance to have a separate meeting with you on the sidelines of MAKS-2015 to discuss the situation in the region and look at our bilateral relations. I imagine you have found plenty to interest you at MAKS-2015, all the more so, Your Majesty, as you are a military man.
Of course, it will be a pleasure to discuss development in our bilateral contacts with you. I know that our government colleagues in both countries are working with each other. I propose that we talk about all of these matters now.
Once again, welcome.
King of Jordan Abdullah II
: Mr President, thank you very much. Again, I am very impressed today with the air show, it was truly a very memorable occasion to be here with you this afternoon. I was especially touched by the programme you have for the youth, especially with technology and science â€“ that was very impressive.
 I am delighted to be back here in Moscow, and as you well know, we have a very strong and important relationship between our two countries that you have continued to build between our two nations.
 I am looking forward to being able to discuss many of the major challenges in our region that have been plaguing us for several years, and the vital role that you and Russia have been playing for such a long time and continue to play to bring stability to our region.
 Not only trying to bring Israelis and Palestinians closer together to find a peaceful solution to that long and difficult conflict, but also, as you know, I have said for many years, as we try to find a solution for Syria, I have believed that the only way we can find a solution for Syria is the vital role that you and your country play to find a political solution for all parties to bring stability to that country that has endured so much.
 So, your role and the role of your nation is vital for our area, and I am delighted to be back here in Moscow to listen to you and to be able to exchange with you and my colleagues here in Moscow, so, thank you for having us back here.
