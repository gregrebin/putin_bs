The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: We have gathered here in connection with yesterdayâ€™s tragedy, the crash of two planes. Before we start working I would like to express condolences to relatives of the victims.
I have appointed Transportation Minister Igor Levitin chairman of the state commission to investigate the causes of the crash by a relevant order. Above all, I expect you to provide true and fair information on the accident and help everyone who needs it.
We should take all possible efforts to give support to the people in their grief.
I would like to ask the Prosecutor General about the beginning of the investigation of this tragedy.
Vladimir Ustinov: We have launched criminal proceedings. Two teams are working in the Tula and Rostov regions. Both teams are led by my deputies. We are examining a number of versions of the crash, including a terrorist act. There are technical versions, the human factor and others. I will not enumerate them now. We do not give up any version and the work is underway, first of all, in the technical sphere. We have started decoding flight recorders. I believe the investigators will get exhaustive information on the technical causes of the crashes with the help of the state commission and special services.
