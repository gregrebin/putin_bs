Report to the President on mine clearing work in the historical area of Palmyra.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
Since early April, the Russian Defence Ministry’s Engineering Corps have been carrying out a large-scale operation to clear mines from the historic part of Palmyra, which was liberated by the Syrian army with support from Russia’s Aerospace Forces.
Much work has been done to defuse mines of various types and other explosive devices in the historic part of the town. There is still much work ahead to clear mines from facilities and communications in the residential part of the town.
I would like you to report on the current state of progress and on your upcoming plans.
Chief of the Armed Forces Engineers Lieutenant General Yury Stavitsky: Comrade Supreme Commander in Chief,
Pursuant to your decision, since April 2, Russia’s Engineering units have been engaged in mine clearing work at Palmyra, which was liberated from ISIS terrorists.
To carry out this mission, military transport planes deployed to Syria a mine clearing detachment from the Russian Armed Forces mine-clearing centre. In order to increase security and speed up the pace of work, we are also using Uran-6 mobile robot systems and mine-sniffing dogs.
Comrade Supreme Commander in Chief, we have fully completed mine clearing work in the historical part of Palmyra. A total 234 hectares of territory were cleared of explosive devices, as well as 23 kilometres of roads, and 10 historical heritage sites; 2,991 explosive devices were located and defused, including 432 homemade explosive devices.
The work was complicated by the high density of mines and the fact that the fighters used powerful landmines controlled by radio and wires, many of which were installed in such a way as to be impossible to remove.
Our units are now clearing mines in the residential part of the town and at the airport. They have inspected 367 buildings, 40 hectares of territory, 9.5 kilometres of roads, and have destroyed 1,432 explosive devices. The mine clearing work continues in accordance with the approved plan.
A total 560 hectares of urban area still remain to be cleared of mines and unexploded munitions. This work is complicated by the large number of decoy mines the fighters laid. Training is being organised for mine clearance experts from the Syrian army’s engineers.
Furthermore, field water supply has been set up for the drinking water needs of the engineers, military personnel, and the civilians returning to Palmyra.
A field hospital has also been set up and started operation. Construction of living quarters for the UNESCO assessment and restoration group has been completed. We are helping the Syrian engineers engaged in mine clearing in the town of El Karatien and restoration of normal life there. Infrastructure facilities in the town are being rebuilt and 98 families have returned to their homes.
This ends my report.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Mr Savitsky. How many personnel do you have there?
Yury Stavitsky: Currently, we have 98 servicemen engaged in the mine clearing.
Vladimir Putin: Do you have any questions, requests, wishes?
Yury Stavitsky: The service personnel are ready to carry out all your instructions, Mr Commander in Chief.
Vladimir Putin: Please convey my gratitude to all of the servicemen – the officers, soldiers, and the support services. Thank you very much. I wish you good luck.

Presentation of officers appointed to senior command posts
In a ceremony at the Grand Kremlin Palace’s St George Hall, Vladimir Putin congratulated military and security officers and personnel of the Prosecutor General’s Office on their new appointments to senior command posts and conferment of senior (special) ranks and titles.

The Kremlin, Moscow
The President outlined the priority tasks for the armed forces and security forces today and congratulated the officers on their new appointments.
* * * 
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers,
I welcome you all at the Kremlin, at St George Hall, the hall of Russia’s martial glory, and I congratulate you on your new appointments, ranks and special titles. You earned these appointments and ranks through your hard work, professionalism, and dedication to duty. I am sure that in your new capacities, you will continue to work just as effectively and serve this country with just as much honour and conscience. 
Our officers’ corps has always been the stronghold and guarantee of Russia’s statehood. Today, our officers perform their duties with honour and brilliance. The military operation our Armed Forces conducted in Syria is a fine example. In just a short time, our combined forces group brought about a turnaround in the situation and provided powerful support to the legitimate government.
We have also carried out a most important domestic task by combatting terrorist fighters who came from Russia and the CIS countries. Thanks to our Aerospace Forces, the Syrian army has seized the strategic initiative and the terrorist groups have suffered heavy losses.
We will continue to strengthen our Armed Forces and to do everything necessary to give them the modern arms and equipment they need and to carry out the tasks set out in our new National Security Strategy.
Your direct duty as commanders is to raise the quality of performance in training and combat missions, work through tactical issues, develop operations skills and strategy through exercises and snap inspections, and teach the service personnel full mastery of the latest arms and equipment.
The Federal Security Service has a broad range of responsibilities. The Service’s systematic work has reduced the terrorist threat of late.
The Service’s counterintelligence operations have put an end to the activities of 80 intelligence officers from foreign intelligence services operating here in Russia, and identified more than 350 of their agents and individuals suspected of being involved in unlawful activity. You must continue to work competently and consistently in these areas.
It is also important to act resolutely to prevent corruption in state bodies of power and stop embezzlement and misappropriation of budget funds, especially in the execution of state defence procurement contracts.
The FSB Border Guard Service also has great responsibilities. Last year, the Service detained more than 3,300 people for border violations. More than 2,800 criminal cases were opened in connection with illegal border crossing. We need to develop the Service’s analytical potential, modernise its equipment, and create an insurmountable barrier to smuggling, illegal migration, and cross-border crime.
The Foreign Intelligence Service’s competent work also plays a big part in ensuring the nation’s security. Timely information on potential external threats and forecasts on developments in the international situation in unstable parts of the world are vital for taking strategic state decisions.
During the presentation of officers appointed to senior command posts.
Officers, our people expect greater results from the law enforcement agencies, including the Interior Ministry. You must raise the crime detection rate, resolutely combat crime and corruption, and improve preventive work. These issues were at the centre of attention at the Interior Ministry Board review meeting in mid-March.
Recently, the migration service and drug control agency were transferred to the Interior Ministry. I hope that you will develop efficient and well-coordinated work in these important areas as well.
A new executive body, the Federal National Guard Service, was established in early April, on the basis of the Interior Ministry. Its main function is oversight of trade in arms. It will also work closely with the Interior Ministry and the FSB to combat terrorism and organised crime.
Of course, we still have a lot of legislative, organisational and personnel work to do to put in place this new federal service. I am sure that the experience and professionalism of the National Guard personnel will help to resolve effectively the tasks facing this new security agency.
The Prosecutor General’s Office plays an important part in upholding the law. Its personnel ought to concentrate on overseeing the enforcement of people’s social rights, preventing things like delayed wages and pensions and other violations of citizens’ social rights.
Let me remind you that the prosecutors also have a duty to protect the rights of entrepreneurs. It is important to shield businesses from administrative pressure, including by reducing the number of unjustified inspections.
The Investigative Committee personnel also need to improve the quality of their work. A scrupulously collected evidential base is crucial for solving crimes and ensuring fair punishment.
Russia’s rescue personnel work with good coordination and professionalism. They showed their high level of professionalism and personal courage during natural and manmade disaster relief operations and delivery of humanitarian aid, including to conflict zones.
An important task now is to raise the level of protection and security at public places and at social and industrial facilities. Particular attention has to be given to timely response to risks during the spring flood season.
During the presentation of officers appointed to senior command posts.
The Federal Corrections Service should concentrate its work on introducing modern detention standards and reliable security at corrections facilities. I want to stress the point that people at corrections facilities have broken the law, true, but they are still our citizens and the law must protect them.
Officers, I am sure that you will work with honour and do everything necessary to ensure this country’s security. Let me congratulate you once more on these new appointments and senior ranks. I wish you success in your work.
Commander in Chief of the Russian Federation Navy Vladimir Korolyov: Comrade Commander in Chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces,
On behalf of the officers here today, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the great confidence in the officer corps you have placed today, here at the Kremlin.
We fully realise our responsibility for ensuring this country’s defence and security, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This is the task of our mobile armed forces equipped with precision weapons, and manned with combat-ready professionals.
The Navy has a particular role to play in this work. In order to maintain a high level of combat readiness, we hold large-scale exercises in which everyone without exception takes part, from sailors to admirals.
This thorough work has resulted in what is an unprecedented build-up of our forces in recent history in the Arctic and the world oceans. We now have 100 or more naval ships and vessels at sea.
The entire world saw a convincing demonstration of the power of our Aerospace Forces, the Black Sea Fleet, and the Caspian Flotilla, which delivered crushing blows to ISIS and other terrorist groups. This was made possible through our intensive combat training and the quality modernisation that has taken place in our Armed Forces.
Over recent years, the Navy has commissioned and put on ongoing battle readiness the strategic nuclear submarines Vladimir Monomakh and Alexander Nevsky, the large submarines Novorossiisk, Rostov-on-Don and Stary Oskol, and the small missile-carrying ships Serpukhov and Zelyony Dol.
Presentation of officers appointed to senior command posts.
The Navy will soon commission the frigates Fleet Admiral of the Soviet Union Gorshkov, Admiral Grigorovich, and Admiral Essen, and the submarines Krasnodar, Veliky Novgorod, and Kolpino. The Navy is also set to receive three new atomic submarines, construction of which began in 2014.
I can say with certainty that the Navy has everything it needs for performing its military duties to the highest standards. The Navy is ready to carry out its missions.
Mr President, let me thank you for the support and attention the Armed Forces have received on issues such as raising combat readiness, modernising arms and equipment, and most importantly, constant care for the service personnel and their family members.
We are proud of our Armed Forces. I speak not just for my own thoughts and feelings here. These were also the proud words of the junior sergeant to whom you recently presented a state decoration. I can assure you that we will continue developing the glorious traditions of selfless service for the sake of our beloved homeland.
Thank you for your attention.
Head of the Interior Ministry Regional Office in Chelyabinsk Region Andrei Sergeyev: Comrade Commander in Chief,
On behalf of the Interior Ministry delegation, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the opportunity to take part in this ceremony. This is a great honour for each and every one of us.
From one year to the next, the police make great efforts to carry out successfully their difficult and multifaceted responsibilities for keeping the situation in our different regions under control and reliably protecting the state and public from criminal actions.
In the course of their work, the police show high professional, moral and psychological qualities, combat crime bravely and without compromise, and fight terrorist and extremist organisations that are acting with ever-greater ruthlessness. There can be no truce in this struggle, no retreat.
During the presentation of officers appointed to senior command posts.
Mr President, we consider these new senior appointments and ranks as a sign of great trust on your part and there are no words that could adequately express our gratitude.
At the same time, we know that the real measure of the Interior Ministry’s performance is not words, but the security and peace of our tens of millions of ordinary people, who will ultimately give the real evaluation. We can win their respect and live up to your expectations only through dedicated, selfless and honest work. Let me assure you that we will put all our strength, knowledge and experience into this work, to which we have devoted many years now, and will wear our lofty title of law enforcement officers with honour.
Vladimir Putin: Officers,
Let me conclude this ceremony by saying that you have worked hard and achieved much over the past years, otherwise we would not be meeting here today. But in taking a step higher up the career ladder, you must all remember that there is even more work and even greater responsibilities ahead. I hope that you will continue to work with just as much dedication and professionalism and produce even greater results.
I wish you and your families success.

Meeting with Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu
Vladimir Putin met with Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in Russia on a short working visit.

At a meeting with Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.
During their talks, Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu
exchanged opinions on current aspects of bilateral cooperation, including security, and key issues of the global and regional agendas such as prospects for a Palestinian-Israeli settlement and the situation in Syria.
Earlier this week, Mr Putin met with President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas
in the Kremlin to discuss the Middle East peace process.

Beginning of meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, I would like to welcome you in Moscow.
It is very good that we maintain regular contacts at such a high level. Last month, we had the pleasure of receiving the Israeli President here.
I think there are understandable reasons for these intensive contacts, given the complicated situation in the region. This year, we mark the 25th anniversary of the restoration of our diplomatic relations.
Let me begin this meeting today by congratulating you on the upcoming holiday of Passover.
Meeting with Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu (retranslated): Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Welcome!
Benjamin Netanyahu: Mr President, thank you for this warm welcome. I greatly value our regular cooperation, Mr President.
I have come here with the sole concrete objective of strengthening the coordination between our countries in the security area, so as to avoid mistakes, misunderstandings or incidents.
At our previous meetings, I presented our policy on the security of our northern borders. Israel has clear and understandable ‘red lines’ related to our security.
First, we are doing everything we can to ensure that Hezbollah does not get its hands on the ultramodern weapons coming in from Syria and Iraq.
Second, we are doing all we can to prevent the emergence of a new terror front against us on the Golan Heights. This is the ‘red line’ we have set and we will continue to insist on this. Regarding the Golan Heights, we cannot go back to the days when our villages and our children came under fire from there. Therefore, with or without an agreement, the Golan Heights will remain part of Israel’s sovereign territory.
This visit also gives us the chance to discuss bilateral relations, which, as you said, have been developing actively over these past 25 years.
Meeting with Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.
I would particularly like to thank you for your personal contribution to the agreement on pensions, which is now close to its final signing. This is a big issue at the human level, and we value your personal involvement in settling this matter.
I would like to thank you for your congratulations on Passover. This is a holiday symbolising our freedom. Tomorrow, all Jewish people will sit down at the Passover table, and this includes the more than 1 million Russian-speaking Israelis who form a living link, a bridge between our peoples.
I would like to congratulate Jewish people in Russia and throughout the world on Passover and wish them a happy holiday.
Once more, I thank you for your friendship, which is very important for developing relations between our countries and peoples.
Vladimir Putin: It is noteworthy that the Israeli Prime Minister, speaking here at the Kremlin, has congratulated not just Russia’s Jewish community but Jewish people around the world.
Benjamin Netanyahu: Thank you very much.
