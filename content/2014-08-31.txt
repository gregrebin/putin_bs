Meeting with members of Russia’s national judo team
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I want to congratulate you on the very honourable second place that you won in this competition. It was clear that you had the necessary material to become the champions, but there is nothing dishonourable at all about losing to the Japanese, whose country is home to judo.
I am confident that you can win against them too. You showed that you are capable of this. The first two fights went wonderfully and you came out on top against world champions; what’s more, these were beautiful fights with some powerful throws. But the other members of the team have good potential too.
I know that the trainer is working with each of you and putting the emphasis on your individual qualities. It is great to see that we have a growing pool of talent waiting on the reserves’ bench too. I wish you good luck and all the very best.
