Beginning of meeting between the presidents of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan

President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Colleagues, Mr Putin, Mr Lukashenko,
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Astana. Thank you for accepting my invitation to hold this informal, friendly and trust-based meeting at this difficult time.
I think we should discuss the current situation in the world in the light of the crisis we are traversing at this time. The 2007–2008 economic crisis was a global occurrence that began in the United States.
The current crisis, which is regional and global in dimension, is the result of a drop in prices for our energy resources and goods. As a result of this situation, the Eurasian Union’s trade also decreased in 2014. 
We always understood and assumed that such risks exist, and our task now is to reach agreements and for our governments to discuss all of these matters in a businesslike fashion.
I think that 2015 will also present major risks and challenges for the Eurasian Economic Union. We will discuss this with the other member countries and will talk about trade between our countries, as well as our plans for this year.
Of course, we also want to exchange views on the Ukrainian crisis, which has led to the imposition of sanctions and obviously has a particular impact on Russia and thus, by repercussion, on our countries, too. We will exchange views and agree on subsequent meetings.
Kazakhstan currently holds the CIS presidency and Belarus holds the Eurasian Economic Union presidency. The CIS heads of state will meet this autumn here in Kazakhstan, and on May 9, we will meet in Moscow for the 70th anniversary of Victory.
In other words, we have plenty of bilateral and multilateral meetings ahead. We all agree that in addition to the official events and meetings, we also need to be active and flexible in getting together to discuss matters and see where we stand.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: It only remains for me to thank you for your invitation.
You have just outlined all of the items on our agenda. We began the discussion with you at the meeting this morning, and so I simply want to agree with everything you just said and thank you for giving us this opportunity to go over all of these issues together.
President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
: Mr Nazarbayev, I also want to thank you for this opportunity to come to Astana and want to add my agreement to what the Russian President said just now. 
As you were so right in saying, we are going through times that make us confront one challenge or another every year. We face challenges today too, but we also have the economic union that we have built. Events will yet show that the decision to establish this economic union was a timely initiative.
This union is not just a declaration. We have approved a huge number of documents and made this union formal, signing a number of agreements. Now, acting within this union, we need to respond to the challenges at hand. 
There is no point in hiding that at the union’s core are the people and nations that built it and have invested much in its creation. But at the same time, we must also not forget that we have other member countries too, and the union’s initial founders must offer them development scenarios for the future.
As we approach the 70th anniversary of Victory, it is clear that we should all be together. We face too many challenges today, even with regard to history. The Russian President has addressed this issue a lot over recent days, noting the serious challenges we face, including attempts to not simply rewrite but even deny our common history. Therefore, we must demonstrate our unity both politically and economically now, as we prepare to celebrate the 70th anniversary of victory.

Press statement following a meeting between the presidents of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan

Astana
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
As you saw after our meeting, these talks were not lengthy, but we had a full agenda and our discussions were as substantive as always. The great scope of our relations and cooperation and the fact that we already know the issues very well determined the nature of our talks. They were therefore very concrete and we discussed the substance of the various issues that came up.
I had an exchange of views on current matters and bilateral ties with the President of Kazakhstan, and then we were joined by Mr Lukashenko to discuss the full range of ties between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
As the President of Kazakhstan noted, we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the great Victory over Nazism this year. This is a date that our peoples all hold sacred. We look forward to seeing the presidents of Belarus and Kazakhstan at the celebrations in Moscow. War veterans from Kazakhstan and Belarus will join Russian veterans at the parade on Red Square on May 9.
Our three countries share close trade and investment ties. Total combined GDP of our three countries accounts for 85 percent of the CIS
’ GDP. Together, we offer a big market with immense production and scientific potential.
Russia is in first place among Belarus’ and Kazakhstan’s foreign trade partners. Russia’s trade with these two countries came to nearly $60 billion last year. For their part, Belarus and Kazakhstan are together in third place in Russia’s trade balance.

We have growing investment cooperation. Russian investment in the economies of Belarus and Kazakhstan now comes to $18 billion. Belarus and Kazakhstan have invested around $10 billion in Russia. More than 7,000 joint ventures have been established and are in operation.
Industrial and technology cooperation is an important part of our three countries’ partnership. We have joint projects in the machine-building sector. We are also developing our ties in the space sector and are carrying out the roadmap for common use of the Baikonur Space Launch Centre over 2014–2016. I discussed this separately with the President of Kazakhstan today, too.
Our countries’ energy sectors have close links and we work together in hydrocarbon production, transportation and refining.
Russia is helping our friends in Kazakhstan and Belarus to develop their nuclear energy sectors. Rosatom [Russian State Nuclear Energy Corporation] is building a nuclear power plant in Belarus (investment comes to $10 billion and the first unit will be launched in 2018), and is working on construction of Kazakhstan’s first nuclear power plant and carrying out joint uranium production.
We discussed the global economic situation, which remains unstable today. Low business activity, global economic stagnation and volatile raw materials markets have all had a direct impact on the CIS countries. Combined GDP growth for the CIS countries came to only 0.9 percent in 2014. This year, we forecast a decrease of around 1.4 percent.
Despite the oil price collapse, Russia had GDP growth of 0.6 percent last year, but we do face a difficult economic situation. In response, we have put together an anti-crisis programme worth 2.3 trillion rubles to support the economy and social sector. I briefed my colleagues in detail on this today.
We have decided to inject an additional trillion rubles to top up the capital of Russia’s main banks and financial institutions. We are using money from our reserve funds, including the National Welfare Fund. 
Our main goal is to help the real sector of the economy, support industry and agriculture, and encourage job creation. I am sure that these measures will in time help us to get back on track to steady and quality growth.
We agreed to continue coordinating our monetary policy. I think the time has come to discuss the possibility of creating a future currency union. Working shoulder to shoulder, it is easier to respond to financial and economic threats from outside and protect our common market. 
Naturally, we also looked at developing Eurasian integration, the process that Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan initiated. We established the Customs Union together, developed a common economic space and removed most customs and administrative barriers. The Eurasian Economic Union began work on January 1, 2015. Armenia has become a full-fledged member now and Kyrgyzstan has signed an accession treaty.
The common Eurasian market offers guaranteed freedom of movement for goods, services and capital. Member countries’ citizens can work in each other’s countries without having to get any additional permits. We have simplified migration procedures, registration rules and rules for tax payments. We have mutual recognition of diplomas and ensure equal access to healthcare.
We discussed the steps we must take to continue developing our integration ties and building up the Eurasian Economic Union’s legal base. This year, we plan to adopt more than 100 important documents, including the new Customs Code, the concepts for establishing common markets for electricity, gas, oil and petroleum products, and international agreements regulating cooperation in the currency, financial and socioeconomic sectors.
As Mr Nazarbayev mentioned, we also discussed the situation in Ukraine. I want to note Mr Nazarbayev’s and Mr Lukashenko’s active participation and help in settling this issue.
The Minsk agreements of February 12 offer a real chance for gradual de-escalation of this armed conflict. We hope very much that the authorities in Kiev will implement the Minsk agreements in full.
We also examined other matters on the regional agenda. Kazakhstan holds the CIS presidency this year. Russia and Belarus will offer our Kazakhstani friends every possible assistance during Kazakhstan’s presidency.
In conclusion, I want to thank the President of Kazakhstan for the invitation and for giving us the opportunity to discuss all of the issues of mutual interest today.
Thank you for your attention.

Meeting with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev

With President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Mr Putin, I am happy that you have found the time to visit Kazakhstan at this busy and difficult period. We have plenty to discuss.
Last year was rich in events of all kinds. We spent time discussing the Eurasian Economic Union, brought it to completion, and it started work on January 1.
Unfortunately, our union has suffered some challenges due to the decrease of export prices in Russia and Kazakhstan for oil and other export goods. This has slowed economic growth.
We knew these risks existed and we knew that there was a price distortion. The concerns were there. Thank you for the fact that measures were taken after we spoke. The situation has stabilised now in this and other areas. As for the Ukraine issue, we did what we could as the situation allowed. I also got involved in this matter.
We have many events ahead of us, the most important of which is probably the 70th anniversary of Victory. Kazakhstan currently holds the CIS presidency. Our regional meeting will take place in Kazakhstan this autumn. Many of the issues that have come up are being dealt with and settled in routine fashion.
I think that today’s informal trilateral meeting will give us the chance to discuss the current global situation, the events taking place around the world and in our region, our influence, what we can do to overcome the crisis, matters concerning the Eurasian Economic Union, and other issues that concern us all. 
I welcome you and wish you a good stay.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev, thank you very much for this initiative to meet and discuss our current work. Thank you for the invitation. It is always a great pleasure to visit you in Kazakhstan, which is one of our closest partners and allies.
The global economy is indeed going through difficulties at the moment, taking into account the situation on the markets, which you just mentioned. But I am sure that the foundations of the functioning economy and social sector that were developed with your direct participation in Kazakhstan and throughout the post-Soviet area will help us to overcome these difficulties. Of course, we will need to work together, as we have done over these past years, and if we do this, it will be easier for us to find our way out of the current situation.
Your invitation therefore is indeed a good opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations, our integration work, and the various complex problems around the world that also demand our attention.
Thank you very much for the invitation.
