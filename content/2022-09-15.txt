President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Japarov,
I am happy to see you and to be able to discuss topics of mutual interest, of which there are many. Our countries are close; we are strategic partners and allies working together in many international regional organisations.
Russia remains the leading trade and economic partner of the Kyrgyz Republic. We had a notable boost in trade last year. Trade continues to grow this year as well, at a rather high pace. Last year, it grew by 46.6 percent and this year, by 30 percent over the first five months, which is a good result.
Russia continues to provide economic support to Kyrgyzstan. Last year, we offered $20 million in financial aid. This year, $1.5 million was allocated for the restoration of the social infrastructure damaged during certain tragic events in regional border areas. We will continue to do this, taking into account the most recent tragic events as well. We will discuss this matter today.

We are ready to provide technical assistance in emergency relief efforts and natural disaster response. In July, the Government signed a resolution to supply firefighting equipment and helicopters, with around 1.3 billion rubles allocated for this purpose from the Russian budget.
Russia is the largest energy supplier to Kyrgyzstan. At your request, energy is supplied at a concessional rate and free of duty.
Seventy Russian regions are involved in region-to-region cooperation. A conference was held in Yekaterinburg in June.
We are developing humanitarian and cultural links. There are nine Russian-language secondary schools in the Kyrgyz Republic. Teachers from Russia work in Kyrgyz schools, which is very important in our opinion. We want to thank you for supporting the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan. This support of the Russian language is a foundation for developing our relations in many other areas.
Last year, Bishkek successfully hosted the Days of Russian Culture, a conference on spiritual heritage, and a young leaders’ forum. As I have said, all these projects are starting blocks creating conditions for the progress of our relations in the future.
I am very happy to see you and to be able to speak with you on the sidelines of the SCO summit.
President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
I am happy to meet with you again.
Russia has long been our leading trade and economic partner and our biggest strategic ally.
As you noted, over the first six months of this year, Russia-Kyrgyzstan trade doubled year-on-year. We have successful investment projects, supported by the Kyrgyz-Russian Development Fund. To date, the fund has approved 3,200 projects worth $440 million in total.
As you also noted, we expect to start building more secondary schools in the Kyrgyz Republic, including five schools to be completed in 2023 and four schools in 2024.
I am confident that our meeting today will contribute to strengthening the mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia and Kyrgyzstan and our multidimensional cooperation.
Once again, I am happy to see you.
Vladimir Putin: Likewise.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am happy to see you.
I would like to begin our meeting by expressing my gratitude for the warm welcome that was given to me and all members of the Russian delegation during the Caspian Summit in Turkmenistan.
Once again, I want to congratulate you on hosting that event. It was organised at the highest level and facilitated the development of both the relations in the Caspian region, which is very important for us all, and our interstate relations.

This year – we spoke about it in April – we marked the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries, and we can state that the level of strategic partnership that has been attained and outlined in relevant documents is present not only on paper, but in real life as well.
The credit for it goes largely to Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov for his big personal contribution. I would like to ask you to convey my best wishes to him. He did a great deal, and as you know, we acknowledged his achievements in a proper way by presenting him with a state award, the Order for Services to the Fatherland, which in this case referred to both his service to Russia and to Turkmenistan.
I know that Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow is going to visit Russia at the invitation of Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko and will have a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin. I will be pleased to meet with him in person too, and this meeting will definitely be arranged.
Our countries’ governments, ministries and agencies are working towards implementing the agreements reached during your visit to Moscow on June 10, when 14 intergovernmental and interagency documents in various spheres were signed. All of this is very important for the development of our ties, above all the economy, of course. We will promote our relations to a new level. This is stipulated by the Declaration on the Promotion of Strategic Partnership that we signed.
As is known, Russia is a leading trade and economic partner of Turkmenistan, and we intend to increase our share. Unfortunately, over the pandemic year and now, the trade has slightly decreased. Let us just say that this is a topic for discussion and future adjustment, but we simply have to state this in order to understand what else needs to be done in order to even out the situation and develop it further.
On our side, the intergovernmental commission is chaired by Alexei Overchuk, who reports regularly on how the work is progressing, including in high-level working groups. I hope, I am even certain, that the situation will change for the better.
Of course, energy plays a special role in our economic ties. Our leading energy company, Gazprom, has been productively working in Turkmenistan for many years. We have also discussed this issue with you. In general, as far as I understand, the situation suits Turkmenistan; all agreements are being implemented. Tatneft, another Russian energy company, has joined the process. The pipe metallurgical company supplies a significant amount of the products you need for the expansion of pipeline transportation.
In total, there are 190 enterprises with Russian participation operating in Turkmenistan, and I would like to thank you for the Turkmen authorities’ creation of all the necessary conditions for this work.
We aim to diversify our economic ties through other spheres of cooperation, such as agriculture and the textile industry. We are ready to expand the supply of non-primary products to the market of Turkmenistan.
Sixty Russian regions are actively cooperating with Turkmenistan in various areas, and agreements have been signed, with many of them in the trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural spheres.
I would like to thank you in particular for your attitude to the Russian language and Russian culture. We think that this is a highly important aspect that paves the way for collaboration in all areas.
We are grateful for your support for the initiative to construct a new building for the State Russian Drama Theatre in Ashgabat and an additional building for the Pushkin Russian-Turkmen School. We also hope that the plans to establish a Russian-Turkmen university will soon come to fruition.
We actively collaborate internationally, at practically all the international organisations, and our foreign ministries maintain steady contacts.
I am very glad to have an opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of today’s event.
President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to you for the opportunity to have this meeting on the sidelines of the SCO Summit.
I also would like to convey to you warm greetings on behalf of the Chair of the Upper Chamber of Parliament, Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.
Mr President, I would like to note the high level of our bilateral political relations. As you know, our reciprocal visits at the top level are evidence of this. On June 10, I made my first official visit to Moscow, and on June 29, you came on a visit to Ashgabat to participate in the 6th Caspian Summit.
I would also like to note that our inter-parliamentary ties have grown considerably stronger. In May of this year, Ashgabat hosted the first Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Countries of Central Asia and the Russian Federation. In October of this year, as you noted, the Chair of the Upper Chamber of Parliament of Turkmenistan, Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, will also visit the Russian Federation at the invitation of the Speaker of the Federation Council.
Mr President, I want to note that the governments of our two countries maintain contacts on a systemic basis; interagency consultations are also held regularly.
I would like to express my gratitude to you for your firm and invariable support of Turkmenistan’s neutral foreign policy course and my country’s initiatives at the UN and other international organisations.
Thank you very much once again for this meeting within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I am delighted to meet you. I have a warm recollection of my working meetings with your brother [Nawaz Sharif], with whom we met on the sidelines of SCO meetings in Kazakhstan and in Bashkiria, Russia.
I would like to note that we see Pakistan as a priority partner in Southeast Asia and Asia as a whole. Relations between our countries are developing absolutely positively, and we are pleased about that.

I would like to begin our meeting by expressing condolences over the loss of life from natural disasters, the unprecedented flooding in Pakistan. For our part, we are willing to help your people. We have dispatched the necessary humanitarian aid there, and we are ready to help you organise assistance to the flood victims.
As I have noted, our relations are developing very positively and in many spheres. Trade and economic ties are the first sphere worthy of note. Regrettably, our trade has subsided somewhat because of the pandemic, but the next meeting of the intergovernmental commission is scheduled to take place in Karachi this autumn. I hope that our colleagues on both sides will not only find ways to restore mutual trade but also to increase it.
There are things we need to work on, and we see good prospects in several spheres, such as railway transportation and energy. There are very interesting and large-scale projects, namely the Pakistan Stream gas pipeline project, which involves building the infrastructure needed for the delivery of LNG.
The objective is to deliver pipeline gas from Russia to Pakistan. This is possible as well, in view of the fact that some infrastructure is already in place in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. We need to settle the Afghan issue. There are problems with political stability there, but I hope this problem can be settled as well, because we have good relations with the people of Afghanistan. I also have in mind Pakistan’s ability to influence the situation there.
We can implement many other interesting projects. We will do everything in our power to continue working in a positive spirit.
Thank you.
Prime Minister of Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif: Thank you, Your Excellency President Putin.
It is really a great honour and a pleasure to call on you along with my colleagues, the Foreign Minister, Defence Minister and Finance Minister. My brother, Nawaz Sharif, sends you his very warm regards. I brought good wishes for you and the people of your great country, Russia, from Pakistan. The people of Pakistan convey their very good wishes to you.
President Putin, thank you for your condolences message. We have had devastating floods because of unprecedented torrential rains in Pakistan, which have hurt the entire country: 33 million people have been affected, 1,400 have died, and hundreds of children have died. Millions of acres of crops – rice, cotton, sugar cane – all gone. Millions of houses have been damaged, partially or completely. The Foreign Minister’s province of Sindh has been most devastated, as well as Balochistan, and then other parts of Pakistan. Thank you for your support. We have received your valuable support at this critical time. We are very grateful to you.
I just want to let you know that my fond memories with your great country go back to 1968–1969, when I was a student. That was my first trip to any international country. So, I went to Moscow – my father sent me for business training. I met companies like Stankoimport and Mashinexport – they had their office at Dom 35, Moscow. That is my memory with your great country.
At that time, we had barter trade between Pakistan and the Soviet Union. The first steel plant was built by the Soviet Union in Karachi. His grandfather, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, laid the foundation stone. We had tremendous partnership – that is the kind of relationship Pakistan had with your great country. It is on its own, it does not need any support, it is inclusive and it is not at the cost of any other country.
Your Excellency, we want to build our relations with your great country with full commitment and full dedication, because you are a superpower. Pakistan stands to gain from this mutual cooperation, mutual understanding, promoting trade, investment, and other areas like gas pipelines. We had signed a protocol in 2016–2017 that needed to be implemented. Unfortunately, for some reason, it could not be, but I know the potential your great country has, from which Pakistan must benefit in our own interest.
I have come here with my delegation with this proposal for your kind consideration, Mr President. We need to further cement our relations. We need to further build our relations in the field of energy, in the field of trade, in the field of investment and of course other strategic areas.
You are a man of action. You decide, and then you implement. I want to assure you that I want to work closely with you for our mutual [benefit].

It is my sincere pleasure to present this high state award of Russia, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, to President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev.

We have long known you as a strong believer in developing the closest possible relations with Russia on the basis of partnership and true friendship. It is largely thanks to your personal attention that bilateral relations are successfully developing in all areas: politics, economics, science and culture.
With your support, a lot of basic bilateral documents and agreements have been developed and adopted, such as the declaration on comprehensive strategic partnership that we have approved today. Of course, this essential document will bring bilateral relations to an entirely new level, which have always been based on the principles of equality and mutual trust, and do not depend on the current global political situation and external pressure.
More than once I was personally shown the cordiality and hospitality of the Uzbek people. And during this visit, I would like to once again thank you for the warm welcome extended to the Russian delegation.
There is an engraving on a building in the historical part of Samarkand, “There can be no peace except in harmony; there can be no friendship except in fidelity.” I am sure that relations between Russia and Uzbekistan, guided by these wise words, will continue to develop in the spirit of sincere friendship for peace and stability in the region, and the prosperity and well-being of our nations.
Mr Mirziyoyev, my friend,
I congratulate you on receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky and wish you good health, further success, and all the best in your noble mission in the name of serving Uzbekistan and its people, as well as in the name of promoting friendship and harmony between Uzbekistan and Russia.
Vladimir Putin presents the Order of Alexander Nevsky to Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev
: Mr Putin, friends,
Let me express my sincere gratitude to you for presenting me with a prestigious state award of the Russian Federation, the Order of Alexander Nevsky. It is a great honour for me.
We know well that Alexander Nevsky, a great statesman and commander, always defended the interests of his country. His words “God is not in strength, but in truth” are in many ways consonant with the advice of our great ancestor Amir Temur “Strength is in justice.”
The motto of the Order of Alexander Nevsky is very symbolic: For Labour and the Fatherland. Indeed, noble work in the name of the Fatherland deserved the highest recognition at all times and among all nations. I consider this award, first of all, to be high praise for the contribution of the multi-ethnic people of Uzbekistan to the consistent and comprehensive development of the strategic partnership and alliance with Russia.
I believe this is excellent proof of our mutual desire to further promote the friendship between our people and countries and to expand the current constructive and trust-based dialogue at all levels.
Let me stress that I am extremely satisfied with the impressive results of our active and close cooperation in the political, trade, economic, cultural, humanitarian and other spheres, which we achieved in recent years. There is no doubt that these results are a testament to the leadership of President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
And our talks today prove that we have no unresolved issues or unresolved problems – we are making progress everywhere. We intend to further build on this positive momentum, multiply our shared success and reach new levels in all areas of our comprehensive partnership.
Today we have reaffirmed this once again, as I have said, by signing the declaration on comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and Uzbekistan.
I would like to once again express my enormous gratitude for such a distinguished and significant award. I am sure that by working together we will ensure the further development and promotion of practical bilateral cooperation for the well-being and prosperity of our friendly countries and nations.
Once again, Mr President, I am thankful to you for this award. I believe this to be an advance, and in the future – and the declaration signed today attests to this – we will address all issues, all agreements between us, only in a positive manner. And no matter how hard it is, we still find common ground and resolve these issues, and we will continue to resolve them and move forward.
Once again, I thank you. Thank you very much.
