President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Japarov,
I am happy to see you and to be able to discuss topics of mutual interest, of which there are many. Our countries are close; we are strategic partners and allies working together in many international regional organisations.
Russia remains the leading trade and economic partner of the Kyrgyz Republic. We had a notable boost in trade last year. Trade continues to grow this year as well, at a rather high pace. Last year, it grew by 46.6 percent and this year, by 30 percent over the first five months, which is a good result.
Russia continues to provide economic support to Kyrgyzstan. Last year, we offered $20 million in financial aid. This year, $1.5 million was allocated for the restoration of the social infrastructure damaged during certain tragic events in regional border areas. We will continue to do this, taking into account the most recent tragic events as well. We will discuss this matter today.

We are ready to provide technical assistance in emergency relief efforts and natural disaster response. In July, the Government signed a resolution to supply firefighting equipment and helicopters, with around 1.3 billion rubles allocated for this purpose from the Russian budget.
Russia is the largest energy supplier to Kyrgyzstan. At your request, energy is supplied at a concessional rate and free of duty.
Seventy Russian regions are involved in region-to-region cooperation. A conference was held in Yekaterinburg in June.
We are developing humanitarian and cultural links. There are nine Russian-language secondary schools in the Kyrgyz Republic. Teachers from Russia work in Kyrgyz schools, which is very important in our opinion. We want to thank you for supporting the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan. This support of the Russian language is a foundation for developing our relations in many other areas.
Last year, Bishkek successfully hosted the Days of Russian Culture, a conference on spiritual heritage, and a young leaders’ forum. As I have said, all these projects are starting blocks creating conditions for the progress of our relations in the future.
I am very happy to see you and to be able to speak with you on the sidelines of the SCO summit.
President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
I am happy to meet with you again.
Russia has long been our leading trade and economic partner and our biggest strategic ally.
As you noted, over the first six months of this year, Russia-Kyrgyzstan trade doubled year-on-year. We have successful investment projects, supported by the Kyrgyz-Russian Development Fund. To date, the fund has approved 3,200 projects worth $440 million in total.
As you also noted, we expect to start building more secondary schools in the Kyrgyz Republic, including five schools to be completed in 2023 and four schools in 2024.
I am confident that our meeting today will contribute to strengthening the mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia and Kyrgyzstan and our multidimensional cooperation.
Once again, I am happy to see you.
Vladimir Putin: Likewise.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am happy to see you.
I would like to begin our meeting by expressing my gratitude for the warm welcome that was given to me and all members of the Russian delegation during the Caspian Summit in Turkmenistan.
Once again, I want to congratulate you on hosting that event. It was organised at the highest level and facilitated the development of both the relations in the Caspian region, which is very important for us all, and our interstate relations.

This year – we spoke about it in April – we marked the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries, and we can state that the level of strategic partnership that has been attained and outlined in relevant documents is present not only on paper, but in real life as well.
The credit for it goes largely to Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov for his big personal contribution. I would like to ask you to convey my best wishes to him. He did a great deal, and as you know, we acknowledged his achievements in a proper way by presenting him with a state award, the Order for Services to the Fatherland, which in this case referred to both his service to Russia and to Turkmenistan.
I know that Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow is going to visit Russia at the invitation of Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko and will have a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin. I will be pleased to meet with him in person too, and this meeting will definitely be arranged.
Our countries’ governments, ministries and agencies are working towards implementing the agreements reached during your visit to Moscow on June 10, when 14 intergovernmental and interagency documents in various spheres were signed. All of this is very important for the development of our ties, above all the economy, of course. We will promote our relations to a new level. This is stipulated by the Declaration on the Promotion of Strategic Partnership that we signed.
As is known, Russia is a leading trade and economic partner of Turkmenistan, and we intend to increase our share. Unfortunately, over the pandemic year and now, the trade has slightly decreased. Let us just say that this is a topic for discussion and future adjustment, but we simply have to state this in order to understand what else needs to be done in order to even out the situation and develop it further.
On our side, the intergovernmental commission is chaired by Alexei Overchuk, who reports regularly on how the work is progressing, including in high-level working groups. I hope, I am even certain, that the situation will change for the better.
Of course, energy plays a special role in our economic ties. Our leading energy company, Gazprom, has been productively working in Turkmenistan for many years. We have also discussed this issue with you. In general, as far as I understand, the situation suits Turkmenistan; all agreements are being implemented. Tatneft, another Russian energy company, has joined the process. The pipe metallurgical company supplies a significant amount of the products you need for the expansion of pipeline transportation.
In total, there are 190 enterprises with Russian participation operating in Turkmenistan, and I would like to thank you for the Turkmen authorities’ creation of all the necessary conditions for this work.
We aim to diversify our economic ties through other spheres of cooperation, such as agriculture and the textile industry. We are ready to expand the supply of non-primary products to the market of Turkmenistan.
Sixty Russian regions are actively cooperating with Turkmenistan in various areas, and agreements have been signed, with many of them in the trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural spheres.
I would like to thank you in particular for your attitude to the Russian language and Russian culture. We think that this is a highly important aspect that paves the way for collaboration in all areas.
We are grateful for your support for the initiative to construct a new building for the State Russian Drama Theatre in Ashgabat and an additional building for the Pushkin Russian-Turkmen School. We also hope that the plans to establish a Russian-Turkmen university will soon come to fruition.
We actively collaborate internationally, at practically all the international organisations, and our foreign ministries maintain steady contacts.
I am very glad to have an opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of today’s event.
President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to you for the opportunity to have this meeting on the sidelines of the SCO Summit.
I also would like to convey to you warm greetings on behalf of the Chair of the Upper Chamber of Parliament, Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.
Mr President, I would like to note the high level of our bilateral political relations. As you know, our reciprocal visits at the top level are evidence of this. On June 10, I made my first official visit to Moscow, and on June 29, you came on a visit to Ashgabat to participate in the 6th Caspian Summit.
I would also like to note that our inter-parliamentary ties have grown considerably stronger. In May of this year, Ashgabat hosted the first Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Countries of Central Asia and the Russian Federation. In October of this year, as you noted, the Chair of the Upper Chamber of Parliament of Turkmenistan, Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, will also visit the Russian Federation at the invitation of the Speaker of the Federation Council.
Mr President, I want to note that the governments of our two countries maintain contacts on a systemic basis; interagency consultations are also held regularly.
I would like to express my gratitude to you for your firm and invariable support of Turkmenistan’s neutral foreign policy course and my country’s initiatives at the UN and other international organisations.
Thank you very much once again for this meeting within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I am delighted to meet you. I have a warm recollection of my working meetings with your brother [Nawaz Sharif], with whom we met on the sidelines of SCO meetings in Kazakhstan and in Bashkiria, Russia.
I would like to note that we see Pakistan as a priority partner in Southeast Asia and Asia as a whole. Relations between our countries are developing absolutely positively, and we are pleased about that.

I would like to begin our meeting by expressing condolences over the loss of life from natural disasters, the unprecedented flooding in Pakistan. For our part, we are willing to help your people. We have dispatched the necessary humanitarian aid there, and we are ready to help you organise assistance to the flood victims.
As I have noted, our relations are developing very positively and in many spheres. Trade and economic ties are the first sphere worthy of note. Regrettably, our trade has subsided somewhat because of the pandemic, but the next meeting of the intergovernmental commission is scheduled to take place in Karachi this autumn. I hope that our colleagues on both sides will not only find ways to restore mutual trade but also to increase it.
There are things we need to work on, and we see good prospects in several spheres, such as railway transportation and energy. There are very interesting and large-scale projects, namely the Pakistan Stream gas pipeline project, which involves building the infrastructure needed for the delivery of LNG.
The objective is to deliver pipeline gas from Russia to Pakistan. This is possible as well, in view of the fact that some infrastructure is already in place in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. We need to settle the Afghan issue. There are problems with political stability there, but I hope this problem can be settled as well, because we have good relations with the people of Afghanistan. I also have in mind Pakistan’s ability to influence the situation there.
We can implement many other interesting projects. We will do everything in our power to continue working in a positive spirit.
Thank you.
Prime Minister of Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif: Thank you, Your Excellency President Putin.
It is really a great honour and a pleasure to call on you along with my colleagues, the Foreign Minister, Defence Minister and Finance Minister. My brother, Nawaz Sharif, sends you his very warm regards. I brought good wishes for you and the people of your great country, Russia, from Pakistan. The people of Pakistan convey their very good wishes to you.
President Putin, thank you for your condolences message. We have had devastating floods because of unprecedented torrential rains in Pakistan, which have hurt the entire country: 33 million people have been affected, 1,400 have died, and hundreds of children have died. Millions of acres of crops – rice, cotton, sugar cane – all gone. Millions of houses have been damaged, partially or completely. The Foreign Minister’s province of Sindh has been most devastated, as well as Balochistan, and then other parts of Pakistan. Thank you for your support. We have received your valuable support at this critical time. We are very grateful to you.
I just want to let you know that my fond memories with your great country go back to 1968–1969, when I was a student. That was my first trip to any international country. So, I went to Moscow – my father sent me for business training. I met companies like Stankoimport and Mashinexport – they had their office at Dom 35, Moscow. That is my memory with your great country.
At that time, we had barter trade between Pakistan and the Soviet Union. The first steel plant was built by the Soviet Union in Karachi. His grandfather, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, laid the foundation stone. We had tremendous partnership – that is the kind of relationship Pakistan had with your great country. It is on its own, it does not need any support, it is inclusive and it is not at the cost of any other country.
Your Excellency, we want to build our relations with your great country with full commitment and full dedication, because you are a superpower. Pakistan stands to gain from this mutual cooperation, mutual understanding, promoting trade, investment, and other areas like gas pipelines. We had signed a protocol in 2016–2017 that needed to be implemented. Unfortunately, for some reason, it could not be, but I know the potential your great country has, from which Pakistan must benefit in our own interest.
I have come here with my delegation with this proposal for your kind consideration, Mr President. We need to further cement our relations. We need to further build our relations in the field of energy, in the field of trade, in the field of investment and of course other strategic areas.
You are a man of action. You decide, and then you implement. I want to assure you that I want to work closely with you for our mutual [benefit].

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
It is my sincere pleasure to present this high state award of Russia, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, to President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
This order is awarded to foreign leaders for major contributions to promoting friendly ties with Russia. And you, Mr Mirziyoyev, deserve this prestigious Russian award more than anyone.

We have long known you as a strong believer in developing the closest possible relations with Russia on the basis of partnership and true friendship. It is largely thanks to your personal attention that bilateral relations are successfully developing in all areas: politics, economics, science and culture.
With your support, a lot of basic bilateral documents and agreements have been developed and adopted, such as the declaration on comprehensive strategic partnership that we have approved today. Of course, this essential document will bring bilateral relations to an entirely new level, which have always been based on the principles of equality and mutual trust, and do not depend on the current global political situation and external pressure.
More than once I was personally shown the cordiality and hospitality of the Uzbek people. And during this visit, I would like to once again thank you for the warm welcome extended to the Russian delegation.
There is an engraving on a building in the historical part of Samarkand, “There can be no peace except in harmony; there can be no friendship except in fidelity.” I am sure that relations between Russia and Uzbekistan, guided by these wise words, will continue to develop in the spirit of sincere friendship for peace and stability in the region, and the prosperity and well-being of our nations.
Mr Mirziyoyev, my friend,
I congratulate you on receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky and wish you good health, further success, and all the best in your noble mission in the name of serving Uzbekistan and its people, as well as in the name of promoting friendship and harmony between Uzbekistan and Russia.
Vladimir Putin presents the Order of Alexander Nevsky to Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev
: Mr Putin, friends,
Let me express my sincere gratitude to you for presenting me with a prestigious state award of the Russian Federation, the Order of Alexander Nevsky. It is a great honour for me.
We know well that Alexander Nevsky, a great statesman and commander, always defended the interests of his country. His words “God is not in strength, but in truth” are in many ways consonant with the advice of our great ancestor Amir Temur “Strength is in justice.”
The motto of the Order of Alexander Nevsky is very symbolic: For Labour and the Fatherland. Indeed, noble work in the name of the Fatherland deserved the highest recognition at all times and among all nations. I consider this award, first of all, to be high praise for the contribution of the multi-ethnic people of Uzbekistan to the consistent and comprehensive development of the strategic partnership and alliance with Russia.
I believe this is excellent proof of our mutual desire to further promote the friendship between our people and countries and to expand the current constructive and trust-based dialogue at all levels.
Let me stress that I am extremely satisfied with the impressive results of our active and close cooperation in the political, trade, economic, cultural, humanitarian and other spheres, which we achieved in recent years. There is no doubt that these results are a testament to the leadership of President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
And our talks today prove that we have no unresolved issues or unresolved problems – we are making progress everywhere. We intend to further build on this positive momentum, multiply our shared success and reach new levels in all areas of our comprehensive partnership.
Today we have reaffirmed this once again, as I have said, by signing the declaration on comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and Uzbekistan.
I would like to once again express my enormous gratitude for such a distinguished and significant award. I am sure that by working together we will ensure the further development and promotion of practical bilateral cooperation for the well-being and prosperity of our friendly countries and nations.
Once again, Mr President, I am thankful to you for this award. I believe this to be an advance, and in the future – and the declaration signed today attests to this – we will address all issues, all agreements between us, only in a positive manner. And no matter how hard it is, we still find common ground and resolve these issues, and we will continue to resolve them and move forward.
Once again, I thank you. Thank you very much.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am happy to meet with you once again.
Relations between Russia and Iran are developing in all areas that have taken shape over many years.
Just as you and I had agreed, we have done everything possible to make Iran a full-fledged member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Our SCO partners supported your application. Following the last formality, and indeed this is a formality, Iran will join this serious, large and influential international organisation. We are very happy to see this.

Bilateral cooperation, including high-tech cooperation, also continues to develop. As you know, the Khayyam remote sensing satellite, developed by Russian enterprises as per your request, lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on August 9.
We are finalising a new major Russian-Iranian treaty that will elevate our relations to the level of strategic partnership.
In 2021, mutual trade grew by 81 percent, and increased by an additional 30 percent in the first five months of 2022. Members of the inter-governmental commission are working actively. Next week, a large Russian business delegation involving about 80 Russian companies will travel to Iran.
Members of the first such business mission visited Iran in May 2022, and I would like to say that many delegation members later shared their impressions with me. They were very happy with what they saw at Iranian enterprises, in the context of high-tech development. To be honest, we did not expect this. Consequently, we and I personally would like to congratulate you on this.
Inter-regional ties continue to develop. We cooperate actively on the international scene, and we have close or coinciding views (as diplomats say) on many issues.
I recall how Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, warmly received us in Tehran not so long ago. Many projects are making headway thanks to his support. I would like to ask you to convey my best wishes to him.
President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi
(retranslated): In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful,
Mr President,
I am again very happy to have this opportunity to meet with you. And I feel very flattered that you said that since our last meeting our agreements have been successfully implemented, they are being put into effect.
Thank you very much, and I want to thank the Russian Federation for your support of Iran’s full-fledged membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
As for the bilateral agenda, we have the necessary will to develop these relations. You know, our relations are not ordinary; they are strategic and have a strategic value. We need to develop our cooperation in the political, economic, commercial areas, in aeronautics and space exploration.
Your visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran was successful. We met with each other there, and you also had a meeting with our Supreme Leader. Following that meeting, the Supreme Leader, His Holiness, gave us instructions and we are implementing them in full.
We believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is the kind of partnership and mutual cooperation that would benefit not only the Islamic Republic of Iran, but all members of this organisation in general.
Thank you so much and thanks to the Russian Federation for your active support for Iran’s acceptance as a full-fledged member of the EAEU and BRICS. We know that this is also a mutual partnership that will serve in the interests of the entire region, and it will strengthen our ties.
All issues on the bilateral agenda are under the auspices of the Vice-President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the Foreign Minister. We should do concrete work on the issue of holding a meeting of the intergovernmental commission of the Islamic Republic and the Russian Federation. It is necessary to implement the existing agreements and turn them into practical deeds as soon as possible.
You know, the Americans think so, or they believe that by declaring sanctions against a state, they can impair its willpower and forward movement. However, I believe that they are miscalculating; this is a mistake. For years, they have been imposing sanctions on us, we are facing their unilateral sanctions, but the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran have managed to avert this threat and the sanctions that they are imposing on us.
Regarding the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we do not recognise these sanctions, we will never recognise them, and we will strengthen and expand our relations with the Russian Federation in the trade and economic sphere. You know, mutual relations between such countries as the Islamic Republic of Iran and Russia that are subject to US sanctions are something that can strengthen our ties and implement our achievements and our agreements.
We are successfully implementing everything, including fiscal matters, banking issues and our relations in the trade and economic sphere, under your auspices. We know that you have issued good orders, and our project, namely, the North-South corridor, is being implemented successfully. The Islamic Republic of Iran has also issued the necessary orders, so that our colleagues address this issue post-haste in order to make all this a reality.
We believe that, considering the excellent partnership that is shaping up or that has shaped up between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation, we can take positive steps forward in order to completely ensure the interests of our countries.
Of course, we can push aside all the sanctions, as well as the threats that the United States of America is imposing on our countries. You know, the Islamic Republic of Iran has the required goodwill, and we are making a goodwill gesture: we never leave and will never leave the negotiating table. However, it has been proven, and the whole world knows that it is impossible to reach an agreement with the United States of America, it violates all obligations. Of course, everyone knows that the European Union is also in a passive situation, unable to keep its promises.
Vladimir Putin: It is their word, and they either keep it or not, as they see fit.

Meeting with PRC President Xi Jinping and President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh

Bilateral talks between the President of Russia and the President of China took place earlier in the day.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, President Khurelsukh,
My dear friends,
I am happy to hold our talks in a trilateral format to discuss current issues related to developing our cooperation.
Russia is interested in the comprehensive promotion of relations with each of your states and I must say that relations are developing dynamically, constructively and for the benefit of all.
Of course, the Russia-China-Mongolia format is of special importance as an effective supplement to bilateral cooperation that ensures high added value for all three countries.

This close trilateral cooperation is completely natural, considering the geographical proximity and long-standing traditions of friendship, mutual support, respect and sympathy in relations between the people of Russia, China and Mongolia.
Our countries share approaches to a majority of urgent international issues and we act from coordinated positions in the UN and regional organisations. Together, we have managed to achieve tangible results in developing cooperation in the economy, trade, industry, science, high technology, environmental protection, the cultural, humanitarian and many other spheres.
I would like to recall that at a trilateral summit in Ufa in 2015, we endorsed a roadmap to build up our cooperation across the board. Following this fundamental document, in 2016 we approved a programme for creating a Russia-Mongolia-China economic corridor. Today, we can note with satisfaction that all these agreements are being successfully implemented and are yielding us practical dividends.
Mutual trade is growing year by year. Compared to 2014, when we started the trilateral format, Russia’s aggregate trade with China and Mongolia increased by almost 60 percent to over $142 billion in 2021. This amount grew by another 30 percent in the first half of this year.
The consistent course pursued by our three countries on broader use of national currencies in commercial settlements undoubtedly contributes to trade growth. Today, President Xi and I stated with satisfaction that the share of settlements in national currencies in Russia's trade with China increased to 27.5 percent in the first quarter of this year.
In this context, it is important, wherever possible, to transition to national payment platforms, such as the Bank of Russia’s financial messaging system or China’s cross-border payment system, which will make settlements between our states largely immune to external risks, including political risks.
Further development of multifaceted cooperation between the business circles of Russia, China and Mongolia, including as part of interregional and cross-border cooperation, should also be promoted in every possible way.
The regularly held joint tripartite business forums, fairs and exhibitions are enormously effective as well. In particular, the Joint Trade and Economic Forum of the three countries with the participation of a representative Russian delegation is scheduled to be held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in autumn.
Undoubtedly, reinforcing trade, economic and investment ties between Russia, China and Mongolia is an important part of the integration processes in Eurasia and ties in well with the EAEU development processes and efforts to move forward China’s One Belt One Road initiative and Mongolia’s Steppe Road initiative.
Based on the existing record of accomplishment of trilateral cooperation, we propose focusing our efforts on the sustained implementation of the programme for expanding the Russian-Chinese-Mongolian economic corridor. Since it is making good progress, we agreed to renew it for another five-year period.
It appears that the efforts to move this programme forward should focus on further expansion of joint transport and logistics infrastructure and the creation of closer coordination of the national transport development programmes.
These steps will help facilitate a significant increase in cross-border cargo transportation and growth in mutual trade, and will also boost regional development.
The critical joint projects include modernisation of the Ulaanbaatar Railway, which is an important artery for container traffic between Russia, Mongolia and China. We believe it is necessary to continue to expand the capacity of this transport corridor and to renovate tracks, rolling stock and locomotive power.
In particular, we plan to renovate the Naushki checkpoint on the Russian-Mongolian border in order to increase cargo transit capacity to 15 million tonnes by 2025. We hope that existing border crossings on the Chinese-Mongolian border will benefit from its expanded capacity and more border crossings will be built.
It is also worth thinking about expanding and upgrading another transit corridor that goes through eastern Mongolia, which will be beneficial for traffic volume and speed, and will also make it possible to evenly distribute the load among the three countries’ transport networks.
We believe that expanding cooperation with China and Mongolia in the energy sector holds promise. The construction of the Soyuz Vostok gas pipeline from Russia to China across Mongolia is part of the current agenda. We discussed this issue in depth with your representatives who took part in the Eastern Economic Forum last week. Gazprom is in the final stages of discussing project details with the Chinese and Mongolian parties.
Chances are good for increasing Russia’s cross-border electricity supplies to China and Mongolia. Friends, we predict that energy transmission from Russia to your respective countries will have grown by about 20 percent to 5.2 billion kilowatt-hours by the end of this year.
No doubt, there are many more promising areas for trilateral cooperation. In particular, Russia is open to closer partnership with China and Mongolia in scientific research and the high-tech industry, including in areas such as creating modern science towns, technology parks and joint laboratories and expanding scientific and technical exchanges, as well as training and advanced training for academic and engineering professionals.
Of great importance is the implementation of trilateral transboundary environmental programmes aimed at preserving unique flora and fauna and developing specially protected natural areas in our common region.
Of course, it is also important to carry on our effective cooperation in the fight against infectious diseases, in particular, to improve the mechanisms of monitoring transmitting agents and the epidemiological situation in cross-border regions as a whole, as well as to coordinate efforts to prevent disease and set up quarantines.
Needless to say, special attention should be given to the development of cooperation among our countries in the tourism sphere. It would be useful to work together to create new transboundary and international travel routes across Russia, China and Mongolia, which will attract tourists not only from our countries but from across the world.
In conclusion, I would like to express certainty that the agreements we have reached today will help strengthen interaction between Russia, China and Mongolia in all spheres.
Thank you. I turn the floor over to the President of the People’s Republic of China, Mr Xi Jinping.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): President Putin, President Khurelsukh,
It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to participate with you in the 6th meeting of the Council of the Heads of State of Russia, China, and Mongolia. I welcome our Mongolian colleague, who is taking part in this event for the first time.
I would like to thank Russia and Mongolia for their substantial support to China earlier this year.
I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to review with you the results of the trilateral cooperation and outline new plans. I support President Putin’s positive assessment of our trilateral cooperation.
Our cooperation is elastic in its development, and it is focused in all directions. Over the past three years, our cooperation has successfully advanced despite the negative impact of the epidemic. The central and local governments of our countries are actively cooperating and promoting this cooperation. This is something to be commended.
In recent years, we have been actively cooperating to ensure the health of our countries’ people. After the onset of the Covid epidemic, we jointly analysed experiences, adopted the necessary quarantine measures, and began to develop appropriate vaccines.
There is a long history of cooperation between China and Mongolia, and our three countries as neighbors, maintain a high intensity of contacts, and are confident in the prospects for trilateral cooperation. In recent years, cooperation between our countries in educational and cultural exchanges has been growing.
New border crossing points are being opened actively, which stimulates cross-border cooperation and promotes stable trilateral trade. China makes great efforts to open as many border checkpoints as possible and to actively contribute to the coordinated development of the economies of our three nations.
We are working to ensure stable operation of transport and logistics channels. We hope that this year we will be able to reach a trade volume of $10 billion between China and Mongolia. We also hope that soon trade between Russia and China will reach $200 billion.
The program you mentioned is being intensively implemented and will be extended for five years. Its effectiveness for the development of our region is obvious.
Regarding the prospects for our cooperation, I have several suggestions.
First, steady movement in a definite direction of cooperation. We should strengthen political leadership, formulate a roadmap for our joint actions, support each other, take care of each other’s concerns, and respect each other’s interests.
Second, raising the level of cooperation within the SCO. China also hopes that Mongolia will decide to join the SCO as early as possible, show its natural advantages, contribute to the progress of this organisation and thus gain new benefits in order to face new challenges more effectively and make full use of the SCO platform.
Third, reaching an understanding as soon as possible on the creation of a cross-border economic corridor. We believe there is a need to extend the relevant joint program. Together with Russia and Mongolia, China intends to fully realise its geographical advantages and further promote trade in order to provide a high-quality communication platform to representatives of the three countries’ industry and economy.
Fourth, China proposes to actively expand cooperation in energy. We suggest that the three countries and their leading businesses coordinate and reach an understanding on mutually beneficial cooperation.
China actively supports broader use of settlements in national currencies and will welcome even more enterprises from Russia and Mongolia to join the yuan payment circuit.
Russia, Mongolia, and China have a long history of cooperation, which has produced notable results. I would like to continue to coordinate closely with my colleagues on this issue.
President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh
(retranslated): President of the Russian Federation, Chairman of today's meeting of the leaders of the three states – Mongolia, Russia and China, Mr Vladimir Putin,
President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping,
Ladies and gentlemen,
First of all, I would like to thank you for your speeches and for the important proposals on cooperation between our three countries.
I am glad that the sixth meeting of heads of state of Mongolia, Russia and China is traditionally being held on the sidelines of the SCO Heads of States Council meetings in Samarkand, in the Republic of Uzbekistan. I am confident that today's meeting of the heads of state following a break caused by the pandemic, will be effective and will give a new impetus to the development of cooperation between our three countries.
Mongolia, as an observer country, closely cooperates with and actively participates in SCO Heads of States Summits and other SCO events and meetings.
Our country is keen to further expand cooperation with SCO member states in trade, investment, energy, transport logistics, environmental protection, tourism, information technology, agriculture, humanitarian affairs, food security and food distribution, and to implement major joint projects of regional economic development.
We have a proverb: ”A close neighbour is better than a distant relative.“ Expanding friendly relations and cooperation with our two neighbours, Russia and China, is a priority of Mongolia's foreign policy.
Our country intends to further strengthen mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation with our neighbours at the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership, and to implement joint programmes and projects intended for our region’s sustainable development.
Over the past period, trilateral cooperation between Mongolia, Russia and China has expanded. Joint working group meetings have been held even in the challenging conditions amid the pandemic. There have been successful high-level reciprocal visits of the three countries’ foreign ministers and other top government officials. We maintain the frequency of our dialogue.
At this time, when the international environment is unstable and outbreaks of the pandemic still continue, further cooperation in strengthening trade and economic relations with real results is very important.
In this regard, Mongolia believes that the successful implementation of the Mongolia-Russia-China Economic Corridor Programme will strengthen the strategic partnership of our three countries and take cooperation to a new level within our region.
Heads of state, friends,
At this meeting, Mongolia is voicing its positions on the following important issues, and it expects to see results.
Thanks to its location linking Asia with Europe, Mongolia strives to become a key transit hub for developing transportation, trade and services.
Once again, I suggest that we conduct a feasibility study, modernise the Central Railway Corridor of the Mongolia-Russia-China economic corridor programme more actively, and that we start jointly implementing economically effective strategic projects, including the construction of the Eastern Corridor railway that would pass through eastern Mongolia, linking the Russian Federation’s Trans-Baikal Territory with northeastern China. This also includes the Western Transport Corridor linking Tyva in the Russian Federation with northern Chinese provinces via western Mongolia and the construction of a high-speed motorway linking the three countries.
I also suggest including a trans-border railway between Mongolia and China in the direction of Sainshand, Dzun-Bayan, Khangi, Mandal, Bugat and Ulantsav in the modernisation programme of the Central Railway Corridor.
In 2019, during the fifth meeting between the heads of state of our three countries, President Vladimir Putin touched upon the issue of building a new railway branch towards Dzun-Bayan and Khangi. We see construction of this new railway branch as a significant infrastructure project. By building this section, Russia and Mongolia will be able to redistribute cargo flows and reduce the load on the operational checkpoint on the Mongolian-Chinese border.
This railway will considerably expand trade between our countries, as well as freight traffic volumes via the railway. I ask the Chinese side to pay special attention to this. I am confident that you will support the project for building a high-speed motorway that would run parallel to the Asia Highway (AH3), and that you will directly participate in it. The AH3 is the most congested and economically important transportation artery linking our countries. Under the decision of Mongolia, the project is implemented using the public-private partnership concept.
I call on the sides to continue working actively and to implement agreements between the governments of Mongolia, Russia and China as regards international traffic via Asian motorways, and to score real successes and results in expanding trans-border traffic volumes between our countries.
Secondly, the Government of Mongolia is focused on building a gas pipeline that will supply natural gas from Russia to China via Mongolia, and is making every effort to complete it. In 2019, the President of the People’s Republic of China, Mr Xi Jinping, noted this at the third meeting of the three countries’ heads of state.
We also support a project for laying oil and gas pipelines that would deliver natural gas from Russia to China via Mongolia. I suggest we analyse this issue and conduct a feasibility study. 
As we step up and implement the gas pipeline project connecting our three countries, cooperation and mutual understanding between our supervising organisations are important. The Mongolian party is confident that the project will be realised successfully. Its implementation will become the second mega-project of our countries after the construction of the railroad that connected Mongolia, Russia and China in 1955.
Thirdly, Mongolia is a country that suffers greatly from the negative impact of climate change. Desertification and sand storms negatively affect the environment and the socio-economic situation as a whole.
In this regard, to counteract climate change, desertification and sand storms, as well as to increase its forest and water resources, Mongolia has initiated the Billion Trees national movement, which includes planting, growing and protecting forests in our country.
In accordance with previous discussions with you, I would like to bring up a proposal to jointly implement some projects and programmes of the Billion Trees national movement in Mongolia, adjusting them to the environmental policies and activities of our neighbouring countries.
As part of this work, the construction of the Erdeneburen Hydropower Plant began with the participation of our southern neighbour. I would also like to express our interest in cooperating with our northern neighbour, Russia, in the construction of the Egiin Hydropower Plant.
Fourthly, I consider it practical, while implementing major projects such as the construction of railroads and gas pipelines as part of trilateral cooperation, to discuss the creation of a joint investment planning centre of the three countries in Ulaanbaatar and creating a relevant joint working group.
Mongolia is committed to actively promoting trilateral cooperation and reaching substantial results as part of the roadmap to develop trilateral cooperation in the long term and the programme to create the Mongolia-Russia-China economic corridor.
I believe that, in addition to the key areas of trilateral trade and economic cooperation, we should pay due attention to the development of cooperation in such areas as science, culture, education, humanitarian activities, tourism and natural disaster relief. Mongolia will continue, within the multifaceted strategic partnership, to closely cooperate with its neighbours to further develop and expand trilateral cooperation.
At this meeting, we discussed the current issues of our relations and cooperation between our three countries.
President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, chairman of this meeting,
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping and other officials,
I would like to express my deepest appreciation. Let me express confidence that the friendship and mutual trust between our nations will grow stronger. We are connected by land, ancient history and Mother Nature itself, and the goal of our cooperation is progress, which will develop and expand for the benefit of good initiatives.
Thank you for your attention.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Chairman, Mr President,
For my part, I would also like to thank you for a substantive exchange of views and information. I would like to say that our now traditional trilateral meetings on the sidelines of SCO events definitely benefit the development of relations between our countries.
I agree with you that we should emphasise the expansion of our practical cooperation in all spheres, and I believe that the unconditional implementation of the agreements we have discussed, after their expert examination at the practical and professional level, will certainly benefit us.
In conclusion, I would like to express hope for the continuation of our fruitful cooperation in the trilateral format. I am happy to pass on the responsibilities of chair of the next meeting to our Chinese friends.
Thank you.
