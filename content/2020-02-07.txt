Russian-Belarusian talks continued with the participation of the delegations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We will continue our work as we agreed. This is the second half, to use a sports term, since we just played hockey.
In general, during the first part of our meeting we discussed in considerable detail the items on the agenda. Now we can clarify some issues in expanded format.
In addition, I would also like you to meet the new members of the Russian Government.
