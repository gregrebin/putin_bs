Meeting of the IX Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum.
The Forum’s main theme this year was innovation cooperation.
Twelve documents on cooperation in various areas were signed within the framework of the forum, in particular on prevention of industrial accidents, catastrophes and natural disasters, supplying crude oil and refined products to Kazakhstan, on the environment, energy, and car manufacturing. Bilateral documents between Russian and Kazakhstani regions were also signed.
Later, Vladimir Putin and Nursultan Nazarbayev made statements for the press.
The Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum has taken place annually, with the two countries alternating as hosts, starting from the first meeting in Omsk (Russia) in 2003.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues and friends,
I address my words to both delegations, the Russian and Kazakhstani delegations. Looking at Russia’s delegation, I see that there are many federal government ministers present, and also many regional governors. 
Kazakhstan is hosting the Forum for the fourth time now. The previous venues in Kazakhstan were Uralsk, Aktyubinsk and Ust-Kamenogorsk. The Russian Federation has hosted the event five times – in Omsk, Chelyabinsk, Novosibirsk, Orenburg and Astrakhan. The Forum is producing bigger practical results with each passing year. I think you see this for yourselves. When I meet with you in your regions – I mean my Russian colleagues – cooperation with Kazakhstan in various areas is always on the agenda, be it technical or industrial cooperation, work together on infrastructure – something always comes up. In other words, life itself obliges us to pay attention to these issues. If this is the case, then it is our duty to settle any problems that arise as swiftly and effectively as possible.

Today’s agenda is devoted to a particularly important and very topical issue – innovation cooperation. Our two countries’ regions have similar tasks to address. They include diversifying sources of economic growth, and keeping up the pace of economic growth, which, as we know, is a top priority for any country and for us too. Other priorities include infrastructure projects and the need to develop our scientific, technological, and investment potential. 
We have already established a decent foundation for interregional high-technology cooperation. Seventy six of Russia’s 83 regions have business contacts with partners in Kazakhstan. Most active among them are Moscow, Moscow Region, Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Orenburg, Novosibirsk and Kurgan regions, Altai and Krasnoyarsk territories, and the republics of Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Khakassia. More than 400 joint ventures operate in the border regions, and, as Mr Nazarbayev said before when we discussed bilateral and regional issues one-on-one, 600 companies are represented at the Forum today.
We want to see not only big companies play an active part in innovation cooperation, but small and medium-sized enterprises too. This is particularly important. The experts estimate that SMEs account for around 30–35 percent of all innovative products and services in developed economies. 
The machine-building sector is one of our priority areas for developing the use of new technology. As Mr Nazarbayev also mentioned just now, over the coming years we plan to build a full-cycle car plant in Kazakhstan. We are also interested in organising a joint business to assemble Ka-226T helicopters for civilian use. The Russian-Kazakhstani Nanotechnology Venture Fund has been established to encourage innovation cooperation. These are just some of the bigger joint projects. Of course, as Mr Nazarbayev also mentioned, we also continue our work together in the space sector through the world-famous Baikonur space launch centre.
Carrying out these programmes will help us to maintain the existing links and fine-tune new industrial links, and this will increase the scale and quality of industrial cooperation between our countries and business partners.
Making use of innovative solutions and technology will make our transport systems vastly more reliable and effective. For neighbours such as us, with a common border stretching over almost 7,000 kilometres (the longest land border in the world), this is an absolutely top priority, above all so as to establish the Europe-Western China transit corridor. This route will run from St Petersburg through Kazan, Orenburg, Aktyubinsk and Almaty to the border with China, and will not only bring a huge improvement to the transport infrastructure in Russia and Kazakhstan, but will open shorter and more profitable routes for trade between Europe and the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region.
Of course, innovation is above all about new ideas and bold and creative solutions, and so we need to make full use of our countries’ scientific and educational potential. The achievements of our countries’ universities and research centres are well known. What’s more, many of them have been working productively together for a long time now. In May this year, Omsk hosted the second forum of universities from the Russian and Kazakhstani border regions, with 25 universities taking part.
Friends,
The Customs Union and the Common Economic Space open up broad new opportunities for developing bilateral cooperation, placing in our hands a huge market of 165 million consumers. This chance to harmonise our legislation and ensure free movement of people, capital, goods, and labour will play a crucial part in making our countries more competitive.
We hope that the Russian and Kazakhstani regions will make the fullest possible use of these opportunities and the new development possibilities, in order to achieve a real breakthrough in carrying out the long-term projects of such importance for both countries.
I wish you success. Thank you for your attention.

President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Mr President, welcome to Kazakhstan.
This is now the ninth time we are holding this interregional forum, which offers an effective platform for developing our countries’ trade and economic relations.
Today’s theme is innovation cooperation. Pavlodar is hosting a big exhibition where 600 companies from Russian and Kazakhstani regions are demonstrating their innovation achievements. Also underway is a business forum, which will see the signing today of 27 contracts worth a total of more than $2 billion.
The Customs Union and the Common Economic Space are achieving their objective of developing trade between our countries. Of course, we are still at the polishing stage and have yet to iron out all of the problems, but we are working precisely so as to complete this process. 
As we agreed, I hope to meet with you in October to revise our framework agreement. The 20 years of cooperation between Kazakhstan and Russia have been an excellent example of how neighbours should work together. I think that we should mark these two decades at our October meeting and outline our plans and goals for the future.
I wish you welcome. The forum is ready to begin. I think we will make it a success.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr President.
Regional cooperation is a key issue. Of Russia’s 83 regions, close to 80 – 75 or 79 – have direct ties with Kazakhstan. The trade volume is increasing all the time, and we know that people always find it easier to reach agreements directly in this way, especially in neighbouring regions, because they are more familiar with each other’s possibilities and needs. This explains why interregional trade is growing steadily. These regions are always sending signals too about what we can and should do at the government level to improve conditions for cooperation, particularly in the economy, but also in humanitarian and cultural ties and contact between people. This is all extremely important, of course.
I think this Forum, which you initiated, has played a very big part precisely in our successful establishment of the Customs Union and Common Economic Space. The national agreements we concluded are now working so effectively because of the signals that we got directly from people on the ground. 
I am very pleased to have this chance to meet with you, see how our colleagues are working, listen to what they have to say, and discuss our future prospects with them.

Press statements following Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum. With President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to once again welcome the President of Russia, all of our Russian friends and the Russian delegation to Pavlodar, where we are holding our annual Forum of our nation’s regions.
We held the IX Interregional Cooperation Forum, which focused on Innovation Cooperation, in one of Kazakhstan’s largest industrial centres, the city of Pavlodar. Choosing this city was no accident: neighbouring states account for up to 70 percent of trade turnover in Pavlodar Region. This region generates 40 percent of our nation’s electric power and produces 100 percent of its metallic aluminium; it also has well-developed chemical and agricultural sectors. The expansion of Ekibastuz GRES-2 power station, which is a joint venture with Russia with an investment volume of one billion dollars, and launching the third power generating unit – all this is very important and necessary for our nation. The electricity generated is used both by Russia and by Kazakhstan.
I am pleased to note that we are gradually developing trade between our nations: in the last year, turnover grew by 30 percent to constitute more than $23 billion, and in the first half of this year it exceeded $11 billion. More than 20 business agreements were signed within the framework of this forum worth a total of approximately $2 billion.
In a separate meeting with President of the Russian Federation Mr Putin, we discussed the upcoming events marking the 20th anniversary of the Treaty between Kazakhstan and Russia on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our nations.
During the talks, we addressed cooperation in space exploration, joint use of the Baikonur space launch facility, rational use of water resources, and protecting trans-border rivers. We also looked into problems of industrial and innovative interregional development and efficient cooperation in the fuel and energy sector.
We are consistently strengthening Russia and Kazakhstan’s cooperation within the framework of the Common Economic Space and the Customs Union. Today, we have eliminated many customs barriers that existed between our nations at the boarders, and this is helping us actively develop joint production projects. I feel that this union will be quite attractive to many nations around the world in the future.
I will take this opportunity to congratulate the Russian side on its accession to the World Trade Organisation. We are striving to do the same, and in accordance with our agreements, we will be joining it with Russia’s support.
Several agreements were signed in our presence today aimed at deepening bilateral relations in various sectors of our economies.
In conclusion, I want to once again thank you, Mr President, as well as our Russian friends, for participating in this Forum. I am sure that the agreements reached here will help to develop and further strengthen partner relations between our nations and serve for the good of our peoples and our nations.
The next, tenth Forum will be held in Russia. We agreed with Russia’s suggestion to hold it in Yekaterinburg.
”The Forum’s outcomes deserve the highest assessment. What’s most important is that they are aimed at providing for the basic needs and improving the quality of life for our people, the citizens of our nations.“
Thank you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: This year is a special year in Russian-Kazakhstani relations: we are marking the 20th anniversary of the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, as well as the 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations. By historic measurements, this is a fairly short period, but in this time, we have been able to achieve a great deal. We have laid a strong foundation for our relations, which have been progressing to this day – and, I hope, will continue to do so in the future – in the spirit of strategic partnership and cooperation.
We have created and are constantly improving our extensive contractual legal framework, and we are constantly maintaining intensive business and political contacts at all levels.
As you know, the theme of the IX Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum is Innovative Cooperation. This is a particularly important area in our joint work. Innovative development and diversification of our economy are strategic directions for the Russian economy (as I’m sure members of the press are aware), but they are no less important for Kazakhstan as well. And if we join forces to resolve certain problems, we can do it more efficiently. That is precisely the goal of creating the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space.
We are really increasing our common competitiveness. I have already told Mr Nazarbayev this, and I can say it again: at the recent APEC summit in Vladivostok, many of our partners from this highly promising and successfully-developing region of the world gave a lot of attention to our Customs Union and Common Economic Space. And in my bilateral meetings, I was almost always asked about how our work is organised. Many of our partners in the Asia-Pacific region expressed a clear desire to create direct contacts and establish special relations with the Common Economic Space and the Customs Union. This is promising work, especially since we plan to continue improving our integration cooperation, up to the point of creating a Eurasian Economic Union.
Today, Mr Nazarbayev and I discussed cooperation in the monetary and financial sector. The President of Kazakhstan raised these issues, meaning that for our national currencies’ fluctuations we need to develop a mechanism that will help us maintain our competitiveness, that will not allow any blunders or losses for our economies and for specific companies engaged in economic activity.
”Many of our partners in the Asia-Pacific region expressed a clear desire to create direct contacts and establish special relations with the Common Economic Space and the Customs Union.“
Incidentally, I can tell you that a deal was made by one of Russia’s largest banks, Sberbank, to sell a 7.58-percent stake for $5,208 billion. This is one of the most profitable deals of the last decade in this area, following Apple. For every $100 invested in Sberbank ten years ago, its major shareholder – the Central Bank of the Russian Federation – got $3,700 today. That’s $3,700 dollars for every $100 invested ten years ago. This is a very good profitability level and it speaks to the potential of Russia’s credit financial institutions, the appeal of those credit financial institutions and the opportunity to broaden our joint work in this direction.
Participants in the Forum came up with a whole range of very interesting and promising ideas, including in the SME sector. And naturally, financial support in this area is very much needed.
During the Forum, we signed a whole package of bilateral agreements. Mr Nazarbayev mentioned this, and you saw it all for yourselves.
The Forum’s outcomes deserve the highest assessment. What’s most important is that they are aimed at providing for the basic needs and improving the quality of life for our people, the citizens of our nations, who reside in near-border regions on both sides.
Mr Nazarbayev and I had our bilateral meeting, which the President of Kazakhstan spoke about. We had the chance to discuss the full range of bilateral relations, the situation in the region and in the world overall. We spoke about the most pressing problems that certain nations are facing today. Many of these things directly affect the interests of both Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.
In conclusion, I would also like to thank the residents of Pavlodar and, of course, the Kazakhstani leadership and President Nazarbayev for making it possible for us to meet today under such good conditions and have the opportunity to discuss the problems that are of interest to us and whose resolution will determine the quality of life for our citizens. Thank you very much.
Thank you for your attention.
