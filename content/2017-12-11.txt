At the Khmeimim air base in Syria. With the Russian and Syrian military who took part in the counterterrorism operation.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, comrades.
It is good to see you in a less formal setting, not in formation. I want to thank you again for what you did here in Syria, both directly and in contact with your Syrian comrades in arms.
I understand this is one of them, General Suheil al-Hassan. I have just talked with President Assad, and your Russian colleagues said the same – that you and your service members are fighting very resolutely, bravely and effectively. I hope this interaction will continue to bring us success.
I understand there are pilots here as well.
Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu
: General Ivanayev …
Vladimir Putin: He was wounded and removed from the battlefield?
Are our pilots here?
Sr Lieutenant A. Vedyashchev: Yes, Sr Lieutenant Vedyashchev.
Vladimir Putin: What unit are you from?
Sr Lieutenant A. Vedyashchev: Central District.
Vladimir Putin: How long have you been here?
Sr Lieutenant A. Vedyashchev: About two months – August and September.
Vladimir Putin: I was shown the results of your work in combat. Good job.
Sr Lieutenant A. Vedyashchev: I serve the Russian Federation!
Vladimir Putin: Congratulations.
As we said before, I am confident that you can confirm that participation in combat operations dramatically increases the level of professional skills.
Sr Lieutenant A. Vedyashchev: That is affirmative. The training range is for learning things. Here, it is real work, and the experience that you gain while doing actual work cannot be obtained in civilian life.
Vladimir Putin: True. At a training range, you only shoot at targets, but here you are targets as well. It is a big difference.
Deputy Commander D. Klimenko: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Deputy Commander of the Euphrates Group in charge of fire damage. Missile forces and artillery.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, perhaps, most importantly, you are right, we are testing weapons here, and many weapons really have been tested.
But this is not the most important thing. The army and its officers, sergeants, and troops are the most important asset of the state and its Armed Forces.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, our achievements here have reinforced the belief of the soldiers, sergeants and officers in our victory under your guidance.
Vladimir Putin: And they have attained this victory.
Dmitry Klimenko: Yes, sir, and this may be the most important thing. Equipment comes second after people.
Vladimir Putin: Equipment is important, and you must know how to use it. Am I right, Mr Mamatov?
Yusup Mamatov: Yusup Mamatov, deputy battalion Commander, military police.
Vladimir Putin: Was it you who broke out of an encirclement?
Yusup Mamatov: Yes, sir. A combined military police platoon was monitoring the ceasefire. On September 19, when we came under mortar fire, we assumed a perimeter position in accordance with our combat duty assignment and indicated our positions by hoisting a Russian flag so that our pilots would see it.
Our assault planes delivered a crushing blow to the terrorists, who sustained heavy losses. They pulled back, opening a gap, which I decided to use.
We moved at top speed towards Hama, where our troops were deployed. Soon we saw an evacuation team in armoured vehicles moving under protection of combat helicopters. They helped us to leave the zone of hostilities without suffering a single loss. This is how we reached our deployment area.
Vladimir Putin: Good job.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: These are our medics, a field team.
Tatyana Kovalyova: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Nurse Kovalyova, senior nurse at the medical team.
We have been sent here to provide humanitarian and medical assistance to the civilian population of Syria. We went to the suburbs of Homs and Latakia to give medical treatment to the people.
Of course, it breaks your heart when you see children with old blast injuries. But their spiritual suffering was even more horrible than their wounds.
It was frightening, but we did our job; we helped the local people. They are very grateful to us.
Vladimir Putin: How many people have you helped at your hospital?
Tatyana Kovalyova: Ours is a mobile team, and so we have helped some 5,000 people during our stay here, during three months.
Sergei Shoigu: Overall, we have helped nearly 57,000 people.
Vladimir Putin: How many people worked at the hospital?
Tatyana Kovalyova: We had two or at most three teams of doctors and nurses who worked with the Centre for Reconciliation. But usually one or two teams comprising a doctor and a nurse worked with the centre.
Vladimir Putin: Did you have the necessary medicines and equipment?
Tatyana Kovalyova: We brought along everything we needed, set up in a suitable building or put up a tent and provided medical assistance. We had all the necessary equipment, and we provided quality assistance.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Sergei Shoigu: Bomb disposal squads have also done very well.
Artyom Rubanov: Sergeant Rubanov, International Anti-Mine Centre of the Russian Armed Forces.
This is our fourth mission here.
I apologise, I am a little nervous.
Vladimir Putin: No problem. He does not get nervous when he is de-mining but now he is. (Laughter.)
Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, this sergeant personally defused 1,800 mines and explosive devices with his own hands.
Vladimir Putin: How many?
Sergei Shoigu: 1,800.
Artyom Rubanov: More than 1,500. I do not count them, sir.
This is my third tour of duty. I have been to Palmyra, Aleppo, and now Deir ez-Zor. I have already said how many mines have been defused.
Vladimir Putin: Where did you learn to do it?
Artyom Rubanov: At the International Anti-Mine Centre.
Vladimir Putin: How long did the training take?
Artyom Rubanov: We have training every day. Everything is great. We study explosive hazard and improvised explosive devices. Plenty of improvised and bizarre bombs are found here, sometimes what you would never expect to see.
My most memorable incident took place during my first tour, in Palmyra, as we were de-mining the historical part of the city. We were on an engineer reconnaissance mission in a palace. We discovered a well and decided to go down there.
As I was getting down, it felt quite eerie. The well was 20 to 25 metres deep. At the bottom, we found a tunnel, with a tripwire mine stretched across the entrance.
I removed the tripwire and started moving forward where I found a large cache of explosives and ammunition. We decided to destroy them all, which I did.
This was perhaps my most memorable task here. Must be because it happened during my first tour.
Vladimir Putin: Did the tunnel collapse?
Artyom Rubanov: Nothing was left of it.
Vladimir Putin: Was there a lot of ammunition?
Artyom Rubanov: Quite a lot, sir. I cannot tell you the exact number but there were many explosives.
Vladimir Putin: How many people are working with you on the ground?
Artyom Rubanov: With me personally?
Vladimir Putin: Yes.
Artyom Rubanov: Eleven people in my division. Three teams. We travel on assignments in three teams.
Vladimir Putin: Please send my regards to them.
Artyom Rubanov: Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: No, thank you.
Andrei Medvedev: Deputy Commander of the Special Operations Squad, Lieutenant-Commander Medvedev. We have been on tour since September, and were deployed to a number of regions. The active phase of the offensive against Al-Qaryatayn was especially memorable for us.
Our team was tasked with observing the enemy and directing air support. However, it so happened that at the same time government troops were on the offensive, so we just used this opportunity to support our comrades. As a result, our team destroyed about 50 fighters driving pick-up trucks equipped with anti-aircraft mounts.
When the enemy retreated from its positions, and the government troops took them, observers noted that many vehicles were converging in one place as they retreated. Using technical reconnaissance equipment, we identified their location and signalled it to the air forces.
Let me say that the air force was very prompt and worked very well in conducting highly efficient strikes.
Vladimir Putin: Did they hit all the targets?
Andrei Medvedev: Yes, sir!
Vladimir Putin: Way to go.
Ruslan Zabirov: Operator pilot of a Mi-35 helicopter. This is my second assignment here. I have about 150–180 combat flights. We operated from Shayrat Airbase, Tiyas Military Airbase, Deir ez-Zor Airport and Khmeimim air base.
The most memorable moment was when we were tasked at the Shayrat Airbase to help government troops seize dominant terrain near Palmyra. We left with two Mi-35s followed by a Mi-8.
When we arrived, we saw the fighters from afar, and took out two antiaircraft mounts right away, striking at the fighters with unguided missiles.
We then started turning left towards the airfield. There was dust there after the shelling. Suddenly, we noticed two more anti-aircraft mounts that tried to hit us. We turned back, got them and left for the airfield.
Vladimir Putin: Left for the airfield. (Laughter) You say this so casually, as if you left on a taxi.
Ruslan Zabirov: You just get used to this kind of thing.
Vladimir Putin: It is true, but you still have to be cautious. The work you do is very challenging, especially for helicopters. Thank you all once again.
President of Syria Bashar al-Assad
(re-translated): I would like to thank all of you for your work and the excellent cohesion of Russian and Syrian service members. We have been shedding our blood for five or six years already.
Moreover, our unity is manifested not only in combat action. We have a large number of mixed families. Their children live both in Syria and Russia. They are closely intertwined culturally and socially.
Briefly put, our blood was intertwined in families several decades ago when they had children.
Now blood has brought us together for a different reason. We are shedding our fraternal blood for a good cause.
The blood we have been forced to shed is much more powerful in all respects than the blood that is spilled by terrorists under our onslaught.
Several days before the liberation of Abu Kamal, I had a telephone conversation with Brigadier General Suheil at the time when he and his servicemen were attacked by ISIS that sent several cars stuffed with explosives against them.
On that day, these mobile jihads killed about 60 of his people. He lost about the same number of people on each of the two previous days.
But this blood that was shed by his soldiers liberated Deir ez-Zor and Abu Kamal and all other cities of the eastern zone. We do not differentiate whose blood it was – Russian or Syrian. This does not matter at all.
I am sure that in a hundred years or less our grandchildren and great grandchildren will study our history and the exploits of Russian and Syrian warriors to the same extent both in Russian and Syrian schools.
This victory and your visit, Mr Vladimir Putin, fill me with personal pride. I am so glad about your visit, your first visit to Syria and for this very reason. This is a great honour for me.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I would like to wish all of you success.
The Defence Minister reported to me on this heavy fighting and the losses we have just spoken about.
Bashar al-Assad: You should know that General Suheil al-Hassan does not see his family at all. He has been living on the battlefield for several years now.
Vladimir Putin: You should see them.
Suheil Salman al-Hassan: (re-translated): Hopefully after the victory.
Vladimir Putin: I wish you success and want to thank all of you once again. Our holiday, the New Year, is approaching. Have a happy New Year. I would like to wish happiness to you and your families and friends.

Once again, welcome. We also welcome the accompanying members of your delegation. All of Egypt and the Egyptian people welcome you as well.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, thank you very much for the invitation.
I am pleased to note that our economic ties are developing at a fairly fast pace. Indeed, we have many good projects coming up, including the nuclear power plant project, the construction of a technological platform, and agriculture.
Of course, I would very much like to discuss with you the situation in the region. For my part, I am ready to talk to you in detail about the situation in Syria.
I arrived here directly from Syria and would like to inform you in detail about my conversation with President al-Assad, as well as our arrangements with the leaders of Turkey and Iran regarding further steps towards a political settlement in Syria.

Press statements following Russian-Egyptian talks. With President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (retranslated): Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to begin by greeting His Excellency, President Vladimir Putin, a friend of Egypt whose presence here today is evidence of solid strategic relations between Egypt and the Russian Federation.
Strong ties between our countries date back in history and are based on bilateral political relations, coordinated positions on the regional and international stages, as well as our economic ties, which began with the construction of the Aswan Dam in southern Egypt and an iron and steel plant. Today we have signed a contract for the construction of a nuclear power plant in Egypt.
Egypt has always regarded Russia as a strategic partner and an ally in all spheres. Relations between our countries developed over centuries, which was reflected in our talks with President Vladimir Putin today.
We pointed out that relations between Egypt and the Russian Federation are strong and that they continue to grow, as evidenced by our joint ventures, mutual trade and the attraction of investment.
We are aware of the importance of attracting Russian investment to Egypt through the establishment of a Russian industrial area on the Suez Canal. We have issued instructions to the concerned ministries and agencies to settle all possible problems so as to promote bilateral cooperation in the spirit of coordination reached at the talks on the construction of Egypt’s first nuclear power plant.
Ladies and gentlemen, seeking to achieve a bright future for our nations, we have coordinated our views on the regional agenda. Today we discussed issues related to our countries’ national security.
The main goal for Egypt and Russia is to ensure stability and peace in our region, in the Middle East, in order to create a better future for future generations. In this context, we discussed the Palestinian issue following the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
We also discussed the possible consequences of this serious and dangerous decision for stability and a settlement of the conflict. We also expressed confidence that Jerusalem’s legal status must be determined on the basis of international law and the relevant UN decisions, which must not complicate the situation in the region.
Your Excellency Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
The Palestinian issue was at the top of our agenda today. We appreciate Russia’s efforts towards a peaceful and political settlement of this problem, as well as the efforts of the four-party commission on Palestine. We highly value your efforts towards a fair settlement of the oldest conflict in the region, which is still waiting for a just settlement.
Today we also spoke about the situation in Syria and Libya. We focused on the importance of a peaceful and political solution to these issues.
As for Syria, our positions coincided regarding what is called the de-escalation zone in Syria. We believe we must expand these zones to create appropriate conditions for a further peace process and negotiations between all religious and political groups in Syria.
In this context, we highly appreciated all successful efforts to form a unified delegation representing all opposition groups in coordination with the UN envoy to the regions, to achieve a political settlement that would meet the expectations of the Syrian people and preserve the country’s territorial integrity and unity.
Concerning Libya, we have voiced our decision to combine international efforts to regulate and lessen the instability in Libya in a political way; we support all the efforts of the UN envoy to that region at the next phase that should follow the transition period.
We also support holding parliamentary and presidential elections in that country to stabilise it, and the unification of military forces in Libya. I confirmed this at yesterday’s meeting with Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya Fayez Al-Sarraj.
Mr Putin and I both emphasised the exchange of intelligence information between the competent authorities in both countries to fight terrorism and destabilisation, especially because most of the militants are now moving from these hot spots in the Middle East and attacking other places in the region. We also support and urge all states to prevent them from moving to other states.
Your Excellency Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
We note the strength of relations today between Egypt and the Russian Federation. Once again, we welcome you here on behalf of the entire Egyptian people.
We focus on building up our strategic relations and partnership in all areas.
Thank you. I will now give the floor to President Putin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to begin by thanking the President of Egypt and all our Egyptian colleagues for the warm and heartfelt welcome.
Mr el-Sisi and I had very informative and constructive talks both during our limited attendance meeting and with the involvement of delegation participants, and outlined our cooperation plans for the future.
We discussed the most pressing issues on the international and regional agendas.
Russia has always put special emphasis on developing friendly and mutually beneficial ties with Egypt, our long-term and reliable partner in the Middle East and North Africa.
Bilateral cooperation is picking up pace and acquiring a new quality.
This is largely due to expanded trade and economic cooperation. Today, we noted with satisfaction that mutual trade is up 50 percent at over $4 billion as of the end of the first nine months of 2017. We noted the importance of continuing talks on creating a free trade area between Egypt and the Eurasian Economic Union.
We focused particularly on our joint work in the energy sector, including hydrocarbons and the construction of the first in Egypt El-Dabaa nuclear power plant. Once the construction is completed, Egypt will have not just a nuclear power plant, but access to the latest safe technologies as well.
We also considered another promising project, which is to build a Russian industrial zone in Egypt. We believe that it will become a major regional centre for producing and exporting Russian-made goods to the markets of the Middle East and Africa. Russia’s leading companies are already showing an interest in this project. The total investment in the project is projected at $7 billion.
We discussed interaction in agriculture. Egypt is one of the main buyers of Russian wheat. About 5.5 million tonnes of grain have already been delivered to Egypt over the past three quarters. We are ready to continue to meet the Egyptian market’s need for grain in the future.
We agreed to expand ties in the military and military-technical spheres, primarily in order to strengthen the antiterrorist potential of the armed forces of Egypt.
Of course, we could not ignore tourism. Direct air travel between our countries was suspended in the wake of the terrible tragedy in the skies over Sinai in October 2015.
Egypt used this time to do a fair amount of work to tighten airport security. The President and I discussed the sequence of future joint steps designed to resume direct air service.
The Russian security services reported to me that we are overall ready to re-open direct air service between Moscow and Cairo. We will need to sign a corresponding intergovernmental protocol. We will see to it that it is signed shortly.
We had an in-depth exchange of opinions on the major international issues. Our approaches are either very close or completely the same.
I informed the President of the steps Russia is taking to stabilise the situation in Syria. I also spoke about the results of my visit to Syria today.
As you may know, with the support of the Russian Aerospace Forces, Syrian territory has been almost entirely liberated from terrorists. I believe the tasks that were to be tackled with an extensive involvement of the Russian Armed Forces have been mostly completed. Mr Sisi and I agreed to intensify our coordination to facilitate the long-term political settlement of the Syrian crisis.
We appreciate our Egyptian partners’ support of Russia’s initiative to organise the Syrian National Dialogue Congress. We plan to involve various oppositional groups in the Congress, including members of the Moscow and Cairo groups.
Russia and Egypt are also interested in ensuring stability and security in Libya, in restoring its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.
We value Egypt’s constructive approach to the Middle East settlement process. We welcome the agreement that was signed here, in Cairo, between Fatah and Hamas last October, aimed at strengthening intra-Palestinian unity.
Our countries both speak in favour of the soonest possible resumption of direct Palestine-Israel dialogue on all matters of dispute, including the status of Jerusalem. It is necessary to reach long-term and fair agreements that would serve the interests of both sides.
And of course, these agreements must correspond with the earlier decisions of the international community. Russia fully supports all the UN Security Council resolutions on the issue.
We believe that any steps that run ahead of the outcome of the dialogue between the Palestinians and the Israeli are counter-productive. Such steps destabilise the situation rather than resolve it.
Finally, I would like to thank our Egyptian friends for our productive work together. I am certain that implementation of today’s decisions will benefit the further comprehensive development of the partnership between Russia and Egypt.
Thank you very much.

Meeting with President of Syria Bashar al-Assad
Vladimir Putin met with President of Syria Bashar al-Assad while on a tour of the Russian airbase at Khmeimim. The two leaders discussed the outcome of the counterterrorism operations in Syria.
December 11, 2017

Syria
With President of the Syrian Arab Republic Bashar al-Assad.
Vladimir Putin commended the results of the counterterrorism operations in Syria. “This is important for both Syria and Russia, as well as for the rest of the world,” the Russian President said.
He also expressed readiness to work with Turkey and Iran to help restore peace in Syria.
President of Syria Bashar al-Assad
(re-translated): It is good to see you, Mr President.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I believe I promised that I would come. It is good that we are meeting in such circumstances where we have things to celebrate. I am referring to the outcome of our joint work.
Bashar al-Assad: Of course, these achievements and victories are very important to us. The very theme of our meeting today – the destruction of ISIS militants – is important for the entire world and makes it clear to the entire world that the states that are willing to fight ISIS, the very virus of radical terrorism, are up to the task.
For my part, I express my deep gratitude to you – on behalf of the people of the Syrian Arab Republic – for the role played by your Armed Forces.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
This is, indeed, a meaningful outcome of our joint work. True, the threat of terrorism remains high. But the fact that we defeated ISIS, one of the main terrorist groups, here in Syria is extremely important for Syria, Russia, and the entire world.
I hope that in conjunction with Iran and Turkey, as well as the countries contributing to the eradication of terrorism, we will go beyond just restoring peaceful life and put in place a political process to resolve the situation in Syria in general. We will manage to prepare for the Syrian National Congress, which we discussed in Sochi, and to launch the peaceful settlement process.
I will have an opportunity to discuss this with the President of Egypt in Cairo and a little later with the President of Turkey. We will contact you following these talks, and I will inform you in detail about our common plans for achieving a final settlement.
Bashar al-Assad: I believe your planned visits focus on further fighting and destroying international terrorism and, at the same time, beginning the process of a peaceful settlement in Syria.
The victories that have been achieved will affect not only our state, but also all our neighbouring states, so clearly the issues discussed in this format are important for the entire region.
Vladimir Putin: Exactly so, I agree.

At the Khmeimim air base in Syria.
At the air base, Vladimir Putin was met by President of the Syrian Arab Republic Bashar al-Assad
, Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu
and Commander of the Russian military group Sergei Surovikin.
The Commander-in-Chief ordered the withdrawal of the Russian military group from Syria back to their permanent bases.
Vladimir Putin thanked the Russian service personnel who took part in the counter-terrorism operation in Syria and who made the operation a success.
The Russian head of State and President of Syria Bashar al-Assad also met with Russian officers and heard a report by the Commander of the Russian group of forces in Syria on the operations to liberate the country from terrorists. Vladimir Putin used this opportunity to thank the Russian military pilots who will be returning home today.

Speech at the Khmeimim air base
Russian President Vladimir Putin: Hello, comrades.
The most important thing for a military person – and we are very much aware of this – is the defence of our Fatherland, our people. This is not just the purpose of military service, but also the purpose of life for those who have devoted themselves to serving their people.
At the same time, a soldier is truly tested for loyalty to the Fatherland in a military operation fraught with huge risks to life and health. Here, in Syria, far from home, you are doing exactly that – you are protecting our country.
By helping the people of Syria to maintain their statehood, to fight off attacks by terrorists, you have inflicted a devastating blow to those who have directly, brazenly and openly threatened our country.
We will never forget the sacrifices and losses incurred in the struggle against terrorism both here in Syria and in Russia. However, it will not make us fold our hands and retreat. This is not in our peoples’ nature.
On the contrary, this memory will continue to motivate us to eradicate this absolute evil – terrorism – whatever face it hides behind.
Yes, the threat of terrorism around the world is still very high. However, the task of combating the armed groups here in Syria, the goal that needed to be addressed with the help of the large-scale use of the armed forces, has been largely resolved – and brilliantly resolved. Congratulations!
Our Armed Forces and our defence contractors have shown the growing power of the Russian Army and Navy, and the high combat capability of the various military units.
Pilots, sailors, members of special forces, reconnaissance, troop-control and logistic support units, military police, medical personnel, field engineers and advisers working in the battle units of the Syrian Army have displayed the best qualities of Russian soldiers, such as courage, heroism, combat cohesion, determination, as well as excellent training and professionalism.
The Homeland is proud of you. I am convinced that you will always faithfully serve the Fatherland, defend and uphold our national interests, our country and its people.
Syria has been preserved as a sovereign and independent state. Refugees are returning to their homes. Favourable conditions have been created for a political settlement under the UN. The Russian Centre for the reconciliation of opposing sides in Syria continues to operate in line with international agreements.
The two bases, in Tartous and Khmeimim, will continue to operate on a permanent basis. If the terrorists raise their heads again, we will deal unprecedented strikes unlike anything they have seen.
In just over two years, the Russian Armed Forces and the Syrian Army have defeated the most combat-ready group of international terrorists. In this connection, I have decided to redeploy most of the Russian military contingent from the Syrian Arab Republic to Russia.
You are returning victorious to your homes, your families, parents, wives, children and friends.
I hereby order the Defence Minister and the General Chief of Staff to start redeploying units of the Russian army group to their permanent bases.
The Homeland is waiting for you, friends. Godspeed! Thank you for your service.
