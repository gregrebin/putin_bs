President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: We have gathered here to hold a working meeting of the permanent members of the Security Council.
But before we begin I would like to say a few words in connection with the events that occurred recently in Ingushetia. After the terrorist attack on the President of the Republic of Ingushetia the situation there has naturally become more difficult, and I have instructed the heads of special services who are here today, the Interior Minister and Prosecutor General to maintain the rule of law and conduct the necessary investigations.
I would like you to report on what has been done, what has been achieved, what the main viewpoints are, and how we plan to respond appropriately in the near future. I have already discussed this during a meeting with some of you and with the President of the Chechen Republic. There should be no beating around the bush, we must act. We have already responded and operations are continuing. I want to know how many gunmen have been killed. Of course we will be discussing other issues that are part of our agenda for today, but first and foremost I would like to focus on this topic. At our recent meeting in Daghestan we laid out a wide range of solutions to these problems. All of these solutions must be implemented, including those specific instructions that I have given colleagues who are here today.
Let's get down to work. Thank you.
