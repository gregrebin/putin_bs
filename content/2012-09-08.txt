With Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
The Russian President and Canadian Prime Minister discussed the development of bilateral relations in various fields, including cooperation in developing the Arctic.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends,
We are very happy to see you here in Vladivostok. We have good experience in cooperating on both a personal level and an interstate level.
Naturally, I would like to begin by talking about the economy: since 2000, we have increased our trade turnover eight-fold, but unfortunately, the absolute values remain very low. Meanwhile, we have very significant opportunities. In my view, we are not taking sufficient advantage of them, although there are certain interesting areas, there are leaders in cooperation on both the Russian and Canadian side. I think that our challenge is to support them and find new promising areas for cooperation.
In addition, there is a great deal of interest in joint work in the Arctic. I hope that we will be able to work very effectively in the near future within the framework of the structures that have been created, with the prospects that our experts and specialists are proposing.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper: Thank you, Mr President, for your welcome and for holding this summit in this beautiful region of your nation.
This year, we are marking not only the 70th year of our bilateral relations between our countries, but also the 40th anniversary of the great Summit Series that, in many ways, is the beginning of the modern era of our cultural relations, so it’s a great time for me to be here.

Also, Mr President, I want to congratulate you and your country on your accession to the World Trade Organisation. I know that this is one of a series of important events for Russia – the holding of this summit, the holding of the Olympics, and also, of course, your accession to the World Trade Organisation, which I think, more than ever, will provide great economic opportunities to be explored between our two countries.
You are correct in observing that although our economic relations continue to expand, we have not in any way seen the potential of those come to pass yet, so you and I will talk about what we can do to further those relations, as well as a range of other issues. We will obviously be talking about international peace and security issues and some of the common challenges and experiences that we share as Arctic nations.
So once again, thank you for hosting me and I look forward to our discussions here.
Vladimir Putin: I had the pleasure of meeting with several of your outstanding hockey players. I must say that they are certainly ambassadors to the world in the broadest and most direct sense of this word.
I would like to ask you to pass on my words of gratitude to them for coming to Russia and playing a match against our hockey veterans yesterday in the city of Yaroslavl, where a terrible tragedy took place one year ago and an entire hockey team was killed.
As for sports, you know that we are preparing for the Olympic Games in 2014 and Canadian companies are also participating very actively in the work to prepare for this event.

With President of the Republic of Peru Ollanta Humala.
The heads of state discussed the prospects of further developing their countries’ economic, scientific, technical, cultural and humanitarian relations.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are happy to welcome you to Russia, here in the Far East, in Vladivostok.
I know that you have visited other Russian cities – I believe you went to Kazan and Irkutsk. I hope that this will not be your last visit to Russia, especially since we have much work to do together.
Unfortunately, our trade turnover is lower than we might like, but nevertheless, last year, we observed measurable growth. There are interesting potential areas for collaboration, including energy, fishing, military technical cooperation and education.
About 89 Peruvian students study at our universities, and we have agreed on the training for over two hundred service members at the Russian Defence Ministry’s military schools and academies.
Relations between our nations have deep roots and are currently based on the agreement of 2006.
Mr President, we are very happy to see you.
President of The Republic of Peru Ollanta Humala (retranslated): Mr President,
For my part, I would like to congratulate you on your inauguration.
It is a great honour and a pleasure for us to be present here at this summit, to strengthen and deepen our mutual relations. And we have the opportunity to take the relations between our two nations to a qualitatively new level.With President of the Republic of Chile Sebastian Pinera.
The two leaders discussed expanding trade and economic cooperation between their countries.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are very happy to see you and have the opportunity to meet on the sidelines of the APEC summit to talk about our bilateral relations.
Some time ago, we signed a partnership agreement and we are building our relations, our cooperation, within the framework of that document. I must say that we have positive momentum in our trade and economic ties, although the absolute values, unfortunately, are still nothing to brag about.
I very much hope that today’s meeting and subsequent contacts, particularly at the ministerial and expert level, will allow us to find additional directions for collaboration and take our cooperation to a higher level. I am certain that the fulfilment of the agreements we are reaching within the framework of such broad, general forums as APEC will promote this.
President of The Republic of Chile Sebastian Pinera (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. First of all, I would like to thank you for the excellent organisation of the APEC summit and the fact that it is happening in such a wonderful place, within the walls of Far East [Federal] University.
I wanted to say three things. First, I wanted to invite you to participate in the EU-LAC Summit, which will be held in Santiago de Chile at the end of January, when it will be summertime in our nation, and take this opportunity to visit Chile and Russia’s Antarctic bases.

Vladimir Putin: That’s a great suggestion.
Sebastian Pinera: A second idea I think you will find interesting is the need to intensify our trade relations, given the momentum in their development. We need to think about the possibility of developing agreements on free trade not only with Russia but also with its partners, Belarus and Kazakhstan. And based on that agreement, to increase not just turnover, not just the exchange of goods and services, but also the volume of mutual investment between Russia and Chile.
And finally, the third thing I wanted to say is that this year, we participated in the G20 summit that was held in Los Cabos on Mexico’s invitation; next year, as you know, the summit will be held in Russia, so it would also be a great privilege and honour for us to participate in that summit.
Vladimir Putin: That is what we will do, Mr President.Events

With Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.
Trade and economic relations between the two countries were discussed. After the meeting, the following agreements were signed in the presence of President Putin and Prime Minister Noda: an agreement on maintaining, rational use, and management of bioresources in the northwestern Pacific and the prevention of their illegal trade, a memorandum of understanding between Gazprom and the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy on the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in Vladivostok, and a contract to build a paper pulp plant in Krasnoyarsk Territory.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
We are very happy to see you in Russia, this time in Vladivostok.
I am very pleased that we have established regular business contacts at practically every level, including at the political level. We met a short time ago in Los Cabos and now we have the opportunity to meet here in Russia. Just recently, I had the pleasure of meeting with your Foreign Minister on Sochi.
We have noted the growth in our turnover – last year, it was $30 billion. Today, we will take another step on the path to strengthening our trade and economic relations – I am referring to signing the agreement on energy and building a chemical enterprise on Russia’s territory with Japanese participation.
We are developing cooperation in the automotive industry; we are pleased to note the introduction of Japanese automakers on the Russian market, including here in the Far East.
Another issue is the fight against poaching. We agreed in Los Cabos that we would take serious steps in this direction. I want to thank you for supporting this collaboration; today, we will be signing a corresponding document.
Mr Prime Minister, I am very happy to see you in Russia.

Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihiko Noda
(retranslated): I am also very happy to meet with you following our meeting in Los Cabos. I am certain that under your leadership the APEC summit in Vladivostok will go smoothly.
And Japan welcomes Russia’s increased interest in the Asia-Pacific region.
Congratulations to you and all of Russia on winning three gold medals in judo at the London Olympics. I saw how happy that victory made you.
Vladimir Putin: It’s true, I can tell you that together, we are helping to spread this aspect of Japanese culture throughout nearly the entire world. Today, judo is one of the most popular sports in the world.
Although the Japanese athletes may not have performed to their fullest potential, the Japanese are nevertheless trendsetters and everyone tries to emulate Japanese athletes and the Japanese traditions in this sport.
Yoshihiko Noda: One woman on the Japanese team won gold, but the men only won silver and bronze.
Vladimir Putin: I suppose they gave others the opportunity to shine. If they were to win all the time, other participants might be less motivated.
Yoshihiko Noda: Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
I am very happy for this opportunity to speak with you on the sidelines of the APEC summit.
New Zealand is our long-term partner in the Asia-Pacific region and I would like to thank you for your help and support in preparing for the APEC summit this year.
Mr Prime Minister, I hope you will soon be visiting Moscow. You know about our invitation, I would like to renew it once again.
Our specialists are working on strengthening the contractual legal framework of our cooperation. I hope that we will make progress in several areas that are of mutual interest to us.
Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key
: Mr President, I want to congratulate Russia on your accession to the WTO and the tremendous gains for the people of Russia.
I want to congratulate you on this marvellous facility and the foresight of the Russian government for building such an amazing facility for the young people and their education, and to have APEC leaders coming here to see this facility to operate for APEC and then for its future use to be of such great importance to your country.
We are enjoying the conversations over here at APEC and we thank you for making time for this bilateral meeting. I know we are running very late and we appreciate you taking this opportunity given the pressures on your time.
So we look forward to coming to Moscow, and hopefully we can do that in 2013. We are interested in discussing the progress we are making with our free trade agreement and the steps we need to make to complete that deal.

APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting
Vladimir Putin opened the first working session of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Vladivostok.
September 8, 2012
09:00
Vladivostok
At the meeting participants discussed issues of trade and investment liberalisation, regional integration, as well as improving transport and logistics systems and infrastructure.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
At the beginning of our meeting I would like to welcome all of you in Russia, in Vladivostok.
On the onset of a meeting I would like to say that one of our colleagues, Australian Prime Minister had very unfortunate tragedy in her family – her father passed away. So I would like on behalf of all of us to express our condolences to her and members of her family, and welcome Australian Minister of Trade who will be heading Australian delegation at the meeting.
Once again I want to welcome all of you in Vladivostok, the city that for over 150 years has been a stronghold of Russia here in the Far East. Vladivostok is a modern, fast-growing city, true megapolis, which has huge business and financial potential, a place where East meets West, gateway of Russia to the vast areas of Pacific and Southeast Asia, a gateway that is open for all of you, our partners in Asia-Pacific region, and that provides rapid and most efficient route to Europe from this region.
”The 20th anniversary APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is taking place on the new premises of the Far East Federal University. We built the complex, the university campus that immediately after our Leaders’ Meeting adjourns will be handed over to the university, young people, students and academia. I hope that this university will become an educational and intellectual center not only attractive for the Far East of Russia, but for young people, scholars and researchers of the world.“
Colleagues, the 20th anniversary APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is taking place on the new premises of the Far East Federal University. And it gives me great pleasure that some of the colleagues mentioned specifically that they liked the venue. I have to mention that when we were thinking where to organize this big event, we decided to host it here, in Vladivostok to use it as an opportunity to develop Vladivostok.
We built the complex, the university campus that immediately after our Leaders’ Meeting adjourns will be handed over to the university, young people, students and academia. I hope that this university will become an educational and intellectual center not only attractive for the Far East of Russia, but for young people, scholars and researchers of the world.
I would like to use the occasion to invite your students and researchers to come here to study, to teach and I would like to make a suggestion to all of you present here. We will send an official invitation to all of you to speak in front of the students, of this university and talk to them about your vision of the future of the region, of the world in general, to address students as professors, as keynote speakers. I am sure you will find that interesting, and young people that are to study here will definitely greatly appreciate the opportunity.
Today’s plenary meeting has two items on its agenda. First is trade and investment liberalization and regional economic integration. Second is improving transport and logistics systems and infrastructure of the region. Tomorrow we are going to talk about food security and promoting innovative growth.
Let me start by saying a few words on the first point of our agenda – trade and investment liberalisation and regional economic integration.

This topic is of great relevance for us especially in the difficult economic situation today when the recovery of global economy is faltering. We can only overcome negative trends by expanding trade, services, enhancing flow of capital. It is important to follow fundamental principles of open markets and free trade.
Russia, as you know, has become a full-fledged member of the World Trade Organisation, so I would like to thank all of you colleagues for your unwavering support to Russia’s efforts of joining this international economic organisation.
Jointly with you, we are determined to make our contribution to designing more liberal rules and mechanisms of trade at the global and regional levels including in the APEC space. The priority goal is to jointly fight all forms of protectionism – both traditional and new.
Russia suggested to introduce monitoring of environmental policy measures, come up with coordinated principles of regulation in this field. Implementing our arrangements to reduce tariff rates for environmentally-friendly goods was not easy. In line with the APEC summit’s decision made in Honolulu in 2011, they should be reduced to 5% or less by 2015. We have achieved substantial progress in drafting the list of such goods.
What is important is that APEC members are determined to continue moving towards the formulated goal in the spirit of the APEC fundamental consensus principle. I believe we should thank our experts that worked very hard preparing today’s meeting and as result of this work worked out balanced compromises. I guess, we can say that our meeting will bring results due to these arrangements.
Strengthening transparency of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements will facilitate liberalisation. At our initiative, a model chapter on transparency was drafted to be included in this kind of agreements and it makes it mandatory to disclose substantial information on all preferential arrangements.
”By getting together and lifting barriers we encourage dynamic development of entire Asia-Pacific region and global economy in general.“
It is important to give special attention to investment liberalisation, improve business environment in the region. In our view, improvement of national dispute resolution mechanisms, especially at pre-trial stage, would serve that purpose. We should promote such mechanisms throughout entire APEC.
Let me say a few words about regional integration. I am sure it holds the future especially now when for many years we have seen WTO’s Doha Round of trade negotiations slippage. By getting together and lifting barriers we encourage dynamic development of entire Asia-Pacific region and global economy in general.
It is important to build bridges, not walls. We should continue striving toward greater integration, broaden dialogue between regional and sub-regional associations. It is in that direction that Russia will be moving and is already moving. This is precisely what we do in the former Soviet Union space.
You have certainly heard about our integration efforts. I am referring to the free trade zone within the CIS, the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. I suggest we exchange views on how we could encourage liberalisation of trade and investment in a more efficient way and take full advantage of regional integration.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Prime Minister, colleagues,
We are very happy to see you here in Russia.
Thailand is our longstanding, highly reliable partner in this region of the world. This year marks 115 years since the Russian monarch Nicholas II and Rama V made the decision to establish diplomatic ties. We greatly value the relations we have with Thailand’s royal family. I would like to ask you to give our very best wishes to the King and Queen of Thailand and all members of the royal family.
Our economic ties are developing quite actively. We are set on increasing mutual investments, including Thai investments in the Russian economy and agriculture. It is widely known that Thailand is a favourite tourist destination for Russian citizens: last year, 800,000 of our tourists visited your nation.
I am very happy to meet you and have the opportunity to meet with you in Russia, in Vladivostok.
Prime Minister of Thailand Yingluck Shinawatra
: First of all, we would like to thank you, Your Excellency and the government, for giving us this warm welcome, since this is my first trip to APEC.

And thank you for the long-term relationship that we have of over 100 years – it’s our 115th anniversary, so I think this is a very marked relationship between two countries. So we hope that we can explore the opportunities between two countries.
And also, we would like to invite you on a visit to Thailand as well.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I am very pleased that you were able to come to Vladivostok, but I would like to say that we would be happy to see you on a separate visit to Russia at any time convenient for you to discuss our bilateral relations in a broader format.

With President of South Korea Lee Myung-bak.
The state leaders discussed the possibility of developing trade and economic cooperation between their countries, as well as various aspects of their political relations.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, friends,
We are very happy to see you in Russia.
The Republic of Korea is our third largest trade and economic partner in Asia in terms of trade turnover, following China and Japan. Our turnover volume is $25 billion and last year it showed record growth of 40 percent.
We also have some problems; in my view, the main among them is low investment volume. At the same time, I want to note the fairly significant diversity of our relations, and mutual interest in working in sensitive areas such as shipbuilding, energy, fishing, transport, etc.
We have recently reached a high level of political cooperation and I think that there are very good prospects for developing our interstate relations.
President of South Korea Lee Myung-Bak
(retranslated): I am happy to see you, Mr President. I was here in Vladivostok 20 years ago, and I am amazed by the recent changes here, particularly in preparation for the APEC summit. I will take this opportunity to congratulate you on Russia’s accession to the WTO.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Lee Myung-Bak: And I also want to thank you for Russia’s active participation in the Yeosu expo.
In spite of the unfavourable global economic situation, Russia and Korea have achieved growth in their trade and economic relations. I am satisfied and hope that our trade relations will continue to develop.
Now, investment in Russia and Korea is becoming more active, and humanitarian exchanges are expanding. If we sign an agreement on eliminating the visa regime, it will promote mutually beneficial exchanges and contacts between the peoples of our two nations.
Once the number of businesspeople working in Russia and Korea increases, we will see an increase in the number of permanent residents from one another’s countries. So if we sign an agreement on social services, this will help our people as well.
While developing trade and economic relations, I hope we will also have active cooperation in assuring peace and security in this region. Moreover, I would like to note the strengthening of cultural ties between our nations.

With Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.
At the meeting, bilateral cooperation in various fields was discussed, particularly in trade, aviation and outer space.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
I am very happy to see you in Vladivostok.
We are developing very kind, good, constructive relations with your nation. Earlier, it was due to the support of your nation specifically that Russia became an observer in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Since then, we have been developing constructive relations in all areas, including our economic relations.
Unfortunately, last year, we observed some decrease in volume, but overall, we have still seen positive trends. I am referring to such areas as cooperation in air and space: with our support, the first Malaysian astronaut went into space. I am also referring to prospects for cooperation in aviation and other areas.
We are very happy to see you. Welcome, Mr Prime Minister.
Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak: Thank you very much, Mr President, for your very warm hospitality and your very positive words of encouragement.
First of all, I would like to congratulate Your Excellency for your appointment as President of the Russian Federation. Once again, congratulations for hosting APEC, and congratulations for your accession to the World Trade Organisation. So many congratulations in order.
I share with Your Excellency that our bilateral relations are based on very strong footing. They are very constructive relations spanning many years. You rightly said that with your assistance, we put our first man into space, and we have entered into some very important defence procurement with your country. I oversaw those practices when I was defence minister, especially the last one, with the purchase of the Sukhoi Su-30MKM – that equipment is serving us well. But the time has come for us to broaden the relationship and to look into new areas of cooperative relationship with you.
