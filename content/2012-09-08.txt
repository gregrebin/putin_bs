President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends,
We are very happy to see you here in Vladivostok. We have good experience in cooperating on both a personal level and an interstate level.
Naturally, I would like to begin by talking about the economy: since 2000, we have increased our trade turnover eight-fold, but unfortunately, the absolute values remain very low. Meanwhile, we have very significant opportunities. In my view, we are not taking sufficient advantage of them, although there are certain interesting areas, there are leaders in cooperation on both the Russian and Canadian side. I think that our challenge is to support them and find new promising areas for cooperation.
In addition, there is a great deal of interest in joint work in the Arctic. I hope that we will be able to work very effectively in the near future within the framework of the structures that have been created, with the prospects that our experts and specialists are proposing.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper: Thank you, Mr President, for your welcome and for holding this summit in this beautiful region of your nation.
This year, we are marking not only the 70th year of our bilateral relations between our countries, but also the 40th anniversary of the great Summit Series that, in many ways, is the beginning of the modern era of our cultural relations, so it’s a great time for me to be here.

Also, Mr President, I want to congratulate you and your country on your accession to the World Trade Organisation. I know that this is one of a series of important events for Russia – the holding of this summit, the holding of the Olympics, and also, of course, your accession to the World Trade Organisation, which I think, more than ever, will provide great economic opportunities to be explored between our two countries.
You are correct in observing that although our economic relations continue to expand, we have not in any way seen the potential of those come to pass yet, so you and I will talk about what we can do to further those relations, as well as a range of other issues. We will obviously be talking about international peace and security issues and some of the common challenges and experiences that we share as Arctic nations.
So once again, thank you for hosting me and I look forward to our discussions here.
Vladimir Putin: I had the pleasure of meeting with several of your outstanding hockey players. I must say that they are certainly ambassadors to the world in the broadest and most direct sense of this word.
I would like to ask you to pass on my words of gratitude to them for coming to Russia and playing a match against our hockey veterans yesterday in the city of Yaroslavl, where a terrible tragedy took place one year ago and an entire hockey team was killed.
As for sports, you know that we are preparing for the Olympic Games in 2014 and Canadian companies are also participating very actively in the work to prepare for this event.

With President of the Republic of Peru Ollanta Humala.
The heads of state discussed the prospects of further developing their countries’ economic, scientific, technical, cultural and humanitarian relations.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are happy to welcome you to Russia, here in the Far East, in Vladivostok.
I know that you have visited other Russian cities – I believe you went to Kazan and Irkutsk. I hope that this will not be your last visit to Russia, especially since we have much work to do together.
Unfortunately, our trade turnover is lower than we might like, but nevertheless, last year, we observed measurable growth. There are interesting potential areas for collaboration, including energy, fishing, military technical cooperation and education.
About 89 Peruvian students study at our universities, and we have agreed on the training for over two hundred service members at the Russian Defence Ministry’s military schools and academies.
Relations between our nations have deep roots and are currently based on the agreement of 2006.
Mr President, we are very happy to see you.
President of The Republic of Peru Ollanta Humala (retranslated): Mr President,
For my part, I would like to congratulate you on your inauguration.
It is a great honour and a pleasure for us to be present here at this summit, to strengthen and deepen our mutual relations. And we have the opportunity to take the relations between our two nations to a qualitatively new level.With President of the Republic of Chile Sebastian Pinera.
The two leaders discussed expanding trade and economic cooperation between their countries.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are very happy to see you and have the opportunity to meet on the sidelines of the APEC summit to talk about our bilateral relations.
Some time ago, we signed a partnership agreement and we are building our relations, our cooperation, within the framework of that document. I must say that we have positive momentum in our trade and economic ties, although the absolute values, unfortunately, are still nothing to brag about.
I very much hope that today’s meeting and subsequent contacts, particularly at the ministerial and expert level, will allow us to find additional directions for collaboration and take our cooperation to a higher level. I am certain that the fulfilment of the agreements we are reaching within the framework of such broad, general forums as APEC will promote this.
President of The Republic of Chile Sebastian Pinera (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. First of all, I would like to thank you for the excellent organisation of the APEC summit and the fact that it is happening in such a wonderful place, within the walls of Far East [Federal] University.
I wanted to say three things. First, I wanted to invite you to participate in the EU-LAC Summit, which will be held in Santiago de Chile at the end of January, when it will be summertime in our nation, and take this opportunity to visit Chile and Russia’s Antarctic bases.

Vladimir Putin: That’s a great suggestion.
Sebastian Pinera: A second idea I think you will find interesting is the need to intensify our trade relations, given the momentum in their development. We need to think about the possibility of developing agreements on free trade not only with Russia but also with its partners, Belarus and Kazakhstan. And based on that agreement, to increase not just turnover, not just the exchange of goods and services, but also the volume of mutual investment between Russia and Chile.
And finally, the third thing I wanted to say is that this year, we participated in the G20 summit that was held in Los Cabos on Mexico’s invitation; next year, as you know, the summit will be held in Russia, so it would also be a great privilege and honour for us to participate in that summit.
Vladimir Putin: That is what we will do, Mr President.Events

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
We are very happy to see you in Russia, this time in Vladivostok.
I am very pleased that we have established regular business contacts at practically every level, including at the political level. We met a short time ago in Los Cabos and now we have the opportunity to meet here in Russia. Just recently, I had the pleasure of meeting with your Foreign Minister on Sochi.
We have noted the growth in our turnover – last year, it was $30 billion. Today, we will take another step on the path to strengthening our trade and economic relations – I am referring to signing the agreement on energy and building a chemical enterprise on Russia’s territory with Japanese participation.
We are developing cooperation in the automotive industry; we are pleased to note the introduction of Japanese automakers on the Russian market, including here in the Far East.
Another issue is the fight against poaching. We agreed in Los Cabos that we would take serious steps in this direction. I want to thank you for supporting this collaboration; today, we will be signing a corresponding document.
Mr Prime Minister, I am very happy to see you in Russia.

Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihiko Noda
(retranslated): I am also very happy to meet with you following our meeting in Los Cabos. I am certain that under your leadership the APEC summit in Vladivostok will go smoothly.
And Japan welcomes Russia’s increased interest in the Asia-Pacific region.
Congratulations to you and all of Russia on winning three gold medals in judo at the London Olympics. I saw how happy that victory made you.
Vladimir Putin: It’s true, I can tell you that together, we are helping to spread this aspect of Japanese culture throughout nearly the entire world. Today, judo is one of the most popular sports in the world.
Although the Japanese athletes may not have performed to their fullest potential, the Japanese are nevertheless trendsetters and everyone tries to emulate Japanese athletes and the Japanese traditions in this sport.
Yoshihiko Noda: One woman on the Japanese team won gold, but the men only won silver and bronze.
Vladimir Putin: I suppose they gave others the opportunity to shine. If they were to win all the time, other participants might be less motivated.
Yoshihiko Noda: Thank you.

New Zealand is our long-term partner in the Asia-Pacific region and I would like to thank you for your help and support in preparing for the APEC summit this year.
Mr Prime Minister, I hope you will soon be visiting Moscow. You know about our invitation, I would like to renew it once again.
Our specialists are working on strengthening the contractual legal framework of our cooperation. I hope that we will make progress in several areas that are of mutual interest to us.
Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key
: Mr President, I want to congratulate Russia on your accession to the WTO and the tremendous gains for the people of Russia.
I want to congratulate you on this marvellous facility and the foresight of the Russian government for building such an amazing facility for the young people and their education, and to have APEC leaders coming here to see this facility to operate for APEC and then for its future use to be of such great importance to your country.
We are enjoying the conversations over here at APEC and we thank you for making time for this bilateral meeting. I know we are running very late and we appreciate you taking this opportunity given the pressures on your time.
So we look forward to coming to Moscow, and hopefully we can do that in 2013. We are interested in discussing the progress we are making with our free trade agreement and the steps we need to make to complete that deal.
