Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
You know that a terrorist attack occurred today in the village of Znamenskoye in the Nadterechny District in Chechnya. People were injured and killed. I ask the FSB Director to brief us about the event and what is being done to investigate the crime. I want you to report the plan of conducting this case jointly with the Prosecutor General’s Office.
There is no doubt in our minds that such terrorist attacks and all actions of this kind pursue one aim: to stop the process of political settlement in Chechnya. We cannot and will not allow any of this. I ask the President’s Executive Office and the Government together with the Administration of the Chechen Republic to carry on with the plan of normalising the situation in Chechnya, in particular, speeding up the drafting of the treaty on the delimitation of powers between the Federal Government and the Chechen Republic on the basis of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the Constitution of the Chechen Republic which was recently adopted in a nationwide referendum.
