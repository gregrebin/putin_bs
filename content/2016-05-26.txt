Meeting with Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, let me wish you a warm welcome to Moscow.
I want to start of course by congratulating you on your party’s convincing victory in the parliamentary election. What’s more, your allies also obtained the needed number of seats.
I know that the new government will be formed very soon. I hope that whatever new government’s composition, it will give a worthy place to people who give serious attention to developing the relations between the Russian Federation and Serbia. I hope that we will continue our work to strengthen our bilateral ties and continue our efforts to build up our political cooperation, our economic ties, and our work together on the international stage.
We are pleased with your victory and congratulate you on this event.
Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic
(retranslated): Mr President, first of all, thank you very much for your hospitality and for these very warm words.
We will do everything we can because our relations with the Russian Federation have great importance for us. We particularly value your personal contribution to developing the relations between our countries and strengthening our ties in all areas.
We will have the new government formed by mid-June. We consider it our honour and duty to do everything we can to continue developing our relations with the Russian Federation in all areas, in the economy and in the political sphere. Of course, our economic cooperation is the priority.
Once again, thank you very much for your warm words and congratulations.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
