Meeting with 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War veterans

Prokhorovka
Meeting with 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War veterans who took part in the battle of Kursk.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
Once again, let me greet you all here at this site that is sacred for our entire people and country. Here, they have long called this site Russia’s third great battlefield, and the whole country is coming to know this name. Indeed, after Kulikovo field, and after Borodino field, this battlefield at Prokhorovka is a symbol of the Russian people’s great spirit.
I want to thank Abram Yekhilevsky and all of you for the invitation. I had plans of course to come to the sites of the battle of Kursk over these days, but to be here with you, especially today and at your invitation, is a particular honour and pleasure.
You know better than anyone what makes today so special. It was on July 12 exactly 70 years ago that what was probably the key event in the battle of Kursk took place, when both we and our enemies launched direct tank offensives against each other.
By this time, the Soviet military command had reached a higher level and the soldiers were a lot better trained than compared to the start of the Great Patriotic War. All armed forces branches and troops were mobilised. This included not only tanks but also aviation, communications, and intelligence, which gave timely warning of the Nazi plans. Other troops and forces were mobilised too. All of this together brought about the result that we know.

Of course, our commanders’ talent also played its part — exceptional people took part in organising this battle, and so did the troops themselves directly on the battlefield.
We would be wrong to forget the people who lived in these areas and worked to prepare the battlegrounds so as to give you and your fellow soldiers the chance to clinch this unique success. The local people made a tremendous contribution to preparing a successful battle for us. They dug trenches, got roads and supply lines ready, set up communications systems. These tasks fell mostly to the local people, and as you yourselves know so well, they were primarily women, because all the men were away at the front.
In short, this was big event in our country’s history. I want to congratulate all of Russia’s people on this event, and of course I congratulate above all those who took direct part in all of the Great Patriotic War’s battles, and as we are here at the Prokhorovka battlefield, I especially congratulate those who took part in the battle of Kursk.
I congratulate you all and wish you all success!
We will be offered tea now and will have a chance to talk before the Russian Pobeda (Victory) Organising Committee’s meeting, at which we will discuss preparations for the 70th anniversary of victory in the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War. You know that we place a lot of importance on all of the round number anniversary dates. Today, we will discuss together how best to prepare for 2015, when we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War.
We will have the chance to talk about routine and current matters over a cup of tea. Thank you very much for your attention.

Working meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu during his trip to Belgorod Region.
July 12, 2013
17:00
Prokhorovka, Belgorod Region
With Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.
The President gave instructions to hold a surprise military inspection in the Eastern Military District and put the Eastern Military District troops on full alert in the early hours of July 13, and then deliver them to training grounds.
Given the scale of the upcoming exercises and taking into account current international practices, President Putin instructed the Defence Minister to brief the Russian Federation’s foreign partners on the upcoming military exercise.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu,
You and I have held several surprise inspections and subsequent exercises in the Southern, Western, and Central Military Districts. Experience shows that these events are highly useful and effective in identifying problems and correcting them.
I instruct you to hold the same type of surprise inspection in the Eastern Military District, to convey these instructions to all personnel, and to put the troops of the Eastern Military District on full alert at 01:00 on July 13, subsequently transferring them to their training areas, to the practice grounds.
It is important to give particular attention to fulfilling the objectives before us, moving large numbers of military personnel to assembly areas, providing transportation, logistical and medical support.
I am asking you to take all the necessary measures to assure safety, to make the necessary arrangements to prevent damage to state property, private property and farmland.
Please also take measures related to sea and vessels rescues, including the underwater fleet rescues. I ask that you brief me regularly over the course of this process.
I will now look at my schedule, and it is possible that I will participate in some of the events testing how these instructions are carried out.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu
: Will be done, Mr President.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon colleagues and veterans,
The Organising Committee has developed a fine tradition of holding its meetings on preparing for victory anniversary celebrations at the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War’s main battle sites. Today’s meeting is no exception, as we are here in the Belgorod Region, which saw very fierce fighting during those days. We are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the legendary battle of Kursk at this time, and I of course want to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate everyone, especially the war veterans, on this symbolic date.
Events such as the battles of Kursk, Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and the Caucasus do not simply mark stages in the Great Patriotic War, but are the fabric from which our country’s heroic history and the common memory of our forebears’ valour and courage are woven. Their dedicated love for the homeland is an example to all of the post-war generations. It is our duty to follow this example and preserve and hand down to our descendants the truth about the war, the facts, and the heroes, including by marking anniversary dates and important events in our history on the scale they deserve.
May 9 is of course one of the most sacred and important dates. We have less than two years to go before the 70th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War. Preparing for the celebrations is a big task and we must do everything to make sure the anniversary is celebrated at the highest level and with depth and substance. Of course the veterans are the main participants in these celebrations. We must step up our work to improve the social and economic conditions for Great Patriotic War veterans, invalids, participants, and those with equivalent status.
We will examine the proposals in this area at today’s meeting. Let me stress that we must always keep actual individuals at the centre of our attention.
The regional and municipal authorities must clearly identify each individual veteran’s needs and resolve their problems without conditions. This is to be done right away, not waiting for 2015 to come around. It is important to be creative in preparing the celebrations, and even more important to be sincere. If you are sincere, the veterans, the people who should be at the centre of our attention, will feel this warmth. Our young people should feel it too.
We have to specially design programmes for young people and get professionals involved who know how to prepare these sorts of events with a modern and substance-filled approach. No one needs formal events held just for the record, and this kind of thing should not exist at all. We must organise this anniversary decently and pay close attention to the artistic and humanitarian sides of the celebrations.
We have already developed some good formats for work with young people. They include theme-based school events, meetings with war veterans, and laying flowers at war memorials. But I am sure that new approaches are required in patriotic education too, today, approaches designed for today’s people, today’s youth.
In particular, I propose that we turn to the search for heroes of the Great Patriotic War not yet known to the general public. The military archives hold thousands of documents with unique information about remarkable facts and heroic deeds, and we must persistently release these facts from the archives, year after year, make them public, make films about them, organise memorable events based around them.
I hope very much for help here from the media, the film industry, historians, local historians, museum curators, and archivists and librarians.
Victory Day is a very honest and sincere holiday and we should treat it accordingly. We are to also undertake large-scale work to get military burial sites into decent order.
I met just before with Great Patriotic War veterans and nearly all of them touched on this issue in one form or another. I am talking above all about small village memorials and common graves and monuments. We should get children and teenagers involved in this noble work too, and organise youth volunteer brigades. But let me stress that civil society initiatives alone will not be enough to resolve this whole task. The state and local authorities also have a duty to organise and finance this work.
I ask you too, not to forget about the Soviet military burial sites abroad. They also need to be looked after in general and kept in order. During these preparations for the 70th anniversary of the victory, I ask you to pay particular attention to the international component and organise, including with the help of our institutions abroad, thematic events in which our compatriots abroad and war veterans from the CIS and Baltic countries, from the allied armies, and the descendants of those who fought Nazism in Germany itself will be able to take part.
The victory against Nazism belongs to the entire Soviet people. It was achieved not just through force of arms but also through the strength of the brotherhood in combat and labour between people of all different nationalities. The anniversary celebrations and their preparations should help to develop this friendship and strengthen understanding and trust between peoples who lived together for decades in a single country, defended it, rebuilt it from the ruins, and supported each other as only the closest of kin can do. We must do everything we can to pass the memory of this brotherhood on from one generation to the next.
Let me add that we plan to issue a common Commonwealth of Independent States anniversary decoration to mark this date. It will be an honorary order – 70th anniversary of Victory in the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War — which will be presented to those who fought on the frontlines. A medal of the same name will be presented to Russian veterans and foreign citizens who fought in USSR armed forces national troop formations, or in partisan detachments and underground groups. We hope that these decorations will be approved at the Council of CIS Heads of State meeting.
Based on our experience organising the celebrations of the 60th and 65th anniversaries of the victory, we would like you to establish an organising committee to organise the main events for the 70th anniversary celebrations.
As for the committee’s membership, I think this is a matter for the members of the Victory Organising Committee to decide together with the relevant federal and regional authorities.
Thank you for your attention.
