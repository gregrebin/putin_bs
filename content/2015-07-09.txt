President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Ufa.
We’re happy to see business leaders from the BRICS
countries here. You know that we not only ask for your opinions on how to organise cooperation within BRICS and what principles to incorporate into its institutional documents, but we also try to implement them.
Today the BRICS leaders will meet with members of their business communities. I am honoured to give the floor to my BRICS colleagues. We’ll also listen to what you have to say, and then I’ll sum up the results of our discussion.
<…>
Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to begin by thanking the national leaders: the President of Brazil, the Prime Minister of India, the Chairman of the People's Republic of China and the President of the South Africa for their substantive and interesting statements. I would also like to thank the [Business] Council Chairman Mr Katyrin and all of you for the work done in preparation for the summit.
Just before the meeting with the business community I had a brief discussion with trade union leaders from your nations. They also made proposals for the BRICS leaders in the hope that these proposals would be taken into account as we draft our documents and plan our practical actions.
This will be done, we will definitely take into account the trade unions' proposals. I cannot but agree with them that it is only through cooperation between businesses, workforce representatives, which are the trade unions, and the state that we can reach the best compromises to ensure sustainable development and improve wellbeing of our countries' citizens.
Unfortunately, our schedule does not allow us to have an extensive discussion at this point, which would undoubtedly be interesting for you and all my colleagues, I am sure. However, I would like to assure you that we will definitely take into account all the proposals you put together as you prepared for this meeting. Already now we can say with full confidence, and you all know it too, that based on these very proposals – the proposals made by your Council, we resolved to make a broader use of national currencies in our trade and economic exchanges.
We have even created contingent arrangement with some countries. Thus, our banks swapped resources with the People's Republic of China and they already traded ruble-yuan futures. I believe it would be interesting to see the same developments with India, Brazil and South Africa, and this would help increase trade turnover. On your initiative, we launched a dialogue on the unification of e-trade rules, and our colleagues here have just spoken about simplifying visa rules for business representatives, and this was also your initiative.
I would like to use my right as chairman and say that Russia is also creating favourable conditions for the development of cooperation in all areas, both in investment and in trade. I would like to note here that, despite all the difficulties facing the global economy and the Russian economy, we are managing to maintain the foundations of the Russian economy we have reinforced in the past 10–15 years.
We keep the unemployment at a very low level of 5.8 percent, we have maintained our reserves, we have a positive trade balance, and the national currency exchange rate stays within an acceptable range. All this gives us the right to say that together with our colleagues, we will overcome the current difficulties too. I would also like to draw your attention to those extra opportunities available to the entire business community of the BRICS nations in connection with the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to thank you for taking part in our work. I hope representatives of the business community will continue to make their noticeable contribution to the coordination of efforts to develop the economies of our countries.
Here I have to end this meeting. Thank you very much for your work.

With Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Host Photo Agency BRICS and SCO summits
The two leaders discussed key issues of Russian-Iranian relations, particularly prospects for expanding trade and economic ties and energy cooperation.
The presidents of Russia and Iran also exchanged views on pressing international issues, primarily the settlement of Iran’s nuclear issue, assistance in resolving regional conflicts and countering terrorist threats.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, colleagues, please allow me to warmly welcome you to Russia.
I want to thank you for making the decision to come here and participate in the BRICS
events.
Iran is our traditional reliable partner in the region; our relations are developing positively. In spite of all the difficulties in the global economy and the well-known limitations, last year our turnover grew slightly, and this trend has been maintained in the first quarter of this year. Our foreign ministries are working actively to coordinate their positions and we are developing inter-parliamentary ties.
Overall, we can say that we are happy with how our relations are developing, but there are always issues that require special attention on our part, and I am very happy for the opportunity to discuss them today.
Welcome!
President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Hassan Rouhani
(retranslated): Mr President, I am very happy to be in this wonderful city of Ufa today. Naturally, these days are quite difficult and busy for me, but regardless, I could not fail to accept your invitation to visit Ufa.
In the last two years, we have made many steps toward one another. I am confident that with the political will from both sides, we will be able to move our bilateral cooperation forward in all areas. I am certain that at this meeting – as at our previous ones – we will be able to make real progress on issues that need further coordination.
And now, I would like to give you the traditional Iranian wish – “Do not get tired!” – since you have just held three very significant sessions in a row. And this also reflects Russia’s outstanding role not only in regional affairs, but also in international issues. The Islamic Republic of Iran is interested in developing and deepening cooperation with all three organisations.
We also feel it is our obligation to note and thank you for the efforts by the Russian side that it has consistently made to move talks on the Iranian nuclear programme forward, as well as Mr Lavrov
’s personal efforts.

Before a meeting with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. Vladimir Putin had a meeting with President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
The President of Russia presented the Order of Alexander Nevsky decoration to the President of Kazakhstan. The decoration was awarded in recognition of Mr Nazarbayev’s great contribution to Russian-Kazakhstani cooperation and active input into the promotion of bilateral coordination to advance Eurasian integration processes.
The Order of Alexander Nevsky is awarded for outstanding personal achievements in nation-building, many years of honest service and high results in carrying out official duties, merits in strengthening Russia’s international prestige and defence capacity, and the development of the economy, science, education, culture, arts and healthcare.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev,
Before we begin the business-oriented portion of our meeting, I would like to once again congratulate you on your birthday. I called you and explained why I was unable to see you in person because of my schedule.
But you know that I, along with the entire nation of Russia, regard you with deep respect and love. And as a symbol of your merits to our peoples, for the initiative you showed from the beginning in the integration processes that have now come to a logical conclusion, a decision was made to award you a Russian Federation state decoration: the Order of Alexander Nevsky. And it is my pleasure to present it to you. This is truly a “battle” award, and it is well-deserved. Thank you.
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Please allow me to thank you with all my heart, Mr Putin, for your attention and that you never forget, you are always true to your sense of friendship; I know very well that you are truly a man of your word. I will use this opportunity to thank all of Russia, the Russian people, and the media that have given me significant attention over the last several days.
We do what we do for all of us, for the Russian and Kazakhstani peoples. Today is an historic, great day that has brought together 14 presidents from different continents, different nations.
I had said that one day, all this will unite into a single integrated union: the Eurasian Union from West to East; BRICS
from North to South. And ultimately, this will be a great union.
We know that some people do not like this, but they do not like it because it has great promise. That merit is yours, Mr Putin. Thank you very much. I wish you health and success in all your affairs.

Meeting with President of China Xi Jinping and President of Mongolia Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. Host Photo Agency BRICS and SCO summits
The three leaders discussed, among other things, work to promote trilateral cooperation and prospects for its further development.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues, Chairman Xi Jinping
, President Elbegdorj
,
Last year, in Dushanbe, we essentially opened a new page in the relations between our nations and launched a mechanism for trilateral meetings at the highest level on the President of Mongolia’s initiative. As they say in the East, a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step, and it has been made in the right direction.
Of course, it is probably more difficult to come to a trilateral agreement when we must take into account the interests of each partner than to engage in bilateral dialogue, but Russia, China and Mongolia are close neighbours, united by rich historical traditions of friendship and good neighbourly relations between our peoples.
We understood the enormous potential of Russian-Chinese-Mongolian cooperation, so we instructed our relevant departments to begin coordinating concrete areas in our cooperation. And today, we can draw some conclusions.
In the last year, we have had three rounds of consultations at the Deputy Foreign Minister level; in May, the first meeting between transport ministers was held here in Ufa.
The Russian side presented an initiative to strengthen the comprehensive nature of our trilateral cooperation through a special document: a roadmap. A corresponding project is prepared for each meeting establishing priority areas of cooperation: politics, security, the economy, trans-border and interregional ties, science and technology, the humanitarian sector and international affairs. I would like to propose that we adopt this road map.
In addition, we signed several documents on the sidelines of our meeting: a memorandum on mutual understanding on the creation of an economic corridor (the initiative was presented by Chairman Xi Jinping back in Dushanbe), an agreement on cooperation in the development of checkpoints along the border and a memorandum on the creation of favourable conditions for developing trade.
Experts are working on other promising projects, such as constructing transit power lines from Russia to China across Mongolia’s territory and the creation of a trilateral transport and logistics company. Relevant companies are exploring the formation of a transport corridor based on the Ulan-Bator railway.
Talks are underway to deepen cooperation in tourism. On March 27, the second coordination council on cooperation in tourism was held in Irkutsk with support by our Rostourism department. The meeting addressed specific joint projects: organising a “Great Tea Road” tourist route, a special Star of Eurasia tourist train (Beijing–Chita–Ulan-Ude–Irkutsk), the formation of a cross-border tourist cluster and holding an international tourism exhibition.
I’ll take this opportunity to once again thank Chairman of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping and President Elbegdorj for participating in the May celebrations in Moscow honouring the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
In Ulan-Bator last September, Mr President of Mongolia and I participated in celebratory events honouring the 75th anniversary of victory at the Khalkhin-Gol river and paid tribute to the memory of Soviet and Mongolian soldiers. And on September 3 of this year, we will all be celebrating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Beijing. This is a memorable date for the entire global community and, of course, for the peoples of Russia, Mongolia and China.
Thank you for your attention.

Speech at BRICS leaders’ summit with heads of invited states
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
I am happy to welcome participants to the joint session of leaders from BRICS nations, Shanghai Cooperation Organisationmember states and the Eurasian Economic Union.
BRICS has developed a useful tradition started by our South African friends: inviting the heads of states that are geographically and geopolitically close to the chairing nation to the BRICS summit. Two years ago in Durban, we discussed what must be done to strengthen ties with African nations. A year ago, in Fortaleza, Brazil, we exchanged views on how to jointly develop cooperation with South American states. Today, we have the opportunity to talk about ways to deepen cooperation in Eurasia.
Like each of our nations, all our associations and organisations have a common interest in developing optimal methods for sustainable development, and an aspiration to ensure the well-being and prosperity of our peoples under guaranteed peace and security.
We are all working under the principles of mutual respect, equality and open dialogue. At the same time, our different historical, cultural and regional traditions, as well as our socioeconomic structures, do not divide us; on the contrary, they allow us to build a fair and comprehensive partnership model that is capable of ensuring sustainable global governance in the 21st century.
I am convinced that this is the only foundation we should use to seek and find solutions to acute international problems, to respond to challenges and threats that are relevant to all of humanity such as the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, extremism, transnational crime, drug trafficking, and food and water shortages.
The topic we have chosen for our outreach format is Ways to Increase the Well-Being of Our Nations. Within such a well-represented session, it would be quite useful to discuss development prospects in Eurasia and touch on strengthening ties with other regions of the world.
I truly believe we have all the prerequisites to expand the horizons of mutually beneficial cooperation, combining our existing raw materials, human capital and enormous consumer market capacity to achieve a major economic breakthrough.
We have unique opportunities to implement our continent’s transit potential. I am referring to the construction of new, effective transport and logistics chains, particularly implementing the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative, as well as developing transport links in the Eastern part of the Russian Federation and Siberia.
This can connect the dynamically growing markets in Asia and the mature European economies, which have a wealth of industrial and technological achievements, while simultaneously allowing our nations to become more competitive in the race for investors, creating new jobs and cutting-edge manufacturing.
Our planet’s population growth requires activating cooperation on food security, intensifying agriculture, prudently using water resources and, of course, caring for the earth’s entire biosphere to save the planet for future generations.
And another issue we view as fundamental: a just and secure world is impossible to build without close humanitarian cooperation. That is precisely why Russia strives to deepen contacts in culture, science, education, tourism with all its partners through BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Eurasian Union and through other formats.
Civilian, parliamentary and youth forums are being organised on our initiative; we are also implementing joint cultural programmes, creating inter-university associations, such as the SCO and BRICS network universities.
I would like to invite all our friends and colleagues, the heads of state and government, to share their views on the topics of today’s meeting, as well as other matters that are relevant for us.
Thank you for your attention.

The Russian President noted that the BRICS

Speech at a meeting with representatives of the BRICS trade union organisations
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Hello, friends,
It is a pleasure to welcome here in Ufa the leaders of the BRICS trade union organisations. I would like to begin by saying that cooperation in the social sphere, in matters of labour and employment are undoubtedly a priority for us, just as it is for any government.
Otherwise, there’s the big question of what we are working for. In the final count, this is our target. In the course of Russia's presidency, we did our best to get the trade unions, business and academic community and youth organisations engaged in this work to the maximum, and we provided every assistance in arranging a trade union forum on the sidelines of the Ufa Summit.
The chairman of our trade unions informed me that you are preparing corresponding recommendations for the BRICS leaders, and we will consider them carefully.
On Russia's initiative, the first conference of the BRICS labour ministers will take place in January of next year. It will focus on creating new quality jobs, enhancing labour mobility and adjusting social integration processes. These are all very important tasks, in which we are already making headway.
The member states of this organisation are world leaders in unemployment reduction, which is one of the top criteria in assessing economic efficiency. We are working to bring down the so-called unreported employment and are creating new jobs.
At the same time we are fully aware of the numerous tasks still facing us. We need to join the efforts of our states, trade unions and employers to improve the system of labour market regulation, protection of workers' interests and ensuring their rights.
Modernisation of the economy, introduction of modern technology raises the workers' qualification requirements. We definitely need to raise the level of professional education and develop a new system of professional standards that would serve as a guideline for professional education programmes.
In this connection I would like to mention the Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives, which is successfully implementing an entire complex of projects to stimulate interest in professional education among young people. I believe this experience may be useful for other BRICS members.
The employment services’ work should also be taken to a new level. They are to provide up-to-date information on available vacancies and find jobs that match the candidate's skills and education, and not only near their home, but also in other regions that may have a workforce deficit.
The problem of reducing the unofficial “grey” employment is of primary importance for the BRICS nations. The Russian Government is drafting proposals on a set of measures to encourage employers to develop the official sector, pay official salaries and contribute to the budget by paying social taxes.
This is also in the interests of the employees, as the official salary goes to ensure their social rights, one of the most important one being pensions. Such measures might include the creation of more comfortable conditions for doing business, providing access to preferential sources of funding and encouraging investment.
The joint work by the BRICS nations to develop the labour market would be impossible without harmonising such key indicators as the growing number of able-bodied citizens, labour productivity in agriculture and industry, employment among young people and women, and the level of occupational injuries and diseases. For this purpose Russia has initiated the creation of a single BRICS information resource.
But first of all, I would like to hear what you have to say. Therefore, I conclude my opening remarks here and I am happy to give the floor to the Chairman of the Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions Mr Shmakov.

Press statement following BRICS summit
July 9, 2015
15:30
Ufa
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the media,
Allow me, acting on behalf of my colleagues – the BRICS
leaders, to make a brief statement following our work.
The agenda of the BRICS summit was very busy and substantive, which is a direct reflection of the diversity and depth of interaction between our five countries.
As you may know, this morning we had a meeting with the BRICS trade union leaders. We exchanged views regarding ways to improve social security and raise employment, noted the importance of combining the efforts of states, trade unions and employers to optimise labour market regulation and ensure the workers' rights and interests.
Then the BRICS heads of state and government had a meeting with the organisation's Business Council. The businessmen shared the results of the BRICS Business Summit (involving some 700 participants) that took place on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum
and presented proposals regarding deepening cooperation in trade, investment and technology.

BRICS summit documents
July 9, 2015
The focal point was the meeting of BRICS national leaders held in a narrow and expanded formats, which are traditionally held in a friendly and constructive atmosphere. We had a detailed discussion of the entire range of issues pertaining to cooperation within our organisation and adopted the Ufa Declaration and Action Plan that includes large-scale targets for the BRICS activities next year and in the long term.
The discussion in the narrow format focussed on pressing global and regional issues. The Ufa summit is taking place in the year of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the creation of the United Nations. These anniversaries remind the international community of the need to join efforts to maintain peace, stability and security, the importance of preserving the central role of the United Nations, the importance of complying with international law, respect for the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs.
The leaders of our nations have agreed to further coordinate their foreign policies within BRICS. Our countries will continue interacting with the UN, its regional and sectoral structures and forums. We intend to jointly resist the spreading threat of terrorism and extremism, prevent the resurrection of the Nazi ideology, jointly contribute to combatting drug trafficking and piracy and work on information security, including on the Internet.
We dealt in detail with the situation in the global economy. We are concerned about the market instability, the high volatility of prices for energy resources and raw materials, and accumulation by a number of major countries of a sovereign debt. In these conditions, the BRICS nations intend to more actively use their own resources and internal development reserves.
Russia's presidency put forward the initiative for closer coordination of the BRICS macroeconomic policy. Our partners supported our proposals on expanding mutual trade and capital investment, and this was reflected in the BRICS Economic Partnership Strategy through 2020 that we approved.
The five nations will clearly continue the practice of aligning their approaches within the G20. At the coming G20 summit in Turkey, we intend to hold a traditional separate meeting of the BRICS leaders. We will fully support China's presidency of the G20 in 2016, actively promote the reform of the global financial and economic architecture, and work to expand the role of rapidly developing economies in the International Monetary Fund.
Meanwhile, BRICS is creating its own financial structure. At our expanded meeting, we witnessed the completion of the process to create the New Development Bank and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement with a total volume of $200 billion. They will soon become fully operable. Thus, the New Development Bank will start funding joint large-scale projects in transport and energy infrastructure and in industrial development. We plan to develop a long-term list of specific projects, the so-called roadmap of investment cooperation by the end of the year.
The BRICS leaders supported the efforts of the Russian presidency to expand humanitarian cooperation. The Agreement on Cooperation in Culture is to promote more active contacts between our countries.
To increase exchanges in education and science on the basis of our countries' top universities, we are creating the BRICS Network University. We hope that the Civic BRICS, the BRICS Parliamentary and Youth forums that were first held this year will become regular.
The BRICS summit agenda does not end here. There will be an 'outreach' meeting with the heads of state and observers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
and the Eurasian Economic Union
. This joint session will carry on the useful practice launched by our South African friends.
Two years ago in South Africa, we discussed the ties between BRICS and African states, last year in Brazil – prospects for developing cooperation with Latin American states, while today we will consider cooperation on the vast expanses of Eurasia.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that our work in Ufa was aimed at stepping up our diverse cooperation within BRICS. Our organisation will continue making its contribution to international security and global growth, to the resolution of today’s major challenges.
Thank you for your attention.

Speech at BRICS leaders' meeting in expanded format
July 9, 2015
13:00
Ufa
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
We continue our meeting in expanded format with the participation of our delegations. In line with the agenda, we will have a detailed discussion of the pressing issues pertaining to BRICS
activities, primarily in the economic sphere.
The organisation’s member states play an important role in the global economy. At the end of last year, the BRICS aggregate GDP exceeded $32 trillion, which is a 60 percent growth since the foundation of BRICS accounting for almost 30 percent of the global GDP.
BRICS nations produce a third of the world’s industrial products and one half of agricultural goods. We have huge human resources: 43 percent of the world population – this is an enormous consumer market with a constantly growing demand for modern goods and services.
Close economic cooperation ties the BRICS nations closer together. Internal trade is growing – it has gone up by 70 percent since 2009, while Russia’s trade with its member states, for instance, has doubled.
Last year, the BRICS economies attracted 20.5 percent of the world’s total direct foreign investment, while in 2009 the number stood at only 16.9 percent. The share of our countries in capital investment on the global markets has gone up significantly – from 9.7 to 14 percent.
Significant work has been done to strengthen economic cooperation between the BRICS nations. I would like to note that we see this as support from all our partners in this organisation, and I would like to thank you, colleagues, for this.
Significant work has been done to implement the resolutions of last year’s summit in Fortaleza, Brazil. One of the top achievements was the launch of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the New Development Bank. Our countries have successfully completed the ratification of the relevant agreements.
We have approved the procedures for the Contingent Reserve Arrangement bodies and appointed heads of the New Development Bank: Mr Kamath representing India is the bank’s President, and vice-presidents from Russia, Brazil, China and South Africa will assist him in his work.
The Contingent Reserve Arrangement with a capital of $100 billion will make it possible to timely and adequately respond to financial market fluctuations. The New Development Bank, in its turn, with a capital of another $100 billion, will implement large-scale development projects in the organisation’s member states.
We expect to see the first ones launched next year. As we have seen earlier today during the meeting with representatives of the BRICS Business Council, companies from our countries are ready to create joint ventures and enhance mutual investment and trade.
Among the documents prepared for approval by the summit is the BRICS Economic Partnership Strategy through 2020. It sets the task of making our economies more competitive on the global markets, strengthening ties in energy, high technology, agriculture, science and education. Russia has also drafted a road map for BRICS investment cooperation. We expect our partners to contribute to it so that we could finalise the document before the end of the year.
We had consultations with our business representatives and have already placed some 50 projects and business initiatives on this roadmap. These include proposals to set up an Energy Association, create an International Centre for Energy Studies and a Foundry Union.
The joint use of navigation systems, including the Russian GLONASS
, opens up broad opportunities. Russian companies are interested in developing cooperation in such areas as production of medical and electronic equipment, software and other.
We also propose launching within the framework of this organisation, a mechanism for joint studies of competition and unification of anti-trust regulation, developing closer cooperation on the subjects of labour and employment, population and workforce migration – as I have already said today, I had a detailed discussion on this issue with the leaders of BRICS trade union organisations. They supported Russia’s initiative to hold meetings of relevant ministers.
Russia considers broader humanitarian cooperation within BRICS of major importance. The Agreement on Cooperation in Culture that our ministers are to sign today aims at further deepening the friendly ties between our peoples.
The year of Russia’s presidency saw the first meetings of the Civic BRICS, the BRICS Parliamentary and Youth forums. We are working on the issue of creating a BRICS Network University and are analysing the initiative to create a Council of the regions of the BRICS nations.
The launch of a ‘virtual secretariat’ will contribute to further reinforcement of the organisation’s institutional foundations. This modern internet portal will make it possible to further simplify interaction between our countries, while the public will get access to current information on the BRICS activities.
These and many other products developed during Russia’s presidency have found their reflection in the Ufa Declaration and Action Plan. These are complex documents that we are to approve at the end of our meeting; they set the key targets not only for the coming year, but for a longer term as well.
I would like to thank you for your attention and give the floor to Mr Narendra Mori, Prime Minister of India, the country that will take over the presidency of this organisation next year.
