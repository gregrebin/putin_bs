Meeting with Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan
November 26, 2021
As we said after our trilateral meeting, and I think you will agree with it, the meeting was instrumental and timely in view of the previous and current developments. We have gathered here to thwart any tragic events on the border and in general between the two countries and peoples, so as to move forward, as we said. All the region’s nations – Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, are interested in that.
Let us hope that the agreements we reached today will bring positive results as soon as possible.
Regarding our bilateral relations, we said repeatedly, and I want to stress it again, that relations between Russia and Armenia are of a strategic and allied nature rooted deep in history. We value that very much and we will continue maintaining this level of contacts in every possible way.
Economically, Russia is Armenia’s biggest trade and economic partner and the biggest investor in the Armenian economy. True, last year the turnover slumped somewhat. However, this year it is progressing rapidly, I would say, and I hope that we will reach the pre-pandemic level and move beyond it.
I am confident that now, after the trilateral format (you know and we agreed about the schedule that I meet with President of Azerbaijan prior to the trilateral meeting) during our bilateral meeting we have a chance to discuss the entire range of our bilateral ties.
Please.
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan
: Thank you, Mr President.
I want to thank you once again for the invitation and the organisation of today’s meetings.
Obviously, our bilateral relations are very important. You have already stressed that Russia and Armenia have strategic and allied relations. We have a very packed agenda practically in all areas. We are cooperating, and we have an agenda within CSTO, CIS, the Eurasian Economic Union.
However, I have to acknowledge that during our recent meetings we have discussed mostly the regional agenda because it has many interdependent issues.
I want to highlight again the role you played in stopping the 44-day war and deploying Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. Stabilising factors are crucial in our region. You have underscored a number of times today the importance of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. This issue is invariably discussed at our bilateral meetings as well.
Since we have already covered regional issues, I want to note that that despite economic and other difficulties, Russian investments in the Republic of Armenia seem to be on the rise this year. This is very important for us because I think it is a sign for investors that the Republic of Armenia is a very reliable country, and this matters a lot of us.
Of course, COVID-related economic problems, regretfully, persist but we recently noticed with satisfaction the stepping-up of the turnover within the Eurasian Economic Union. This is very important, too.
I hope we will be able to ultimately arrive at the solution on opening all economic and transport communications in our region, which will do a great deal to energise trade and economic relations within the EAEU and Armenian-Russian bilateral ties.
Thank you once again.
Vladimir Putin: I completely agree with you. These communications, transport routes we spoke about in the trilateral format today, are crucial for all the countries in the region, including Russia, because we are interested in these transport routes with our strategic partner Armenia being reliable, diversified and readily available all year round, which is key. I hope we will move onto the final stages of this work. There are some points I saw today that require additional coordination but they are not of fundamental nature, which also became obvious during our discussions today.
As for purely economic and pragmatic issues, I can say that everything has been basically agreed on, so I have no doubt that the progress will be noticeable and positive very soon. And you are absolutely right and I agree with you, we spoke about this during the trilateral discussion: as soon as people see how everything has begun working, the region will have a different atmosphere, there is no doubt about that. Therefore, I want to thank you for today’s constructive conversation.
Meanwhile, we also have an opportunity to speak about bilateral issues. We maintain regular contacts, we often meet and speak regularly over the phone. But today we have a chance to speak in person, so let us seize this opportunity.
Thank you very much.

Statements by leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia following trilateral talks
November 26, 2021
20:00
Sochi
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
To conclude our trilateral meeting, I would like to thank again my colleagues, the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia, for agreeing to come to Russia today and to discuss the situation taking shape in the region in general and as regards the settlement of the Karabakh problem.
I should say from the start that our talks today were very constructive. It was an in-depth analysis of the current situation. We gave credit to the efforts of the Russian peacekeepers, border guards and those specialists who conduct mine clearing and ensure people’s return to their homes.
I also want to stress that we agreed on a number of issues which I consider vital. The first of them is the establishment of mechanisms for border demarcation and delimitation between the two states, and we agreed to complete this work by the end of the year. I hope it will happen as soon as possible. There are no obstacles to establishing such mechanisms.
Second, I would like to mention a very important and sensitive point related to humanitarian issues, and we have also made good progress here.
Finally, we held an in-depth discussion on economic issues, on developing economic ties, and spoke about unblocking transport corridors as the first step. This concerns both railway and road traffic.
I think we ought to thank our deputy prime ministers who have been working on this issue for a long time, and we agreed that next week they will meet in Moscow to sum up some of the results and announce the decisions we approved today.
Thank you very much once again for today’s work. I want to thank both the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia.
President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
To begin with, let me once again express my gratitude for today’s meeting as well as for your efforts to create a favourable atmosphere in resolving issues between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
A year has passed since the trilateral Statement put an end to the war between the two countries, and we generally view this year as a positive one. I would like to use this opportunity to thank you again, Mr President, and the Russian Defence Ministry for the peacekeeping efforts in Karabakh. There have been no serious incidents in the zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeeping forces.
There have been many important events during this year. This is our second meeting in this format; the first one was held at the beginning of the year and this one is to finish the year. I do not want to repeat what the President of Russia said about delimitation, demarcation and unblocking of transport arteries. Today we have had a very detailed and I would say sincere talk on all these issues. We openly discussed our plans that cause concern of both parties, and I think the key is that the decisions we made regarding settling arguments and disputes will contribute to making the situation in the South Caucasus safer and more predictable.
Also, as the President of Russia noted, humanitarian issues were discussed. Azerbaijan always consistently advocated the observance of all humanitarian norms, be it during hostilities or afterwards. I must say that after the hostilities ended, over 100 Armenian servicemen were returned to Armenia, including one today who had been wounded and was treated by Azerbaijani doctors, as well as a civilian who got lost on our territory. It means we have always proceeded from the primacy of the principle of humanism and we are set to proceed in that direction. We see the same commitment from the Armenian side to build conditions for the situation in the region to be more predictable.
I repeatedly said that we in Azerbaijan are ready to turn the page after many years of confrontation with Armenia and start the stage of normal interaction. I think in this format we are approaching our goals. Russia is a friend and strategic partner for Azerbaijan, I would even say, more than a strategic partner, and the level of trust-based relations between Azerbaijan and Russia also contributed to finding a solution to the most sensitive issues with Armenia.
I think our meeting will yield good results, which will be visible very soon and the situation in the region will become safer and more predictable.
Mr President, thank you again for the invitation and for today’s meeting.
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan
: Mr President, allow me to thank you again for the invitation and, of course, for creating a positive working atmosphere.
I want to stress that we had a very positive meeting, a positive conversation. We discussed practically all the issues on the agenda. It was not a meeting meant to conceal problems. It was a meeting where we openly discussed all issues. I want to note that it is very positive that we clarified our positions and it turned out that we do not have disagreements on some issues which seemed to exist prior to the meeting.
I want to say that indeed, regarding reopening of all transport and economic routes in the region we stated that we have a common understanding of how the routes will operate.
The topic of delimitation, demarcation and the start of this process is not new, and we discussed it as well. We also adopted a trilateral Statement, which says that conditions need to be established for that, which means some sort of security and stability mechanisms on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan must be created.
Obviously, humanitarian issues were also discussed.
I generally hold a very positive view of today’s talks and today’s meeting. I want to thank our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, for the initiative. I think that if our talks gain momentum based on this meeting, we can expect real results.
I reaffirm the readiness of Armenia and the Government of Armenia, which got its mandate from the people of Armenia, to usher in the era of peaceful development for our country and for our region. We are committed to that and today’s meeting clearly contributed to the implementation of this agenda.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: To conclude, I want to stress again that the meeting was highly useful and timely. As has been said, we signed a Statement on the results of our today’s work. The public and the media can read that statement. It gives a more detailed account of what we worked on and what we agreed on.
You can see to my left our present to both our Armenian and Azerbaijani friends: an olive branch, a symbol of peace and wellbeing. I sincerely hope that today’s agreements will be followed on and will create conditions for further steps in normalising relation in the entire South Caucasus.

Meeting with President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev had a conversation at the Bocharov Ruchei residence in Sochi.
November 26, 2021
16:00
Sochi
1 of 3
With President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Thank you for coming – many questions have piled up.
Of course, we will focus on our trilateral meeting on settling the Nagorno-Karabakh problem.
I have just spoken with my colleagues – with the Deputy Prime Minister, you know him well. He deals with resolving economic issues and unblocking transport corridors. I have also spoken with the Defence Minister and with the FSB Director who is in charge of the Border Guard Service that is making a tangible contribution to settling the problem. In short, there are many issues to resolve.
However, I would still like to start our bilateral meeting by saying that next year we will mark the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. This is certainly a landmark and I suppose we should celebrate it befittingly.
I would like to say in this context that our strategic partnership is making steady headway. It is enough to say that despite all the problems with the pandemic and the related economic restrictions, our trade in the first nine months of this year has still increased by 11 percent – this is a good figure. There are 900 Russian companies operating in Azerbaijan and US$4.5 billion worth of direct Russian investment in its economy. Russia is one of Azerbaijan’s leading trade and economic partners.
Naturally, we continue our humanitarian contacts against this backdrop and first, as I always say at our meetings, I would like to thank you for the attention you attach to the development of the Russian language. There are 304 schools, or maybe even more – about 340 that teach Russian. At any rate, 34 percent of schoolchildren in Azerbaijan either receive instruction in Russian or study the Russian language.
This is a good figure that points to the striving of the Azerbaijani leaders to maintain close and diverse contacts with Russia. They are indeed diverse – we are developing both humanitarian relations and youth exchanges. We support many events at the universal human level – all this is creating a good atmosphere for developing relations in the future.
With regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, we will continue this discussion in a trilateral format after the Prime Minister of Armenia joins us. I think our peacekeepers play a positive role there, and the Russian-Turkish centre for monitoring the ceasefire is fully operational as well.
Unfortunately, there are problems, incidents and casualties. But this is precisely why we have gathered – in order to see what has been accomplished and what needs to be done by everyone to make sure that nothing of the kind ever happens again and to create proper conditions for calming the situation in the region so that people live in peace and countries continue to move forward.
I am delighted to see you. Welcome!
President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, thank you for inviting me. I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you again. During this year, we maintained a steady dialogue, met and often called each other on the telephone. Our bilateral relations are very satisfying.
But first, I would like to personally express my condolences to you in connection with the tragedy that occurred at a mine in the Kemerovo Region. Unfortunately, many people died. I sent a message yesterday, but today I would like to express condolences from the Azerbaijani people to you and all Russian people.
We have resolved many issues in a bilateral format, and we are calling our relations a strategic partnership. This is not just a phrase. It is a fact, and we are committed to further raising the level of our relations across all areas.
As you noted, trade is on the rise. Mutual interest in economic cooperation, including on the part of the business communities, is vast. Of course, we are very pleased with the fact that our relations cover many areas. We are now implementing seven roadmaps on the most economic spheres, transport, and humanitarian cooperation.
Thank you for your assessment of our efforts to promote and preserve the Russian language in Azerbaijan, including through tuition processes.
I would also like to thank you for creating conditions for Azerbaijani students to study in Russia. I looked up the latest data before this visit: over 15,000 Azerbaijanis, citizens of Azerbaijan, are studying at Russian universities, or as many as the number of students at a university. They are receiving a very good education and will automatically become a bridge connecting our countries.
This week illustrated the development of our relations. This week I met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Overchuk.
Ilham Aliyev: Yes. Yesterday evening I met with the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Your Special Representative for International Cultural Cooperation was in Baku during the past week on an extremely important mission: to develop contacts between the intellectuals and cultural figures of Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Russia’s active involvement. Another event this week was a large business conference of the Russian Export Centre and the Eximbank of Russia, in which over 30 Russian companies took part. In other words, this week provided a good example of our relationship in only some of the areas of our cooperation.
Of course, this evening we will have a detailed discussion on Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. I would like to point out that during the past year, since the deployment of the Russian peacekeeping forces [in Nagorno-Karabakh] on November 10, 2020, no serious incidents, no armed clashes or any other serious incidents took place in their zone of responsibility. There were sporadic incidents, but they did not amount to a systemwide crisis. There were clashes on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border, but it is not a zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeepers. Nevertheless, this makes us take a closer look at the developments. We need to talk, including in the trilateral format, about controlling and minimising risks and coordinating a comprehensive settlement of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.
We appreciate the role you are playing personally in this matter, the role of the senior officials of the Russian Government and, of course, the role of the Russian peacekeeping forces in maintaining peace in Karabakh. We hope that these efforts will continue next year and that they will produce equally good results.
Therefore, I would like to thank you once again for this invitation.
I would also like to say once again that I admire the breath-taking nature of this region. I believe that it is a real gem not only of Russia but of the world as a whole. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Unfortunately, I have to begin today’s meeting with a tragedy that happened in Kuzbass. Before we begin discussing the topics on today’s agenda, I would like us to observe a minute of silence in memory of all the victims in Kuzbass, both miners and rescuers.
(A minute of silence.)
Thank you.
I want to once again express condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to all those injured.
We are in constant contact with Governor Tsivilev; the Emergencies Minister has also reported to me. I ask the Government of the Russian Federation and the regional authorities to do everything to support the injured and the victims’ families. The Prosecutor General’s Office and the Investigative Committee have also been instructed to determine the causes of the tragedy.
Whenever such tragic events occur, we immediately start investigating what had caused them. We must make sure that nothing like this happens in the future, and to achieve that we need system-wide efforts and control over the execution of previous decisions. We will speak about that separately and in detail.
Meanwhile, let us return to the topic we have gathered to discuss. I will brief you on the outcome of my talks with President of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister of Armenia on the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement and on the agreements we reached during our meeting today.
As planned, we will have an in-depth discussion on the entire range of relations with our closest partners and neighbours. I am referring to relations with the CIS countries. Mr Kozak will make a report today, so I give him the floor. Go ahead, please.

The consultations were timed to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the Statement on a complete ceasefire and termination of all hostilities in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone of November 9, 2020.
The discussion focused on the progress in implementing the earlier agreements, further steps towards strengthening stability and restoring peaceful life in the region, and various aspects of restoring and developing trade, economic and transport links.
Following the meeting, Vladimir Putin, Ilham Aliyev
and Nikol Pashinyan
approved a Statement by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia and the President of the Russian Federation.
The leaders of the three countries also made statements on the outcome of the trilateral talks.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
I would like to begin by thanking you for making time to respond to my invitation and to come to Russia to review the work that has been carried out during the year since the adoption of the peace statement last year. We reaffirmed our agreements on the ceasefire and restoring normal life later in January. A lot has been accomplished during this time.
Unfortunately, not every issue have been settled yet. I am aware of the tragic incidents at the border when people on both sides get killed or wounded. These things require special attention on our part, and in fact, we are meeting today in order to avoid incidents like this in the future.
Overall, much has been accomplished during the year. First, no large-scale hostilities are taking place, which is very good in and of itself. During this time – and with our assistance – much has been done to have the refugees go back to their homes, with 53,000 people returning to their permanent place of residence. A good monitoring group has been created, and our contingent is working there. As far as I understand and according to assessments from both sides, it is doing a good job, providing safe living conditions for the locals. The Russian-Turkish ceasefire monitoring centre is operational. Most importantly, conditions are being created for a normal peaceful life.
A trilateral commission has been created at the level of deputy prime ministers of the governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia. My colleagues have reported to me on its progress. It is not easy, but, nevertheless, this work is at an advanced stage, and there is reason to believe that we will soon be able to not only confirm the work of the corresponding group on unblocking transport links, but also make the appropriate decisions that everyone needs.
I think this is, in fact, the goal of our efforts, namely, to create proper conditions for the revival of the region so people can feel safe and engage in economic activity and develop the economy. All this, of course, should have the most favourable effect on the living standards of the citizens of both countries.
This is of great importance for Russia since we have special relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. We were part of a single state for many centuries, we have deep historical ties, and I would not want to sever them, but on the contrary, we must strive to restore and maintain them in the future.
This is what I would like to say in my opening remarks.
President Aliyev and I have preliminarily discussed the issues that we will be working to approve in the course of our joint work. We have done this with the Armenian side in advance. I have repeatedly discussed these matters with the Prime Minister of Armenia, and we also exchanged views on this matter on our way to this venue. Mr Pashinyan will stay after the trilateral meeting, and we will have a bilateral meeting with him.
This is, perhaps, all I wanted to say to open our meeting. If our colleagues want or need to say something at the beginning of our meeting, please go ahead.
President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev: Thank you very much for the invitation, Mr President.
We in Azerbaijan greatly appreciate your personal participation in settling relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and of course, your involvement in harmonizing the text of the Statement last year.
As you mentioned, we met in this format early this year. Now we are meeting at the end of the year so we can review the results.
Of course, the situation is generally stable in the zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeepers. There have been no serious incidents or deliberate provocations. Isolated incidents were not common. So I would like to thank the Russian peacekeeping contingent for its good service: they are ensuring security in the region that was in a state of frozen conflict for many years and the site of a full-scale war last year.

Statement by President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia and President of the Russian Federation
November 10, 2020
This year, Azerbaijan has displayed a most constructive approach towards eliminating the consequences of the war and unblocking communications. I believe this issue is an important one as one of the items that have not yet been fulfilled, because the other items in the trilateral Statement, which was adopted and signed in November last year, have mostly been carried out. So I think, as we have already talked about this, it would be natural to discuss this, as well as the delimitation of borders between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We also appreciate Russia’s support, including advice, on this issue.
The border between Azerbaijan and Armenia has not been delimited, and we have repeatedly said on the record that we are willing to start the process of delimitation immediately. Further: we have suggested to Armenia, publicly, starting work on a peace treaty in order to put an official end to the confrontation, recognize each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty and live in the future as neighbours, learn to live as neighbours from scratch.
Of course, there is a host of other emerging problems, but they are being resolved promptly, in part with Russia’s help – your personal involvement and contributions from the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry, the Government and other bodies.
I would like to thank you again for the opportunity to hold this meeting today.
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan: Mr President, let me first thank you for the invitation and for organising this meeting.
But before moving on to today’s agenda, allow me to convey condolences on behalf of the Armenian people and from myself over the explosion in Kuzbass. It killed many people. I want to express my condolences to the families and friends of the miners that were killed.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Nikol Pashinyan: Your personal role and the role of the Russian Federation in stopping the war last year is obvious to everyone. After November 9, Russian peacekeepers were deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh, along the Lachin corridor. Russian peacekeepers and the Russian Federation are playing a key role in stabilising the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and the region in general.
However, I would like to emphasise that unfortunately the situation is not as stable as we would like it to be. Several dozen people have died on both sides since November 9, and other incidents occur in Nagorno-Karabakh as well. Since May 12 we have actually had a crisis at the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We believe Azerbaijani troops have invaded Armenia’s sovereign territory. Of course, some borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan have not been delimited or demarcated, but a state border exists and this defines the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia.
I cannot agree with the opinion of the President of Azerbaijan that all items except the unblocking of connections have been fulfilled. You know, and I have discussed this with you several times both in person and by telephone, that there is also the problem of hostages, other detainees and POWs, and this is a very important humanitarian issue. But I would like to say I believe that today we have met not only to voice these problems but also to discuss ways of resolving them.
I have also said more than once that Armenia is willing to start the process of delimitation and demarcation of the border. It is vital to us too to open, to unblock all transport and economic connections. We are sincerely interested in resolving these problems, and I hope we will review all of them today.
I saw that during your bilateral meeting with the President of Azerbaijan you talked about the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement problem. The President of Azerbaijan just mentioned the issue of peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Of course, we are also interested in this, and we believe the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement must be co-chaired by the OSCE Minsk Group.
I think we must and can discuss many issues in the bilateral format. I must say that officials from Azerbaijan and Armenia are already planning direct contacts. I think it is necessary to emphasise that these positions deserve special mention against the backdrop of the not-so-positive nuances.
The most important point about the current meeting is not simply to speak about whether certain problems exist. The main thing is that today we have managed to arrive at practical decisions (or as practical as we could make them) on stabilising the situation in the South Caucasus because we are responsible for peace, stability and security of people.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I think what you have just said is very important. I am referring to what the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia have said. Both sides are interested in normalising the situation and seeing it develop in a positive way.
(Addressing Nikol Pashinyan.) You have just mentioned the connections, the need to unblock them. President Aliyev has spoken about this as well.
Everyone is interested in this, including Russia, considering that we are all close countries, we are neighbours with large trade. Everyone is obviously interested in doing this. This is the first point.
The second point. We are still going to agree on the start of work to demarcate and delimit the borders: first, on delimitation and then on demarcation. We will of course speak about this today. That said, it is clear this is a difficult problem. We inherited it from the Soviet Union. There was no clear-cut border there. But we have an opportunity to talk about all this.
I agree with both my colleagues that the more contacts, including direct ones, the better. Direct bilateral contacts are altogether a priority. I know you are going to have another meeting in Brussels soon. You have agreed to go and meet there, and we welcome this as well. The more opportunities you have for direct communication, the better. I also talked about this recently with President of the European Council Charles Michel. He is looking forward to meeting with you. However, I hope we will take a step forward now, and it will be possible to take more steps at other venues. Let me repeat that we do welcome the involvement of our partners in this dialogue. The main point is to make it useful.
Thank you very much.
