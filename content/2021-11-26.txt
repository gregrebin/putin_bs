Meeting with Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan
November 26, 2021
As we said after our trilateral meeting, and I think you will agree with it, the meeting was instrumental and timely in view of the previous and current developments. We have gathered here to thwart any tragic events on the border and in general between the two countries and peoples, so as to move forward, as we said. All the region’s nations – Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, are interested in that.
Let us hope that the agreements we reached today will bring positive results as soon as possible.
Regarding our bilateral relations, we said repeatedly, and I want to stress it again, that relations between Russia and Armenia are of a strategic and allied nature rooted deep in history. We value that very much and we will continue maintaining this level of contacts in every possible way.
Economically, Russia is Armenia’s biggest trade and economic partner and the biggest investor in the Armenian economy. True, last year the turnover slumped somewhat. However, this year it is progressing rapidly, I would say, and I hope that we will reach the pre-pandemic level and move beyond it.
I am confident that now, after the trilateral format (you know and we agreed about the schedule that I meet with President of Azerbaijan prior to the trilateral meeting) during our bilateral meeting we have a chance to discuss the entire range of our bilateral ties.
Please.
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan
: Thank you, Mr President.
I want to thank you once again for the invitation and the organisation of today’s meetings.
Obviously, our bilateral relations are very important. You have already stressed that Russia and Armenia have strategic and allied relations. We have a very packed agenda practically in all areas. We are cooperating, and we have an agenda within CSTO, CIS, the Eurasian Economic Union.
However, I have to acknowledge that during our recent meetings we have discussed mostly the regional agenda because it has many interdependent issues.
I want to highlight again the role you played in stopping the 44-day war and deploying Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. Stabilising factors are crucial in our region. You have underscored a number of times today the importance of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. This issue is invariably discussed at our bilateral meetings as well.
Since we have already covered regional issues, I want to note that that despite economic and other difficulties, Russian investments in the Republic of Armenia seem to be on the rise this year. This is very important for us because I think it is a sign for investors that the Republic of Armenia is a very reliable country, and this matters a lot of us.
Of course, COVID-related economic problems, regretfully, persist but we recently noticed with satisfaction the stepping-up of the turnover within the Eurasian Economic Union. This is very important, too.
I hope we will be able to ultimately arrive at the solution on opening all economic and transport communications in our region, which will do a great deal to energise trade and economic relations within the EAEU and Armenian-Russian bilateral ties.
Thank you once again.
Vladimir Putin: I completely agree with you. These communications, transport routes we spoke about in the trilateral format today, are crucial for all the countries in the region, including Russia, because we are interested in these transport routes with our strategic partner Armenia being reliable, diversified and readily available all year round, which is key. I hope we will move onto the final stages of this work. There are some points I saw today that require additional coordination but they are not of fundamental nature, which also became obvious during our discussions today.
As for purely economic and pragmatic issues, I can say that everything has been basically agreed on, so I have no doubt that the progress will be noticeable and positive very soon. And you are absolutely right and I agree with you, we spoke about this during the trilateral discussion: as soon as people see how everything has begun working, the region will have a different atmosphere, there is no doubt about that. Therefore, I want to thank you for today’s constructive conversation.
Meanwhile, we also have an opportunity to speak about bilateral issues. We maintain regular contacts, we often meet and speak regularly over the phone. But today we have a chance to speak in person, so let us seize this opportunity.
Thank you very much.

Statements by leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia following trilateral talks
November 26, 2021
20:00
Sochi
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
To conclude our trilateral meeting, I would like to thank again my colleagues, the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia, for agreeing to come to Russia today and to discuss the situation taking shape in the region in general and as regards the settlement of the Karabakh problem.
I should say from the start that our talks today were very constructive. It was an in-depth analysis of the current situation. We gave credit to the efforts of the Russian peacekeepers, border guards and those specialists who conduct mine clearing and ensure people’s return to their homes.
I also want to stress that we agreed on a number of issues which I consider vital. The first of them is the establishment of mechanisms for border demarcation and delimitation between the two states, and we agreed to complete this work by the end of the year. I hope it will happen as soon as possible. There are no obstacles to establishing such mechanisms.
Second, I would like to mention a very important and sensitive point related to humanitarian issues, and we have also made good progress here.
Finally, we held an in-depth discussion on economic issues, on developing economic ties, and spoke about unblocking transport corridors as the first step. This concerns both railway and road traffic.
I think we ought to thank our deputy prime ministers who have been working on this issue for a long time, and we agreed that next week they will meet in Moscow to sum up some of the results and announce the decisions we approved today.
Thank you very much once again for today’s work. I want to thank both the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia.
President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
To begin with, let me once again express my gratitude for today’s meeting as well as for your efforts to create a favourable atmosphere in resolving issues between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
A year has passed since the trilateral Statement put an end to the war between the two countries, and we generally view this year as a positive one. I would like to use this opportunity to thank you again, Mr President, and the Russian Defence Ministry for the peacekeeping efforts in Karabakh. There have been no serious incidents in the zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeeping forces.
There have been many important events during this year. This is our second meeting in this format; the first one was held at the beginning of the year and this one is to finish the year. I do not want to repeat what the President of Russia said about delimitation, demarcation and unblocking of transport arteries. Today we have had a very detailed and I would say sincere talk on all these issues. We openly discussed our plans that cause concern of both parties, and I think the key is that the decisions we made regarding settling arguments and disputes will contribute to making the situation in the South Caucasus safer and more predictable.
Also, as the President of Russia noted, humanitarian issues were discussed. Azerbaijan always consistently advocated the observance of all humanitarian norms, be it during hostilities or afterwards. I must say that after the hostilities ended, over 100 Armenian servicemen were returned to Armenia, including one today who had been wounded and was treated by Azerbaijani doctors, as well as a civilian who got lost on our territory. It means we have always proceeded from the primacy of the principle of humanism and we are set to proceed in that direction. We see the same commitment from the Armenian side to build conditions for the situation in the region to be more predictable.
I repeatedly said that we in Azerbaijan are ready to turn the page after many years of confrontation with Armenia and start the stage of normal interaction. I think in this format we are approaching our goals. Russia is a friend and strategic partner for Azerbaijan, I would even say, more than a strategic partner, and the level of trust-based relations between Azerbaijan and Russia also contributed to finding a solution to the most sensitive issues with Armenia.
I think our meeting will yield good results, which will be visible very soon and the situation in the region will become safer and more predictable.
Mr President, thank you again for the invitation and for today’s meeting.
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan
: Mr President, allow me to thank you again for the invitation and, of course, for creating a positive working atmosphere.
I want to stress that we had a very positive meeting, a positive conversation. We discussed practically all the issues on the agenda. It was not a meeting meant to conceal problems. It was a meeting where we openly discussed all issues. I want to note that it is very positive that we clarified our positions and it turned out that we do not have disagreements on some issues which seemed to exist prior to the meeting.
I want to say that indeed, regarding reopening of all transport and economic routes in the region we stated that we have a common understanding of how the routes will operate.
The topic of delimitation, demarcation and the start of this process is not new, and we discussed it as well. We also adopted a trilateral Statement, which says that conditions need to be established for that, which means some sort of security and stability mechanisms on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan must be created.
Obviously, humanitarian issues were also discussed.
I generally hold a very positive view of today’s talks and today’s meeting. I want to thank our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, for the initiative. I think that if our talks gain momentum based on this meeting, we can expect real results.
I reaffirm the readiness of Armenia and the Government of Armenia, which got its mandate from the people of Armenia, to usher in the era of peaceful development for our country and for our region. We are committed to that and today’s meeting clearly contributed to the implementation of this agenda.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: To conclude, I want to stress again that the meeting was highly useful and timely. As has been said, we signed a Statement on the results of our today’s work. The public and the media can read that statement. It gives a more detailed account of what we worked on and what we agreed on.
You can see to my left our present to both our Armenian and Azerbaijani friends: an olive branch, a symbol of peace and wellbeing. I sincerely hope that today’s agreements will be followed on and will create conditions for further steps in normalising relation in the entire South Caucasus.

Meeting with President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev had a conversation at the Bocharov Ruchei residence in Sochi.

With President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Thank you for coming – many questions have piled up.
Of course, we will focus on our trilateral meeting on settling the Nagorno-Karabakh problem.
I have just spoken with my colleagues – with the Deputy Prime Minister, you know him well. He deals with resolving economic issues and unblocking transport corridors. I have also spoken with the Defence Minister and with the FSB Director who is in charge of the Border Guard Service that is making a tangible contribution to settling the problem. In short, there are many issues to resolve.
However, I would still like to start our bilateral meeting by saying that next year we will mark the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. This is certainly a landmark and I suppose we should celebrate it befittingly.
I would like to say in this context that our strategic partnership is making steady headway. It is enough to say that despite all the problems with the pandemic and the related economic restrictions, our trade in the first nine months of this year has still increased by 11 percent – this is a good figure. There are 900 Russian companies operating in Azerbaijan and US$4.5 billion worth of direct Russian investment in its economy. Russia is one of Azerbaijan’s leading trade and economic partners.
Naturally, we continue our humanitarian contacts against this backdrop and first, as I always say at our meetings, I would like to thank you for the attention you attach to the development of the Russian language. There are 304 schools, or maybe even more – about 340 that teach Russian. At any rate, 34 percent of schoolchildren in Azerbaijan either receive instruction in Russian or study the Russian language.
This is a good figure that points to the striving of the Azerbaijani leaders to maintain close and diverse contacts with Russia. They are indeed diverse – we are developing both humanitarian relations and youth exchanges. We support many events at the universal human level – all this is creating a good atmosphere for developing relations in the future.
With regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, we will continue this discussion in a trilateral format after the Prime Minister of Armenia joins us. I think our peacekeepers play a positive role there, and the Russian-Turkish centre for monitoring the ceasefire is fully operational as well.
Unfortunately, there are problems, incidents and casualties. But this is precisely why we have gathered – in order to see what has been accomplished and what needs to be done by everyone to make sure that nothing of the kind ever happens again and to create proper conditions for calming the situation in the region so that people live in peace and countries continue to move forward.
I am delighted to see you. Welcome!
President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, thank you for inviting me. I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you again. During this year, we maintained a steady dialogue, met and often called each other on the telephone. Our bilateral relations are very satisfying.
But first, I would like to personally express my condolences to you in connection with the tragedy that occurred at a mine in the Kemerovo Region. Unfortunately, many people died. I sent a message yesterday, but today I would like to express condolences from the Azerbaijani people to you and all Russian people.
We have resolved many issues in a bilateral format, and we are calling our relations a strategic partnership. This is not just a phrase. It is a fact, and we are committed to further raising the level of our relations across all areas.
As you noted, trade is on the rise. Mutual interest in economic cooperation, including on the part of the business communities, is vast. Of course, we are very pleased with the fact that our relations cover many areas. We are now implementing seven roadmaps on the most economic spheres, transport, and humanitarian cooperation.
Thank you for your assessment of our efforts to promote and preserve the Russian language in Azerbaijan, including through tuition processes.
I would also like to thank you for creating conditions for Azerbaijani students to study in Russia. I looked up the latest data before this visit: over 15,000 Azerbaijanis, citizens of Azerbaijan, are studying at Russian universities, or as many as the number of students at a university. They are receiving a very good education and will automatically become a bridge connecting our countries.
This week illustrated the development of our relations. This week I met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Overchuk.
Ilham Aliyev: Yes. Yesterday evening I met with the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Your Special Representative for International Cultural Cooperation was in Baku during the past week on an extremely important mission: to develop contacts between the intellectuals and cultural figures of Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Russia’s active involvement. Another event this week was a large business conference of the Russian Export Centre and the Eximbank of Russia, in which over 30 Russian companies took part. In other words, this week provided a good example of our relationship in only some of the areas of our cooperation.
Of course, this evening we will have a detailed discussion on Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. I would like to point out that during the past year, since the deployment of the Russian peacekeeping forces [in Nagorno-Karabakh] on November 10, 2020, no serious incidents, no armed clashes or any other serious incidents took place in their zone of responsibility. There were sporadic incidents, but they did not amount to a systemwide crisis. There were clashes on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border, but it is not a zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeepers. Nevertheless, this makes us take a closer look at the developments. We need to talk, including in the trilateral format, about controlling and minimising risks and coordinating a comprehensive settlement of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.
We appreciate the role you are playing personally in this matter, the role of the senior officials of the Russian Government and, of course, the role of the Russian peacekeeping forces in maintaining peace in Karabakh. We hope that these efforts will continue next year and that they will produce equally good results.
Therefore, I would like to thank you once again for this invitation.
I would also like to say once again that I admire the breath-taking nature of this region. I believe that it is a real gem not only of Russia but of the world as a whole. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
