President of the People'S Republic of China Hu Jintao (Retranslated from Russian): Mr President,
I am very pleased to see you again.
A couple of days ago we talked in Washington, but we did not cover all the subjects. Today, I am ready to continue the exchange of opinion on issues of common interest.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President,
I am also very pleased to meet you.
Although this is the second time we are attending forums which focus on the financial crisis, this will not prevent us from discussing the other aspects of our full-fledged strategic partnership. Now we have an additional opportunity.
I would also like to inform you that following our meeting we have approved the plan [the Russian-Chinese Plan of Action] for 2009â€“2012. I have already made the relevant instructions, and work is underway.
Hu Jintao: Today, the international political and economic landscape is going through the most profound and complicated changes since the Cold War. In this context, China and Russia should continue promoting their strategic cooperation.
