Peru, Lima
President of the People'S Republic of China Hu Jintao (Retranslated from Russian): Mr President,
I am very pleased to see you again.
A couple of days ago we talked in Washington, but we did not cover all the subjects. Today, I am ready to continue the exchange of opinion on issues of common interest.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President,
I am also very pleased to meet you.
Although this is the second time we are attending forums which focus on the financial crisis, this will not prevent us from discussing the other aspects of our full-fledged strategic partnership. Now we have an additional opportunity.
I would also like to inform you that following our meeting we have approved the plan [the Russian-Chinese Plan of Action] for 2009â€“2012. I have already made the relevant instructions, and work is underway.
Hu Jintao: Today, the international political and economic landscape is going through the most profound and complicated changes since the Cold War. In this context, China and Russia should continue promoting their strategic cooperation.

Beginning of the Meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush
November 23, 2008
14:23
Peru, Lima
U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: It's an interesting moment because I've had a lot of meetings with Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin. This will be my last meeting as the sitting President with the leader of Russia. We've had our agreements, we've had our disagreements. I've tried to work at making it a cordial relationship though, so that when we need to work together we can, and when we disagree we're able to do so in a way that is respectful to our two nations.
I thank you for coming today and appreciate your time.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Thank you, George. And in general, though we agree on some points and strongly disagree on others, I would like to say that we have worked well and will continue working well now.
U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Thank you.
