An important feature of your biography is that you served as a deputy prime minister of the Saratov Region Government. This means that you are aware of what real life, a real economy is all about. You also held a post at the Economic Development Ministry of Russia and I am sure you have focused on the Ryazan Region, which is the centre, the heartland of Russia.
Please, I would like to hear how you see the region’s main problems and development trends.
Pavel Malkov: Mr President, of course, I have visited Ryazan on numerous occasions both on official business and for personal needs. It is a very interesting and vibrant region, remarkable for its history, culture, and, of course, people.
People are the main priority. The first thing to do is to sort out problems that are of concern for the people and start solving them one by one. In parallel, we will devise a regional development strategy, a vision for positioning the region in the current economic environment. I think about a month will suffice for this purpose. If trust is placed in me, I am ready to report on these proposals.
Vladimir Putin: All right. Within a month?
Pavel Malkov: Yes, sir.
Vladimir Putin: Good. Then it is a deal.
I hope that you will plunge deep into the Ryazan Region’s problems. Pavel Malkov: I certainly will.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Pavel Malkov: Thank you very much.

Mr Busargin, what is your assessment of the current state of affairs and short-term prospects?

Last year, the region had a budget surplus for the first time in ten years. If you vest your confidence in me, I will try to use the best of my experience and justify your expectations.
Vladimir Putin: You do have significant experience and your overall results have been quite satisfactory. You know what you are doing.
Mr Busargin, I want to wish you success and I hope that your knowledge, experience and understanding of the region will benefit the people and the Saratov Region.
I am certain that this region’s tremendous potential will be able to multiply under your leadership and will be used in the best possible way.

Video address to participants and guests of the finals of the 11th Night Hockey League National Festival.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
I welcome you to the opening of the final stage of the 11th Night Hockey League National Festival and congratulate the players, coaches and fans of the tournament on this great and spectacular event, a true festival for ice hockey fans.
Russia sincerely loves this wonderful sport. It is only natural that the Night Hockey League has won broad recognition throughout the country and has brought thousands of ice hockey players together from most of the regions in our country.
This tournament is unparalleled because it attracts ice hockey fans of different generations: renowned masters, sport old-timers and rookies who decided to set up their own teams to win and to test their spirit.
Getting to the top and winning the trophy for the season is an objective worth pursuing for such ambitious, energetic and strong-willed people. So, the final stage of the traditional Night Hockey League National Festival in Sochi invariably attracts fans with its compelling and uncompromising matches, highlights and unforgettable emotions.
I believe the League will continue to attract more players, introduce the values of fitness and a healthy lifestyle to people of different ages and occupations, and contribute to ice hockey popularity, all while reminding people of its history and our legendary champions’ achievements who personally contributed to the promotion of sport in our country.
I wish you good luck in your ice battles and all the best. And as they say: may the best win!
