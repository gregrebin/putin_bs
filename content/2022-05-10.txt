An important feature of your biography is that you served as a deputy prime minister of the Saratov Region Government. This means that you are aware of what real life, a real economy is all about. You also held a post at the Economic Development Ministry of Russia and I am sure you have focused on the Ryazan Region, which is the centre, the heartland of Russia.
Please, I would like to hear how you see the region’s main problems and development trends.
Pavel Malkov: Mr President, of course, I have visited Ryazan on numerous occasions both on official business and for personal needs. It is a very interesting and vibrant region, remarkable for its history, culture, and, of course, people.
People are the main priority. The first thing to do is to sort out problems that are of concern for the people and start solving them one by one. In parallel, we will devise a regional development strategy, a vision for positioning the region in the current economic environment. I think about a month will suffice for this purpose. If trust is placed in me, I am ready to report on these proposals.
Vladimir Putin: All right. Within a month?
Pavel Malkov: Yes, sir.
Vladimir Putin: Good. Then it is a deal.
I hope that you will plunge deep into the Ryazan Region’s problems. Pavel Malkov: I certainly will.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Pavel Malkov: Thank you very much.

Roman Busargin: Good afternoon, Mr President.

Mr Busargin, what is your assessment of the current state of affairs and short-term prospects?

Last year, the region had a budget surplus for the first time in ten years. If you vest your confidence in me, I will try to use the best of my experience and justify your expectations.
Vladimir Putin: You do have significant experience and your overall results have been quite satisfactory. You know what you are doing.
Mr Busargin, I want to wish you success and I hope that your knowledge, experience and understanding of the region will benefit the people and the Saratov Region.
I am certain that this region’s tremendous potential will be able to multiply under your leadership and will be used in the best possible way.

Video address to participants and guests of the finals of the 11th Night Hockey League National Festival.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
I welcome you to the opening of the final stage of the 11th Night Hockey League National Festival and congratulate the players, coaches and fans of the tournament on this great and spectacular event, a true festival for ice hockey fans.
Russia sincerely loves this wonderful sport. It is only natural that the Night Hockey League has won broad recognition throughout the country and has brought thousands of ice hockey players together from most of the regions in our country.
This tournament is unparalleled because it attracts ice hockey fans of different generations: renowned masters, sport old-timers and rookies who decided to set up their own teams to win and to test their spirit.
Getting to the top and winning the trophy for the season is an objective worth pursuing for such ambitious, energetic and strong-willed people. So, the final stage of the traditional Night Hockey League National Festival in Sochi invariably attracts fans with its compelling and uncompromising matches, highlights and unforgettable emotions.
I believe the League will continue to attract more players, introduce the values of fitness and a healthy lifestyle to people of different ages and occupations, and contribute to ice hockey popularity, all while reminding people of its history and our legendary champions’ achievements who personally contributed to the promotion of sport in our country.
I wish you good luck in your ice battles and all the best. And as they say: may the best win!

The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Mazur has been appointed Acting Governor of the Tomsk Region.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Mazur.
Vladimir Mazur: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Mazur, I have seen your impressive work record. You started out as a rank-and-file farmer in Siberia, and you know Siberia very well. It would be no exaggeration to say that you later received a brilliant education and defended a PhD thesis.
You have such a large family with five children. These are all your children?
Vladimir Mazur: Yes, I have a son, a daughter and triplet daughters.
Vladimir Putin: This is great, my congratulations. That is a big achievement in life.
To the best of my knowledge, you worked as Deputy Governor of the Tyumen Region, and you headed the administration of Tobolsk. On the whole, you have good knowledge of Siberia.
What do you think about the development of the Tomsk Region, which ranks among key Siberian and Russian territories? It has tremendous potential, not to mention its education cluster.
Go ahead, please.
Vladimir Mazur: Thank you, Mr President.
Indeed, the city of Tomsk has a very impressive potential. It is a region of talented and hard-working people, including scientists and farmers tilling high-risk land plots.
Of course, my current high-priority tasks include efforts to evaluate the region’s socioeconomic development and healthcare system. We need to make people’s lives better, more comfortable and safer.
Of course, it is now important to focus on the creation of jobs and a new economic potential that the region, without doubt, boasts. Mr President, considering our experience, the people and we will not let you down, and I am confident that we will achieve good results.
Vladimir Putin: Good, Mr Mazur.
I wish you every success and good luck.
Vladimir Mazur. Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: We will discuss specific aspects of your work later on.
I wish you all the best, and good luck.
Vladimir Mazur: Thank you very much, and I wish you all the best.

Alexander Sokolov has been appointed Acting Governor of the Kirov Region.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sokolov, good afternoon.

Alexander Sokolov: Yes indeed, it was a page in my career.

Vladimir Putin: After that, as I see, you showed vigorous growth, and eventually earned a MGIMO degree. It was MGIMO, wasn’t it?
Alexander Sokolov: Yes, I have a master’s from MGIMO.
I started out as a history teacher. I have teacher’s diploma. After doing my practicum, I was offered a position in one of the schools in my home town in the Kostroma Region. I was a fifth-year student, and tried it. I think that helped me in the future, because communication with people, communication with children is very important.
Vladimir Putin: Yes.
Mr Sokolov, what were your duties as first deputy governor of the Kostroma Region?
Alexander Sokolov: I was a deputy in charge of domestic policy. In addition, I oversaw culture, cultural heritage and youth affairs. Domestic policy also involves interaction with all municipalities, political parties and public organisations.
Vladimir Putin: I see.
The Kirov Region also has major industrial facilities, with good prospects, as well as resources. Have you looked at this? Have you got an idea of the main areas of work?
Alexander Sokolov: Yes. My duties now include interaction with regional authorities, so of course, I am studying the regions, and I have looked at the Kirov Region.
I cannot say that I know of every problem the region is facing, but as I understand, it has a developed timber industry, industrial enterprises and heavy industry. There is good experience in agriculture and construction.
I think that together with the people who work there, together with entrepreneurs, together with the heads of municipalities, we will be able to resolve many issues.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, you just mentioned the right things: together with the people who work there.
And Mr Sokolov, you will need to know by heart both the region’s problems and its promising areas for development, of course. I very much hope you will cooperate with your colleagues who work there, and with the relevant government agencies here in Moscow – this should be the easy part for you, with your experience in the Executive Office – you will need to study every aspect properly, and then, in cooperation with the Government and with your colleagues on the ground, in the Kirov Region, to outline the region’s development goals.
Alexander Sokolov: Of course, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: And ways to achieve these goals, of course.
Alexander Sokolov: Yes. You are so right about relying on the local people. Local initiative coming from the people is important, and in the Kirov Region, the people are both enterprising and, what is also very important, extremely patriotic – both in relation to Russia and to their native region. I see this as an important resource for development.
Vladimir Putin: This is true.
All right, Mr Sokolov. We will talk more and get back to these matters.
Thank you and good luck.
Alexander Sokolov: Thank you.

Meeting with Yury Zaitsev
Yury Zaitsev has been appointed Acting Head of the Republic of Mari El.
May 10, 2022
20:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
Yury Zaitsev has been appointed Acting Head of the Republic of Mari El.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Zaitsev.
Yury Zaitsev: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Zaitsev, I have looked at the documents about your professional experience. You are from the Moscow Region, and you have a good education, serious education, and a long work record.
Of course, your current post as head of the Government of Kalmykia is a high position that implies many responsibilities. You also know the republic where you will now be appointed to work.
Mr Zaitsev, I would like you to tell me, after you have considered the situation in Mari El, what you consider to be the most important issues and which of them should be given priority attention.
Go ahead, please.
Yury Zaitsev: Thank you, Mr President.
To date, I have analysed the main parameters of the republic. I have formed a general picture, and I would like to tell you the following about what I plan to do in the region first of all.
The socioeconomic situation is very important: how people live, what they want and what problems they are facing. When I form this vision and translate it into a comprehensive action programme, I will be ready to present it to you, to tell you what I plan to do to improve the region, possibly in person, if I may.
In principle, Kalmykia and Mari El are similar in some respects, notably, the economy, and the difference in their budgets is relatively small. Therefore, I hope to form an understanding of the situation rather quickly.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Mr Zaitsev, I think it was a slip of the tongue when you said that it is important to know how people live. It is in fact the most important thing.
Yury Zaitsev: Mr President, I fully agree with you on this.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, it is the main issue. When you know how people live, what needs they have and what is lacking in their lives now, you will be able to formulate your development plans based on this knowledge.
I sincerely hope that you will do this quickly and report on this to me.
Agreed?
Yury Zaitsev: I certainly will, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Yury Zaitsev: Thank you very much.
