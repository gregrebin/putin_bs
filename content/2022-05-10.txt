An important feature of your biography is that you served as a deputy prime minister of the Saratov Region Government. This means that you are aware of what real life, a real economy is all about. You also held a post at the Economic Development Ministry of Russia and I am sure you have focused on the Ryazan Region, which is the centre, the heartland of Russia.
Please, I would like to hear how you see the region’s main problems and development trends.
Pavel Malkov: Mr President, of course, I have visited Ryazan on numerous occasions both on official business and for personal needs. It is a very interesting and vibrant region, remarkable for its history, culture, and, of course, people.
People are the main priority. The first thing to do is to sort out problems that are of concern for the people and start solving them one by one. In parallel, we will devise a regional development strategy, a vision for positioning the region in the current economic environment. I think about a month will suffice for this purpose. If trust is placed in me, I am ready to report on these proposals.
Vladimir Putin: All right. Within a month?
Pavel Malkov: Yes, sir.
Vladimir Putin: Good. Then it is a deal.
I hope that you will plunge deep into the Ryazan Region’s problems. Pavel Malkov: I certainly will.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Pavel Malkov: Thank you very much.

Roman Busargin has been appointed Acting Governor of the Saratov Region.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Busargin.
Roman Busargin: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: You need no introduction to the Saratov Region. I can see that you were born and have lived and worked there your entire life. Now you serve as the deputy chair of the regional government, dealing with local economic activities, which is a key area of focus for any region.
Mr Busargin, what is your assessment of the current state of affairs and short-term prospects?
Roman Busargin: Mr President, we have certain development prospects outlined, primarily concerning socioeconomic issues, population issues and investment potential.
Last year, the region had a budget surplus for the first time in ten years. If you vest your confidence in me, I will try to use the best of my experience and justify your expectations.
Vladimir Putin: You do have significant experience and your overall results have been quite satisfactory. You know what you are doing.
Mr Busargin, I want to wish you success and I hope that your knowledge, experience and understanding of the region will benefit the people and the Saratov Region.
I am certain that this region’s tremendous potential will be able to multiply under your leadership and will be used in the best possible way.

I will do my utmost to justify your confidence, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Good, Mr Busargin. Good luck.

Video address to participants and guests of the finals of the 11th Night Hockey League National Festival.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
I welcome you to the opening of the final stage of the 11th Night Hockey League National Festival and congratulate the players, coaches and fans of the tournament on this great and spectacular event, a true festival for ice hockey fans.
Russia sincerely loves this wonderful sport. It is only natural that the Night Hockey League has won broad recognition throughout the country and has brought thousands of ice hockey players together from most of the regions in our country.
This tournament is unparalleled because it attracts ice hockey fans of different generations: renowned masters, sport old-timers and rookies who decided to set up their own teams to win and to test their spirit.
Getting to the top and winning the trophy for the season is an objective worth pursuing for such ambitious, energetic and strong-willed people. So, the final stage of the traditional Night Hockey League National Festival in Sochi invariably attracts fans with its compelling and uncompromising matches, highlights and unforgettable emotions.
I believe the League will continue to attract more players, introduce the values of fitness and a healthy lifestyle to people of different ages and occupations, and contribute to ice hockey popularity, all while reminding people of its history and our legendary champions’ achievements who personally contributed to the promotion of sport in our country.
I wish you good luck in your ice battles and all the best. And as they say: may the best win!

The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Mazur has been appointed Acting Governor of the Tomsk Region.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Mazur.
Vladimir Mazur: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Mazur, I have seen your impressive work record. You started out as a rank-and-file farmer in Siberia, and you know Siberia very well. It would be no exaggeration to say that you later received a brilliant education and defended a PhD thesis.
You have such a large family with five children. These are all your children?
Vladimir Mazur: Yes, I have a son, a daughter and triplet daughters.
Vladimir Putin: This is great, my congratulations. That is a big achievement in life.
To the best of my knowledge, you worked as Deputy Governor of the Tyumen Region, and you headed the administration of Tobolsk. On the whole, you have good knowledge of Siberia.
What do you think about the development of the Tomsk Region, which ranks among key Siberian and Russian territories? It has tremendous potential, not to mention its education cluster.
Go ahead, please.
Vladimir Mazur: Thank you, Mr President.
Indeed, the city of Tomsk has a very impressive potential. It is a region of talented and hard-working people, including scientists and farmers tilling high-risk land plots.
Of course, my current high-priority tasks include efforts to evaluate the region’s socioeconomic development and healthcare system. We need to make people’s lives better, more comfortable and safer.
Of course, it is now important to focus on the creation of jobs and a new economic potential that the region, without doubt, boasts. Mr President, considering our experience, the people and we will not let you down, and I am confident that we will achieve good results.
Vladimir Putin: Good, Mr Mazur.
I wish you every success and good luck.
Vladimir Mazur. Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: We will discuss specific aspects of your work later on.
I wish you all the best, and good luck.
Vladimir Mazur: Thank you very much, and I wish you all the best.

Alexander Sokolov has been appointed Acting Governor of the Kirov Region.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sokolov, good afternoon.
Alexander Sokolov: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Sokolov, you had such a noble start to your career, as an after-school teacher.
Alexander Sokolov: Yes indeed, it was a page in my career.

Vladimir Putin: After that, as I see, you showed vigorous growth, and eventually earned a MGIMO degree. It was MGIMO, wasn’t it?
Alexander Sokolov: Yes, I have a master’s from MGIMO.
I started out as a history teacher. I have teacher’s diploma. After doing my practicum, I was offered a position in one of the schools in my home town in the Kostroma Region. I was a fifth-year student, and tried it. I think that helped me in the future, because communication with people, communication with children is very important.
Vladimir Putin: Yes.
Mr Sokolov, what were your duties as first deputy governor of the Kostroma Region?
Alexander Sokolov: I was a deputy in charge of domestic policy. In addition, I oversaw culture, cultural heritage and youth affairs. Domestic policy also involves interaction with all municipalities, political parties and public organisations.
Vladimir Putin: I see.
The Kirov Region also has major industrial facilities, with good prospects, as well as resources. Have you looked at this? Have you got an idea of the main areas of work?
Alexander Sokolov: Yes. My duties now include interaction with regional authorities, so of course, I am studying the regions, and I have looked at the Kirov Region.
I cannot say that I know of every problem the region is facing, but as I understand, it has a developed timber industry, industrial enterprises and heavy industry. There is good experience in agriculture and construction.
I think that together with the people who work there, together with entrepreneurs, together with the heads of municipalities, we will be able to resolve many issues.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, you just mentioned the right things: together with the people who work there.
And Mr Sokolov, you will need to know by heart both the region’s problems and its promising areas for development, of course. I very much hope you will cooperate with your colleagues who work there, and with the relevant government agencies here in Moscow – this should be the easy part for you, with your experience in the Executive Office – you will need to study every aspect properly, and then, in cooperation with the Government and with your colleagues on the ground, in the Kirov Region, to outline the region’s development goals.
Alexander Sokolov: Of course, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: And ways to achieve these goals, of course.
Alexander Sokolov: Yes. You are so right about relying on the local people. Local initiative coming from the people is important, and in the Kirov Region, the people are both enterprising and, what is also very important, extremely patriotic – both in relation to Russia and to their native region. I see this as an important resource for development.
Vladimir Putin: This is true.
All right, Mr Sokolov. We will talk more and get back to these matters.
Thank you and good luck.
Alexander Sokolov: Thank you.

Meeting with Yury Zaitsev
Yury Zaitsev has been appointed Acting Head of the Republic of Mari El.
May 10, 2022

The Kremlin, Moscow
Yury Zaitsev has been appointed Acting Head of the Republic of Mari El.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Zaitsev.
Yury Zaitsev: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Zaitsev, I have looked at the documents about your professional experience. You are from the Moscow Region, and you have a good education, serious education, and a long work record.
Of course, your current post as head of the Government of Kalmykia is a high position that implies many responsibilities. You also know the republic where you will now be appointed to work.
Mr Zaitsev, I would like you to tell me, after you have considered the situation in Mari El, what you consider to be the most important issues and which of them should be given priority attention.
Go ahead, please.
Yury Zaitsev: Thank you, Mr President.
To date, I have analysed the main parameters of the republic. I have formed a general picture, and I would like to tell you the following about what I plan to do in the region first of all.
The socioeconomic situation is very important: how people live, what they want and what problems they are facing. When I form this vision and translate it into a comprehensive action programme, I will be ready to present it to you, to tell you what I plan to do to improve the region, possibly in person, if I may.
In principle, Kalmykia and Mari El are similar in some respects, notably, the economy, and the difference in their budgets is relatively small. Therefore, I hope to form an understanding of the situation rather quickly.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Mr Zaitsev, I think it was a slip of the tongue when you said that it is important to know how people live. It is in fact the most important thing.
Yury Zaitsev: Mr President, I fully agree with you on this.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, it is the main issue. When you know how people live, what needs they have and what is lacking in their lives now, you will be able to formulate your development plans based on this knowledge.
I sincerely hope that you will do this quickly and report on this to me.
Agreed?
Yury Zaitsev: I certainly will, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Yury Zaitsev: Thank you very much.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today we will discuss the situation concerning fires in Russia and revisit the range of issues related to the prevention of forest fires. It is important to have an in-depth discussion and take additional action, if necessary, to alleviate the current problems. Generally, we should discuss improving the fire prevention efforts.
At the moment, several regions are fighting fires in residential places, with significant material damage becoming apparent. Unfortunately, victims have been reported as well.
I am talking about wildfires, landscape and man-caused fires. Regardless of their origin, these fires pose a direct threat to people’s lives and health, causing tangible and often irreparable harm to nature and wildlife, as well as adversely impacting the economy and social life.
Colleagues, I would like to ask the Acting Emergencies Minister to start the meeting with his report on the current situation. Governors of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Kemerovo Region, the Omsk Region and the Kurgan Region, please report on the state of affairs in your regions. I have already discussed the matter with several colleagues, and I believe it is necessary to have a discussion involving a broader range of participants. Please tell us what kind of additional help you require from the federal government and report on what kind of assistance is provided to local residents.
Please note that we must not allow a repetition of the situation last year, when the wildfires were the longest and most intense in several years. Fire management requires a complete overhaul where it is necessary. I will tell you later what decisions have already been made. Still, if we see that something is not working or is not sufficiently effective, changes must be made. Firefighting efforts must be more efficient, better organised and consistent, with all preventive measures being raised to a higher standard.
I have already spoken about the substantial damage that fire causes to our citizens, the economy, the social sphere and wildlife. There is another extremely important aspect. I have already noted – and everybody understands this – that forests act as an environmental shield for our country and the entire planet. This plays a key role in absorbing global greenhouse emissions. Therefore, large-scale fires undermine our climate change efforts. This is a matter of principal importance for our country and the entire world.
I want to stress that, as I have just said, all the decisions necessary for effective action against wildfires were made at the federal level in the past. For example, the law specifies the authority, responsibilities and liability of government bodies and forest land lessees when it comes to eliminating fires and restoring forests.
The law also regulates matters concerning landscape fires, which are fires breaking out on open land, in fields, meadows and steppes and which often spread to forests. Since January 1, 2022, regional and municipal authorities have been responsible for eliminating such fires. As per your request, funding is being allocated.
As part of the Environment national project, the regions are upgrading specialised fire-fighting equipment. The main issue that representatives of our federal constituent entities have been raising repeatedly is insufficient funding for the wildfire fighting effort. I understand that this matter has been resolved.
In this context, I would like to note an important decision made following the XX Congress of the United Russia party, which instructed the Government to additionally allocate at least 8 billion rubles every year to regional authorities for wildfire prevention efforts. These funds were calculated and agreed upon with the constituent entities and fully included in the federal budget for this year and for the planned period of 2023–2024.
Essentially, the regional officials currently have all the necessary authority, equipment and funding to prevent wildfires. Clearly, it is a complicated issue as force of nature is force of nature. But today I would like to hear from you: are you making use of the funds that were allocated? And what is preventing you today from promptly responding to new fires?
I would like to stress once again: all the proposals from the constituent entities have been supported and money allocated. Tell me if this is not the case but as I understand it, the federal centre has created all the conditions for you to reduce the area of active fires multiple times and ensure that they are eliminated quickly and effectively. It is the responsibility of the regions to achieve that.
Again, it is the heads of regions who are in charge of ensuring that fires are extinguished. When the situation gets out of control, you must not keep it to yourself. This is why this board is meeting today, to speak openly. You are to request assistance as promptly as possible.
Senior officials of the federal government bodies and specifically the Emergencies Ministry must note that a well-coordinated wildfire response system must be built and operate, while involving additional funding, equipment and workforce must not be just a formality. If there is a real threat of a fire spreading, help must arrive – for the respective region or municipality – immediately and not just formally. It is important to assess the real threat, potential risks and to use the forces and means where they are most needed – and, I should stress, regardless of the subordination of a specific territory or land.
At this point, I would like to hear detailed reports from the heads of Yakutia, the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Irkutsk Region, which had the biggest wildfires last year, on how the decisions on this issue have been implemented, how the allocated funds were used and how it affected the territories’ preparedness for the risks in this year’s fire season. And I would like to know how the number of wildfires can be reduced this year and in the future, given the resources and capabilities provided.
I would also like the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment to comment on the reports by the heads of the constituent entities of the Federation and to report on the systemic steps to drastically change the situation.
I would also like to add that I think it is necessary to set a benchmark to assess both the efficiency of this effort and a specific result, that is, a decrease in the wildfire-affected areas of each constituent entity of the Federation and in the country in general.
I suggest we include this indicator in the presidential executive order to be drafted following today’s meeting. Let’s think about, of course, what other items the executive order should include to be more effective. Let me stress that this document is to objectively assess the efficiency of the steps taken to protect our forests from fires as well as the efforts of the regions of the Federation and the Government in this area.
An extremely important issue is rebuilding residential structures. I talked to some colleagues today – tentatively, some 700 buildings that had been used by people as permanent residence and that were destroyed by fire, need to be rebuilt. I am not talking about dachas, that is a separate subject.
Let’s get to work. Head of the Emergencies Ministry Alexander Chupriyan has the floor.
Go ahead please, Mr Chupriyan.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: This is what I would like to say in conclusion. There are several aspects, traditional ones, but we have been improving the results from year to year. I hope this will eventually bring a positive outcome, despite climate change.
What I would like to emphasise is, first of all, the restoration of housing.
(Addressing Marat Khusnullin) Mr Khusnullin, I would like to ask you to join in these efforts, if the assistance of the federal government becomes necessary. Of course, this issue should be addressed above all at the regional level with support from municipalities. But if federal assistance is necessary, I would like to ask Russia’s construction sector to contribute and to respond accordingly.
The second issue concerns payments. This is very important, especially for those who have lost everything, who have lost their personal belongings and their properties, who have become homeless. We must organise these payments, and this must be done quickly, without undue administrative red tape, especially since many people have lost their documents as well, as we all know.
The next issue has to do with children. We must do all we can to help organise summer holidays for the children in the families which have been affected by these fires, at the regional, and if necessary, federal levels – I am addressing this to Ms Golikova.
Next, the relevant commission must start working now. One of the main tasks is to address the evaluation of one square metre of housing realistically, because prices differ from region to region, and we must take this into account to determine the necessary funding.
Incidentally, some of our regional colleagues, as we have learned now, do not need federal assistance in this matter, despite the large amount of housing which they are repairing or will need to rebuild, as our regional colleagues have indicated in their reports. Some of them said they are managing on their own, while others said they need our assistance. This matter must be clarified as soon as possible.
As for consumer loans, of course, we should consider what can be done, and how much funding can be allocated to help the people in terms of their mortgages and other loans.
A relevant Presidential executive order must be prepared to ensure so that we do not forget about this issue and so that proposals are made on amending the regulatory framework.
(Addressing Viktoria Abramchenko) Ms Abramchenko, I would like to ask you, together with the Presidential Executive Office, to prepare a draft executive order without any delay and to submit it to me for signature.
Thank you, and all the best.
