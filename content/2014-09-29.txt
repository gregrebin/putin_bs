President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends and colleagues, it is a great pleasure to welcome you all to the Fourth Caspian Summit.
The Caspian Sea and its resources are a historic heritage belonging to all our countries, and we are collectively responsible for looking after it and developing it for future generations. The Caspian region could be called an oasis of peace and true good-neighbourliness. The foundation of this stability is the thoughtful and carefully weighed approach that our countries, peoples and governments take with regard to everything concerning the Caspian, be it security, economic or environmental protection issues. 
We worked out the organisational side of these policies at our earlier meetings and discussed various mechanisms, including steps to improve the ‘Caspian Five’ forum. This will not only make our summits more effective, but will also activate the work of our ministries and agencies, expert groups, business communities and youth organisations. This will make it possible for us to discuss all issues and find compromise solutions to even the most complex problems. 
Colleagues, in accordance with the agreements we reached at our last meeting in November 2010 in Baku, the experts have carried out a lot of work to prepare the documents that we will examine at this summit.
Today, we will discuss the results of our efforts, outline priorities for the coming future and the longer term, and adopt a political declaration that sets out the principles for multilateral cooperation in the Caspian. These principles will form the cornerstone of our future basic agreement – the convention on the Caspian Sea’s legal status. 
I am sure that our five countries’ continued effort to develop cooperation will strengthen regional stability, make the fight against terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking and other threats and challenges more effective, and will give an added impulse to our countries’ economic development and make them more competitive on global markets. 
Colleagues, we have a busy agenda for this summit. Apart from the Caspian’s legal status, security and economic matters, we will also discuss cooperation in the transport sector, protecting the Caspian Sea’s ecosystem, and will exchange views on current international issues. The most important thing is that we all share the determination to reach mutually acceptable agreements that will facilitate even closer cooperation between our five countries. 
Once again, I wish you a warm welcome to Russia, to Astrakhan, and I am sure that our work will be interesting and useful.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, colleagues,
I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the Caspian Five in this restricted format to discuss our bilateral relations. Russia and Turkmenistan have been bound by relations of friendship and cooperation over the course of many years and in a wide range of areas.
I want to thank you for your significant contributions to the results of the Caspian Summit. I know that your colleagues, with your direct personal participation, made a serious input into preparing the final documents. Thank you very much.
I hope to see you in Russia, in Moscow or any part of the Russian Federation, at a time that is convenient for you. I hope that we will agree on this today as well.
President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov
: Thank you, Mr President, for this opportunity to meet on the sidelines of the summit of Caspian states.
Indeed, we had a very good summit today and good agreements were signed which, I think, will benefit our states and peoples. I think we should continue at this same rate because, as you know, the current global geopolitical situation can change very quickly, and the Caspian Sea is becoming a kind of epicentre, particularly in the Eurasian space.
We have very good reserves that we could use based on the results of today’s meetings and in accordance with the signed documents.
If we are to talk about our bilateral issues, I can say with confidence that they have always been, are and will be developing upward.
Our trade and economic situation is developing well – its growth trends are good. Our humanitarian sector is working well too, with issues of education, science and especially applied research progressing well.
Our cultural ties are developing very nicely as well; we have many new initiatives to discuss: the Turkmen-Russian schools the Pushkin Turkmen-Russian Theatre, and there are many similar examples. What’s most important is that our interstate commission, which is coordinating everything, is furthering all of this.
So please allow me to once again thank you for today’s meeting, to wish you all the best and success in your government work. And all my best wishes to the great nation of Russia. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
Please allow me to once again welcome you to Astrakhan, Russia. We worked very productively within the framework of the Caspian Summit, achieving good results, thanks in part to your delegation’s position and your personal stand.
I am very glad that we have the opportunity to hold a bilateral meeting; we met fairly recently, but the volume of our business ties ensures that each of our meetings is quite substantive.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President, for your warm welcome, as well as the effort that has gone into successfully holding the Fourth Caspian Summit.
In essence, the agreement reached today is the result of intensive efforts from your side and your colleagues. The atmosphere we had at the summit was very positive. It demonstrated that all the nations strive to develop cooperation.
I am very pleased that during the past year, I had the opportunity to meet with you four times and discuss issues of interest to our nations. However, what’s important is not the number of meetings but the progress we have achieved in our relations.
For us, our relations with our important neighbour had special significance, and this significance is increasing today. This is due to bilateral developments, as well as the sensitive situation in the region.
