With President of France Francois Hollande.
Current matters in bilateral relations, cooperation between Russia and the European Union, and implementation of the Minsk Agreements on Ukraine were the subjects of discussion.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, we are here to commemorate a sorrowful moment, but it makes me happy that we have this chance to meet on the sidelines of these events and discuss our bilateral relations and the development of Russia’s ties with the European Union in general.
Sadly, our relations are not in the best state. Trade has decreased, including with France, and this can only be to our regret. I believe that we should look for ways to restore our relations and I think that we all have an interest in seeing this happen.
Of course, we will discuss too the implementation of the Minsk Agreements concerning the situation in southeast of Ukraine. I know that you did a lot to help bring about these agreements, and continue to give this matter your close personal attention.
President of France Francois Hollande
(retranslated): Mr President, despite the tragic circumstances that have brought us together, I am also very pleased to have this chance to meet with you and discuss our relations.
We will of course discuss relations between Russia and the European Union, which, you are right to say, have worsened of late. This is a result of the Ukraine crisis.
I think that we have shown that we are not willing to resign ourselves to this situation, neither with regards to the Ukraine crisis, nor with regards to Russia’s relations with the European Union and France in particular.
Of course, to find the best way out of this situation, we need to make progress in implementing the Minsk Agreements. We both sought these agreements, worked on them, and are doing all we can to see them implemented in practice. I think we will discuss now this work’s continuation through the working groups.
We have several other issues that we could discuss, given that both Russia and France have an important part to play in a number of complicated international issues such as Syria, Iran, Iraq and Libya. We are all working on these issues and so it is important to have this meeting here in Yerevan.

President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan
: Mr Putin, let me thank you once more from all my heart for being with us today. I particularly want to thank you for the words you expressed in your message of two days ago, words that touched the heart of every Armenian. These words, as I see them and our people see them, are the words of the leader of a country that is our ally and brother.
You said in your remarks today that 100 years ago, Russia, together with the governments of France and Britain, recognised and declared that the Ottoman government’s actions against the Armenian people are a crime against humanity, a crime that should be punished. This shows how consistent Russia has been in its policy.
I am therefore very happy that you have come and I thank you very much for this. Once again, I wish you welcome to Armenia.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sargsyan, thank you very much, and thank you very much for the invitation.
I want to note once again the particular nature of relations between Armenia and Russia and between the Armenian and Russian peoples and the other peoples of the Russian Federation. These relations have deep historical roots. We have always been very close allies and will remain so in the future.
Our countries are developing these ties today. I will not talk about politics now, but it goes without saying that we support each other on the international stage. Our foreign ministries work in very close cooperation and we are developing our contacts within integration organisations, and in this respect, I am very pleased that Armenia has joined the Eurasian Economic Union.
Our economic relations are also on a positive track. Our bilateral trade increased despite the difficulties we faced last year, and it is important now to continue this growth. Russian investment in Armenia is increasing, and it now accounts for 40 percent of all foreign investment in Armenia.
I am very happy to be here with you today and to have this opportunity to discuss all areas of our cooperation. Thank you for the invitation.

Memorial ceremony for victims of the Armenian genocide at the Tsitsernakaberd Memorial Complex.
Before the ceremony, Mr Putin laid flowers at the memorial and visited the Tsitsernakaberd Memorial Museum.
The Tsitsernakaberd memorial symbolises mourning for the 1.5 million Armenians who died during the tragic events of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire. The memorial complex was built in 1967 and comprises the Hall of Memory, The Reborn Armenia Memorial Column, and the Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute.

Speech at memorial ceremony for victims of the Armenian genocide
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, ladies and gentlemen,
I am grateful to President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan for the invitation to take part in today’s memorial events.
We have sincere sympathy for the Armenian people, who went through one of the greatest tragedies in human history. More than 1.5 million peaceful people were killed and injured, and more than 600,000 were driven from their homes and suffered mass repression. Numerous priceless architectural monuments and sacred objects were destroyed and ancient books and invaluable manuscripts were burned.
The events of 1915 shook the entire world. Russia felt these events as its own grief. Hundreds of thousands, even millions of defenceless and homeless Armenians found shelter in the Russian Empire and were saved.
It was Russia’s diplomatic efforts that secured international condemnation of the violence inflicted on the Armenian people. At the initiative of Sergei Sazonov, Russia’s foreign minister, Russia, France and Britain, as the French President recalled just now, made a joint statement in which they directly called these events a crime against humanity and civilisation.
Relations between the fraternal peoples of Russia and Armenia have always been characterised by particular spiritual closeness and mutual support. This was the case during the dramatic events of a century ago, during the Great Patriotic War, and during the devastating Spitak earthquake.
Today too, we share the Armenian people’s sorrow.
Friends, I want to emphasise that hundreds of cities around Russia are holding more than 2,000 memorial events today. Not only members of the large Armenian community in Russia, which counts around three million people, are taking part, but so are tens of thousands of people of other ethnic backgrounds.
Russia remains resolute in what has always been its consistent view that there is and cannot be any justification for mass murder of any people.
Russia has signed and initiated a number of international legal acts that lay the foundations for modern international criminal law, including the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
The international community must do everything possible to ensure that these tragic events never happen again, so that all peoples can live in peace and harmony and not have to know the horrors that arise from religious enmity, aggressive nationalism, and xenophobia.
Sadly, we see that neo-fascism is once again rearing its head in many parts of the world, radical nationalists are seeking power, and anti-Semitism is on the rise. We also see signs of Russophobia. We need to ask ourselves why this is happening and what is the cause? In all of our actions in critically important parts of the world, we must think first of all about what will happen next, think about the consequences.
At the same time, as we remember the tragic events of past years, we should also look to the future with optimism, believe in the ideals of friendship, good-neighbourliness, and solidarity, learn goodness and harmony and learn to respect each other and respect each other’s interests. This is the only way to make the world a better, more stable and safer place.
Friends, we are with you. Thank you for your attention.
