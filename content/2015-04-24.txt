President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, we are here to commemorate a sorrowful moment, but it makes me happy that we have this chance to meet on the sidelines of these events and discuss our bilateral relations and the development of Russia’s ties with the European Union in general.
Sadly, our relations are not in the best state. Trade has decreased, including with France, and this can only be to our regret. I believe that we should look for ways to restore our relations and I think that we all have an interest in seeing this happen.
Of course, we will discuss too the implementation of the Minsk Agreements concerning the situation in southeast of Ukraine. I know that you did a lot to help bring about these agreements, and continue to give this matter your close personal attention.
President of France Francois Hollande
(retranslated): Mr President, despite the tragic circumstances that have brought us together, I am also very pleased to have this chance to meet with you and discuss our relations.
We will of course discuss relations between Russia and the European Union, which, you are right to say, have worsened of late. This is a result of the Ukraine crisis.
I think that we have shown that we are not willing to resign ourselves to this situation, neither with regards to the Ukraine crisis, nor with regards to Russia’s relations with the European Union and France in particular.
Of course, to find the best way out of this situation, we need to make progress in implementing the Minsk Agreements. We both sought these agreements, worked on them, and are doing all we can to see them implemented in practice. I think we will discuss now this work’s continuation through the working groups.
We have several other issues that we could discuss, given that both Russia and France have an important part to play in a number of complicated international issues such as Syria, Iran, Iraq and Libya. We are all working on these issues and so it is important to have this meeting here in Yerevan.

President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan
: Mr Putin, let me thank you once more from all my heart for being with us today. I particularly want to thank you for the words you expressed in your message of two days ago, words that touched the heart of every Armenian. These words, as I see them and our people see them, are the words of the leader of a country that is our ally and brother.
You said in your remarks today that 100 years ago, Russia, together with the governments of France and Britain, recognised and declared that the Ottoman government’s actions against the Armenian people are a crime against humanity, a crime that should be punished. This shows how consistent Russia has been in its policy.
I am therefore very happy that you have come and I thank you very much for this. Once again, I wish you welcome to Armenia.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sargsyan, thank you very much, and thank you very much for the invitation.
I want to note once again the particular nature of relations between Armenia and Russia and between the Armenian and Russian peoples and the other peoples of the Russian Federation. These relations have deep historical roots. We have always been very close allies and will remain so in the future.
Our countries are developing these ties today. I will not talk about politics now, but it goes without saying that we support each other on the international stage. Our foreign ministries work in very close cooperation and we are developing our contacts within integration organisations, and in this respect, I am very pleased that Armenia has joined the Eurasian Economic Union.
Our economic relations are also on a positive track. Our bilateral trade increased despite the difficulties we faced last year, and it is important now to continue this growth. Russian investment in Armenia is increasing, and it now accounts for 40 percent of all foreign investment in Armenia.
I am very happy to be here with you today and to have this opportunity to discuss all areas of our cooperation. Thank you for the invitation.
