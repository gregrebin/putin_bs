Meeting with elected regional governors.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
To begin with, I would like to congratulate you on your election to high positions in the regions, the residents of which have entrusted you with these positions that are very important for every person because the closer to the people the more responsible and complicated it is. I think some of you already know this while others will learn this soon.
The election campaign follows its own logic. The main goal is to show the voters one’s intentions, to demonstrate to them what you want to achieve. But this approach also dictates tough criticism of the opponents. This is all clear but it is also obvious that after the end of this period it is necessary to show tenability and keep the promises that you made to the people This is the bottom line.
All of you have different life and administrative experience. Some of you, like Oleg Kozhemyako, started careers as a plumber, doctor or lawyer. However, now you must use everything you have, the experience you have accumulated in the years of your work and life, that is the experience of life, production and public activity, and what is very important – to work befittingly for the benefit of people, laying aside other interests and priorities.
I would like to wish you success and the attainment of the goals that you set during the election campaign. I would like to hope that you will not let down the people and that they did not go wrong in choosing you.
The election campaign was complicated and even conflict-prone in the majority of your regions. Well, this is the logic of political struggle. In reality, I am glad that representatives of opposition parties, and this is the case for the majority here, do well at the elections and reach the goals they set for themselves.
Recently I met with the leaders of all the parliamentary parties, the leaders in the Russian Parliament, and we discussed this as well. They, in turn, also promised to give you every support. I hope you get to feel this support from the state, from me and from the members of your own parties.
And I would like to wish you good luck and a happy New Year. Let us discuss what issues and problems we have.

Vladimir Putin congratulated current and former workers of the Ministry of Civil Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disaster Relief of the Russian Federation on their professional holiday, Rescuers’ Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, veterans,
Congratulations on your professional holiday, Rescuer’s Day. Thank you for your efficient and selfless service. Emergencies Ministry divisions are always ready to act in an urgent and resolute manner, in highly risky conditions and in the most complicated and atypical circumstances.
You proved your ability to successfully work as a well-coordinated team many times, both in our country and abroad, during most complicated rescue and humanitarian operations following natural disasters, industrial accidents, fires and other emergencies.
I would like to note the particular importance and significance of further improving prevention programmes. The Emergencies Ministry should be more proactive in preventing emergencies, ensuring the strictest and principled control over fire safety rules, other requirements and safety procedures at complex technical facilities and in public places.
Of course, real life will always throw in unexpected events. And it is you that people in distress rely on because they are certain that help will always come and Emergencies Ministry rescuers will do everything possible and impossible to save the most important thing: human lives.
We will continue to further reinforce the ministry’s unique personnel potential, pay close attention to the quality and diversified training and technical equipment of Russian rescuers, as well as social support to the personnel and their families.
We will certainly also pay the utmost attention to educating the younger generation in the glorious traditions of courage and honour, which is the pride of the Emergencies Ministry and the entire country.
I wish you good health, good luck and success in your demanding and noble service. And of course, I wish you and your families a happy New Year.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
We are holding our traditional, pre-New Year or pre-holiday meeting in an unusual format. Here, within the walls of this theatre, I would like to thank the Bolshoi Theatre for its hospitality and its company for the wonderful gift they have prepared for us.
The magical ballet The Nutcracker, the fairy tale feeling that will reign supreme on stage, has long been one of the brightest symbols of the holiday season beginning in December, and the New Year and Christmas. There is no doubt that the joyful, airy feeling of this event, the wonderful music by Pyotr Tchaikovsky and the brilliant performance by the artists, which we will now see on stage, will leave everyone with the most pleasant and warm impressions.
Of course, bidding farewell to another year, the year 2018, we review the results and look to the future, making new plans for the future as usual. The outgoing year was unique and different for every person, but it united our society and our citizens in events that were important for all of Russia. I am referring to the domestic political calendar, major domestic political events and, certainly, the implementation of major, landmark projects such as the Crimean Bridge and the World Cup that we conducted brilliantly. In general, we worked together for the consolidation and prosperity of our homeland.
I would like to express special gratitude to all those who took an active part in the Year of the Volunteer: today we held a conference at the Kremlin with our regional colleagues on this occasion along with representatives of the volunteer movement and socially-oriented non-governmental organisations. And I would like to address special words of gratitude to this particular category of our citizens who are wholeheartedly helping others through charity, and who carry out and support educational and creative projects. Needless to say, we will continue this work even though the Year of the Volunteer is coming to a close.
I would like to express gratitude to our army personnel, soldiers and officers for their valour and courage, and professional actions both in Russia and during various events, exercises and the implementation of combat assignments, including missions abroad. I would like to thank our colleagues in federal, regional and municipal government bodies for their effective work to raise the quality of life and the living standards of our citizens.
Contributions to the development of this large, multi-ethnic country were made by scientists and doctors, teachers and entrepreneurs, representatives of public organisations and artists, all citizens of our Fatherland. The main point is that we are ready to move forward with confidence, to respond to any challenge, to resolve even the most complicated tasks, to make breakthroughs and to achieve success for the benefit of the homeland, for the benefit of Russia and its people. I am sure that we will act in the same vein in the future.
I wish all of you health, love, happiness, peace and prosperity of our great homeland.
Happy holidays to you, and a happy upcoming 2019.
