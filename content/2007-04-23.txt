Vladimir Putin`s Address on the Occasion of Boris Yeltsin’s Passing
April 23, 2007

Moscow
Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin, the first President of Russia, has passed away. His presidency has inscribed him forever in Russian and in world history.
A person who began a new era has passed away. A new democratic Russia was born during his time: a free, open and peaceful country. A state in which the power truly does belong to the people.
The first President of Russia’s strength consisted in the mass support of Russian citizens for his ideas and aspirations. Thanks to the will and direct initiative of President Boris Yeltsin a new constitution, one which declared human rights a supreme value, was adopted. It gave people the opportunity to freely express their thoughts, to freely choose power in Russia, to realise their creative and entrepreneurial plans. This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation.
We knew Boris Nikolayevich as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader. And he was always very honest and frank while defending his position.
Boris Yeltsin assumed full responsibility for everything he called for, for everything he aspired to. For everything he tried to do and did do for the sake of Russia, for the sake of millions of Russians. And he invariably took upon himself, let it in his heart, all the trials and tribulations of Russia, peoples’ difficulties and problems.
And today I would like to express my most sincere and profound condolences to Naina Iosifovna and to Boris Nikolayevich’s friends and relatives.
We grieve with you. We will do everything to ensure that the memory of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, his noble thoughts and his words “take care of Russia” will always act as our moral and political watchwords.
I declare 25 April 2007 a day of national mourning.

Beginning of Meeting with U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates
April 23, 2007
20:58
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Mr Defence Secretary, colleagues,
It is a great pleasure for us to welcome you to Moscow. I am very pleased that you have accepted the invitation I made in Munich, and I am also very happy that President Bush has reacted so speedily and sent you to Moscow.
By the way, I am to speak with him on the telephone after our meeting today. I will be able to pass on to him the best wishes from his defence secretary in Moscow. I am very pleased that such a busy political season is opening now in Russian-U.S. relations.
[U.S. Secretary of State] Ms Rice will be visiting Moscow soon. Then I will be meeting with the U.S. President at the G8 summit in Germany. We also have other meetings planned, including within the Russia-NATO Council. I know too, that you have a very busy schedule here in Moscow.
We are very happy to see you. Welcome!
U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates: Thank you, Mr President, for your invitation to come to Moscow.
I spoke with President Bush yesterday before flying out from the United States. He asked me to pass on to you his best wishes. When I left, I did not know that you would have the chance to inform so swiftly on how my visit here is going.
It has been almost fifteen years since I was last in Moscow. The changes that have taken place have made a huge impression on me.
Russian-U.S. relations are very important. I think that the upcoming meetings that await us demonstrate this importance and the need to develop our relations on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Together we can achieve much indeed.
