Russian-Turkish talks in a restricted format. With President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you. Thank you for accepting our invitation.
The situation in the region is very acute; all of us can see and understand this. I believe that our meeting today and our consultations are quite needed.
I would like to express my hope that the level of Russian-Turkish relations that has been reached over the recent period will play a role of its own in settling all complicated issues that have taken shape in the region today and will make it possible to find answers to all, even very difficult, questions in the interests of both Turkey and Russia, as well as in the interests of all countries in the region.
Welcome.
President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan
(retranslated): Thank you, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation. I think this invitation will be of use precisely in the period when a very difficult situation is emerging in our region.
We certainly have been in contact before this and maintained close liaison. Thus, we will be able to preserve relations of partnership between our delegations during our talks and compare notes.
Today’s meeting will enable us to discuss this situation in more detail and this undoubtedly will make it possible to ensure peace. The operation titled Peace Spring will usher in a new reality.
I would like to express my gratitude once again. Thank you very much.
