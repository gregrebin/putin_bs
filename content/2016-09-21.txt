President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Welcome.
I know that you are now going through hard times and would not like to take part in any official meetings or conversations. Please forgive me for inviting you here at such a difficult moment but I wanted very much to shake your hand and thank you for your son.
He was a real hero, which is why yesterday I signed an executive order awarding him the Star of the Hero of the Russian Federation. He is a hero because far from every person remains committed to his oath and duty and to his people, to the point of risking his life in the face of gunfire.
Only cowards can shoot an unarmed person, only cowards. And only real heroes, real men like the son you brought up, can look death in the eyes without fear. This is an example for many of us. And his words “Do your duty, brothers” is an order to all his fellow officers.
I am deeply indebted to you. I recall how Dagestani militiamen fought against terrorism when they faced this threat. He is a hero of that order. I know that no words can alleviate your grief, of course. However, I want you to know that the people of Moscow and Russia, all people who have a heart, a conscience and any sense at all, understand very well what happened. All of us, and you should know this.
Again, I am deeply indebted to you, and I thank you so much for your son.
