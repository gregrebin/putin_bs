President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
The issue we are to discuss today is of extreme importance. As a rule, we consider it only when a tragedy occurs, but we agreed earlier that we would work on it on a regular basis. I am talking about additional measures to improve crime prevention at educational institutions in the Russian Federation.
The speaker is the Interior Minister. Please, Mr Kolokoltsev.
