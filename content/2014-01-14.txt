Meeting with Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, good afternoon. We are happy to welcome you in Moscow.
I am happy that our contacts are regular and business-like; they are developing in all areas, including the economy, inter-parliamentary and political contacts. Our Foreign Minister [Sergei Lavrov
] visited your country in May.
It is a very positive development that for your visit, Mr Prime Minister, our colleagues have prepared a number of important documents for us to sign, which will be a new serious step forward in our relations.
I am happy to welcome you in Moscow!
Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban (translated from Russian): First, allow me to thank you, Mr President, for your invitation. I had a similar opportunity a year ago. 
Russia is a very important partner for Hungary. I would say that our economic partnership is of a strategic nature.
Besides, Russia is Hungary’s most important trade and economic partner outside the European Union. We highly value the progress that has been made under your leadership. This cooperation is very important for Hungary.
A year ago, we agreed to enhance our economic cooperation, and we did it. I believe our progress in trade was beyond any comparison. I would like to thank you for this.
I hope the documents you mentioned will become another step in this direction.
