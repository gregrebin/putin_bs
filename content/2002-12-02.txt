Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
My Russian colleagues and I appreciate the invitation by Chairman of the PRC Jiang Zemin to visit Beijing again. I would like to thank our Chinese friends for the very warm welcome accorded to the Russian delegation.
The talks today have been very substantive and fruitful.
The situation in our countries and in the world is developing dynamically and we must take the ongoing changes into account. We have reviewed the development of bilateral ties over the past years and we have gone on record as saying that they have achieved a new level of quality. We have not only overcome our differences, but have become truly strategic partners and have outlined the prospects for the development of our relations.
Such an approach fully meets the spirit of the Russian-Chinese Treaty on Neighbourly Relations, Friendship and Cooperation signed a year ago.
Today we discussed the practical aspects of the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership and exchanged opinions on key international political issues.
We discussed the mechanisms of ensuring global and regional stability with particular attention to the interaction between Russia and China in the fight against international terrorism.
We discussed the work of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We believe that an enhanced role of the SCO in ensuring security and deepening economic integration in Eurasia is in the interests of not only the participating countries but of the whole of this vast region.
Our positions on these and other items on the agenda are set forth in the joint declaration “Russia and China in the Modern World” which we have just signed.
During the meeting we discussed in detail the whole range of bilateral ties, and one of the priorities is the consistent development of trade and economic cooperation. The priorities in this area are energy and increasing the share of hi-tech products in trade.
The economic agenda of the two countries includes the introduction of new forms of cooperation, especially investment and production cooperation.
Now that economic cooperation between Russia and China is actively developing and entering a new stage, the stage of implementing major joint projects, the constant and prompt exchange of accurate information is necessary.
In connection with this, I would like to note that we attach great significance to the Interfax-China project being implemented in the People’s Republic of China by one of the most well-known independent Russian news agencies.
I am convinced that new opportunities are opening up in the humanitarian sphere. We have extensive positive experience in this field, notably within the framework of the non-governmental Russian-Chinese Committee for Peace, Friendship and Development.
The 16th Congress of the Communist Party of China recently ended. It was a milestone in the life of our neighbour which laid down ambitious plans for national development. We sincerely wish our Chinese partners success in implementing these plans.
I am absolutely convinced that the development of our partnership and the continuation of its best traditions will continue to serve the interests of the peoples of Russia and China in the new century.
Thank you.
Question (ITAR-TASS): What in your opinion is the place of Russia and China in the world that is taking shape after the end of the Cold War?
Vladimir Putin: As you know, Russia and China support the formation of a multi-polar world; the development of democratic principles in the new structure of international relations; a stronger legal framework of international cooperation and the main institutions of international cooperation, central of which is the United Nations.
International relations should be stable, predictable and should ensure progress in solving the tasks the states set themselves in the world. We are absolutely convinced that a special strategic relationship between Russia and China will meet all these tasks and will help not only to solve the problems facing Russia and China, but will create a situation of stability in the world.
