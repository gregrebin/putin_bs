President Vladimir Putin:
Dear friends!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
The opening of the 8th International Aviation and Space Salon, a Salon that Russia has organised for 15 years, is a very significant event for our country.
It is more than just an exhibition and a world class air show. MAKS has become the most important celebration of aviation in our country. This event continues the long-standing tradition of aviation parades and air show holidays that has always existed in Russia.
People of all different ages are going to come to the Zhukovsky Air Base near Moscow for the exhibition. But it is mainly young people that gather here. And this suggests that the romance of flying, the interest in aviation and in space exploration, remains attractive and essential.
We are proud of the fact that over quite a short period of time MAKS has done more than simply assume a distinguished position among international air salons. It has confirmed its role as a world leader in this sphere. I believe that all the participants and guests of the Salon will be able to confirm their sense of just how much the Salon’s possibilities have increased in recent times.
This year the number of exhibiters has increased by 30 percent. More than 780 domestic and foreign companies and institutions are present here. MAKS welcomes official delegations from over 110 countries.
We are pleased to see that the number of international participants is consistently increasing. We are going to continue to develop the Salon as a forum for concluding contracts and developing international cooperation in aviation and space.
MAKS-2007 has adopted a new philosophy with regards to organising such events. And I am not merely referring to developing the Salon’s infrastructure and making it operate in a more systematic way. As you can see, large modern comfortable booths have been built, the necessary information infrastructure and communications link-ups have been set up. But the most important thing is the events scheduled during the Aviation Salon: academic conferences, meetings between experts, seminars. One of the most important novelties of this Russian exhibition is that academics, designers and engineers are actively participating in the Salon and in the discussion of the future development of aviation and space exploration.
Virtually all leading developers and producers of aviation and space technology have representatives at the Air Salon. And along with this I would like to point out the transformational character of the exhibition hosted by the Russian Associated Aviation Construction Corporation. It plans to compete more actively in the international market with competitive passenger and cargo aircraft. Russia faces the additional challenge of preserving its leading role as a producer of military combat aircraft technology. Our country’s unique potential in the space sector is visible at the Salon. Along with this I would like to emphasize that Russia, a country that today is benefiting from increased economic possibilities, will continue to pay the closest possible attention to the high-tech sector and its development.
And I certainly cannot help but mention one of MAKS best traditions, namely the full programme of air shows which highlight the skills of the best pilots in the world. The World Cup flying competition will also take place here. I wish all participants the opportunity to show off their skills. I am confident that our audience will welcome all the participants with delight and respect. But it is obvious that since this event is being held here, in Russia, the audience will pay special attention to the Russian participants.
Dear ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate you on the opening of our international Salon, which promises to be the biggest forum of the business partnership in aviation and space. I wish you success!
Thank you for your attention.
