President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Go ahead.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev
: Mr President, under Article 112 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister is required to present the composition of the Government of the Russian Federation to the President within one week. Fulfilling this obligation, I would like to submit the relevant executive order for your consideration.
This is what the suggested structure consists of.
First, considering that the current Government has proven effective, there are no major changes in the suggested new structure.

Executive Order On the Structure of Federal Executive Bodies of Power
May 15, 2018
However, there are a number of important proposals aimed at streamlining the current system of executive government bodies. I am referring to dividing the Ministry of Education and Science into two separate bodies to deal with education issues in the country, notably the Ministry of Education that will be in charge of general education, that is, school and special vocational education, and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education that will be responsible for the activities of research institutions and the development of science in the country as a whole, and, consequently the performance of universities and other higher educational institutions.
This will allow us to make better use of our potential in the development of both education systems. With this change, the Federal Agency for Scientific Organisations that dealt with the Academy of Sciences will become part of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. This is one of the suggested changes.
In this case, an agency for oversight over education will be a separate body monitoring national education. It will be under the Government, performing supervisory functions over both secondary schools, higher schools and science.
One more important change submitted for consideration is the transformation of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media into the Ministry of Digital Development with a view to implementing the digital agenda, on which the whole world is working and which is absolutely urgent in this country, as you, Mr President, mentioned both in your Address to the Federal Assembly and the Executive Order of May 7 of this year.
Another important idea is to transfer trade missions that are now part of the Ministry of Economic Development to the Ministry of Industry. This will allows us to concentrate on supporting exports of our industrial enterprises and technology exports – the issues that the Ministry of Industry is dealing with today anyway. This would be a good merger of their capabilities within the country, while providing trade representation outside it. This is yet another structural change that is being suggested.
The number of deputy prime ministers and some issues linked with staff size and other technological issues of the new Government’s activities have been tailored to what you and I discussed.
Vladimir Putin: All right, agreed. I will sign this executive order today.
Mr Medvedev, when will you be ready to make proposals on staffing?
Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President, I will be ready to visit you on Friday and make proposals on staffing.
Vladimir Putin: All right.
Dmitry Medvedev: It is settled.
