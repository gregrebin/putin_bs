President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, gentlemen,
I would like to sincerely welcome our guests and friends, and to thank you for taking the decision to come to Russia to take part in the 3rd World Military Winter Games.
This is a remarkable event, as it enhances trust in such a paramount area as military cooperation.
It is very important that people in your profession should see each other not through the aiming sight of military and combat equipment, but at sports venues, thus strengthening the friendship between one another.
I hope you will enjoy your time in Russia in general, and in Sochi, a city where we have created a wonderful sports infrastructure. We shall do everything we can for you to feel at home, to feel comfortable, and I assure you that we will create excellent conditions for all the competitors to reveal their best qualities.
Allow me to wish good luck to you and to all the participants in the competitions. Welcome!
And, as you know, today is a holiday in our country, Defender of the Fatherland Day. This is a day when we acknowledge the achievements of our Armed Forces, Army and Navy. Now, as you might know, we are holding an event here in the Kremlin which will be followed by a concert. Let me also send my best wishes to the personnel of your armed forces, the armies of the countries you represent.
Thank you.
International Military Sports Council President, Colonel Abdul Hakeem Al Shino (Bahrain): Your Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation,
As the President of CISM, an organisation representing 136 countries of the world, I would like to express our appreciation and thanks to your great country and to you personally for hosting the 3rd CISM World Winter Games.
It is my tremendous privilege to be here today, Mr President, to present very great countries with me here from around the world, and to say thanks to you personally and to appreciate your great efforts to host this CISM event in the city of Sochi.
Mr President, it is my pleasure, I am very happy to say that the military athletes of the Russian Federation represent their country very well, giving a very great example to the military athletes around the world.Events

Vladimir Putin attended a gala concert marking Defender of the Fatherland Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, friends,
I want to congratulate you and all military service members and civilian personnel of the country on the Defender of the Fatherland Day.
This holiday has long since acquired the high status of a national holiday. Such a sincere and heartfelt attitude towards military service is based on an understanding of its significance; honouring the courage of all those who protected and continue to protect our Motherland, its interests, its peaceful, calm life; and, of course, pride: pride in the legendary accomplishments of the Army and the Navy.
We send our most sincere words to the great generation of victors who defeated Nazism. You overcame the harshest, most unthinkable hardships. You showed what the power of love of the Fatherland means, to what heights of courage and bravery this holy feeling lifts a person, you left your descendants an everlasting historic lesson of unity of the people.
Today we honour all the veterans of the Armed Forces, the people who made such a vast contribution to the development of the Army and Navy, to enhancing the glorious traditions of the Russian warrior host, to the education and professional training of new generations of soldiers, sailors and officers.
Our officers are well known to have their own particular military patriotism. They devote their lives to defending their Motherland, and these are their ideals, their honour and their key values. Such a responsible, selfless attitude towards military service is characteristic of the Russian military. And they are rightly considered to be a strong pillar of the state and society.
I would like to thank all the service members who are currently helping the people of Syria in their fight against terrorism, for their bravery and resolve. You display the most noble qualities, saving misfortunate people, providing them with medical aid and delivering hundreds of tonnes of humanitarian cargo.
The names of the heroes, our contemporaries, the deeds of the best Russian soldiers and commanders, have become our common legacy. They should serve as the benchmark for those young people who chose for themselves hard service in the army and in the navy.
Friends,
Russia’s security, the protection of its citizens, is certainly in good hands. Our armed forces have tremendous combat potential, they are in a state of constant readiness, capable of acting accurately and cohesively, and of confidently repelling any aggression.
Recent years have witnessed dramatic changes in the military arena of the country. This is an undeniable reality of our life. And we shall continue to work on strengthening the professional and organisational components of the Armed Forces, on increasing their mobility and combat readiness.
Among the priorities are the enhancement of the strategic nuclear shield and modern aerospace forces, as well as strict execution of the State Armaments Programme. The growing capabilities of the national defence and industrial complex allow us to secure the implementation of our large-scale plans.
Friends,
Once again, I sincerely wish you a happy holiday. I wish for you to steadily reach your goals, and to achieve new success. I also wish for your families to be an unfailing base of love and support. I wish health to you and your loved ones.
Happy holiday!
