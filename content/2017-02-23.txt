President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, gentlemen,
I would like to sincerely welcome our guests and friends, and to thank you for taking the decision to come to Russia to take part in the 3rd World Military Winter Games.
This is a remarkable event, as it enhances trust in such a paramount area as military cooperation.
It is very important that people in your profession should see each other not through the aiming sight of military and combat equipment, but at sports venues, thus strengthening the friendship between one another.
I hope you will enjoy your time in Russia in general, and in Sochi, a city where we have created a wonderful sports infrastructure. We shall do everything we can for you to feel at home, to feel comfortable, and I assure you that we will create excellent conditions for all the competitors to reveal their best qualities.
Allow me to wish good luck to you and to all the participants in the competitions. Welcome!
And, as you know, today is a holiday in our country, Defender of the Fatherland Day. This is a day when we acknowledge the achievements of our Armed Forces, Army and Navy. Now, as you might know, we are holding an event here in the Kremlin which will be followed by a concert. Let me also send my best wishes to the personnel of your armed forces, the armies of the countries you represent.
Thank you.
International Military Sports Council President, Colonel Abdul Hakeem Al Shino (Bahrain): Your Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation,
As the President of CISM, an organisation representing 136 countries of the world, I would like to express our appreciation and thanks to your great country and to you personally for hosting the 3rd CISM World Winter Games.
It is my tremendous privilege to be here today, Mr President, to present very great countries with me here from around the world, and to say thanks to you personally and to appreciate your great efforts to host this CISM event in the city of Sochi.
Mr President, it is my pleasure, I am very happy to say that the military athletes of the Russian Federation represent their country very well, giving a very great example to the military athletes around the world.
