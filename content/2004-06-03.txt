Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister, allow me once again to wish you a warm welcome. I am pleased to meet with you again. There was a definite need for us to meet and hold talks. I am very interested in hearing your views on the developments in Serbia, Montenegro and in the Balkans in general. But before we move on to these subjects, I would like to say how pleased we are to see that no matter what the difficulties, our trade and economic cooperation is developing intensively. Russia holds stable second place among Serbia and Montenegro’s trading partners. Trade between our countries has passed the billion-dollar mark and is on the way to reaching $1.5 billion. As I recall it, Serbia accounts for 85 percent or even more of this trade. Meeting with the Serbian Prime Minister is therefore a priority, I think, in that it gives us the chance to expand our cooperation in all areas, above all, of course, in trade and the economy. Welcome.
Vojislav Kostunica: It was with great pleasure that I accepted your invitation to meet with you here in Sochi. I still remember our last meeting in October 2000, following the democratic changes that took place in our country. Then we had another meeting when you were on your way back from the summit. I will always remember your understanding of the situation in our country. Be the issue the existence of the State Community of Serbia and Montenegro, the very complex Kosovo question or the problem that we both face – the threat of global terrorism – understanding of the situation in our country is very important for us in order to preserve peace and security in our region. I think there are a great many opportunities for us to strengthen and develop our trade and economic ties. As well as our meetings, I will also always remember the letters full of goodwill and friendship that you sent me. Thank you.
