President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Abdulatipov, we have known each other for a long time. I know that you are a patriotic man and that you love both Russia and your native region. You also have a great deal of personal life experience.
You have worked in the federal government agencies, held diplomatic posts, and you know how to work with young people. I am confident that you will use all this experience in your new job. I know that you have a great sense of responsibility toward this line of work, because you truly love Daghestan.
Currently, Daghestan faces some major challenges; the situation is difficult. That said, the previous administration nevertheless succeeded in getting things moving after a standstill. It was able to demonstrate some positive momentum in the economy and the social sector. But there are still more, far more, unresolved problems than recent achievements. So you have some major challenges before you.
The first step, of course, involves the formation of a competent, responsible and effective team that is balance in all respects, including the ethnic side of it, for Daghestan is a complex republic with diverse ethnic composition, and its people include a large variety of ethnic groups. When I talk about an effective team, I am referring to both the people and the economic potential.
”Currently, Daghestan faces some major challenges. The first step involves the formation of a competent, responsible and effective team that is balance in all respects, including the ethnic side of it.“
This is one of the key republics in the North Caucasus, and the people – members of different ethnic groups – need to feel that they are represented in all of the republic’s central government agencies. At the same time, these need to be worthy, professional people.
You face many challenges, including in law enforcement, but I am confident that by relying on your experience and public support, you will be able to achieve a great deal. I wish you success.
What can you say about the first days at your new job?
Acting President of the Republic of Daghestan Ramazan Abdulatipov: First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to you, Mr President, for your trust in me. And my main goal is to justify this trust. My next goal is to regain people’s trust toward the authorities at all levels, including the federal authorities working there and the regional authorities, as well as local government agencies.
We need to significantly change our personnel policy to make it modern. It so happened (I don’t want to blame anyone) that Russia under your leadership has moved toward a market economy, capitalism, democracy, but Daghestan in many ways slipped back into feudalism, and we need to get out of that state, including the manifestations of extremism, as our peoples’ moods and attitude largely depend on this.
Living here in Moscow and working with the federal authorities, I have said many times that the problems do not lie between the ethnic groups – this is a problem stemming from the contradictions between culture and ignorance. And we must overcome ignorance, which has probably penetrated into the local government agencies as well. Indeed, people have a great deal of hope, and I am ready.
To those who tell me, “Weren’t you afraid to take this post, do you really need this at your age?” and such, I always respond, “My homeland does not scare me,” because I am truly a patriot of Daghestan, I serve Daghestan. I am a patriot of Russia and serve Russia. And when somebody starts telling me something, I always say, “I will not allow anyone to state that I, my father, my brothers or my people are any less patriotic than anybody else.” Especially since my father was among the defenders of Sevastopol during the Great Patriotic War.
So it is true that I face major challenges, but these are the tasks that can be fulfilled. Especially since the people of Daghestan are a unique people. They are very enterprising; don’t interfere with their work – help them.
”The people – members of different ethnic groups – need to feel that they are represented in all of the republic’s central government agencies.“
And when I spoke before them and members of government bodies, I stated that the only person who gave the right answer to the “What are you doing?” question was Vladimir Putin who said, “I provide services to people.” That is our goal: not to boss people around, but to provide services to the public.
And I think that with your support, we can move forward in this direction and continue the positive trends that we already see in the Republic of Daghestan.
Vladimir Putin: Daghestan has given a great deal to the nation overall: culturally and in terms of increasing its defence capacity. You know about Daghestan’s defence companies. And it is enough to say that Derbent is the most ancient city on our nation’s territory. It is enough to recall Rasul Gamzatov [People’s Poet of Daghestan, 1923–2003], who was a great patriot of Russia and his own Republic of Daghestan.
I hope that by relying on all the positive things in the republic (and there are a great deal of them), you will be able to overcome all the difficulties faced today by the people of Daghestan, and move forward even faster than it was in recent years.
Ramazan Abdulatipov: Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I wish you success.

Speech at meeting with delegates to the Russian Orthodox Church’s Bishops’ Council
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Holiness, Your Eminences, Your Graces,
Today is the enthronement day of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, and I once again congratulate you, Your Holiness, on this anniversary of your enthronement.
Four years have passed since that moment, and much has taken place in our country’s life and in our religious life, in the Russian Orthodox Church’s life, over this time. I thank you with all my heart for your tireless work and for the care you show the Church, and all of Russia and its people.
It was with great pleasure that I accepted your proposal to continue the tradition of meeting with the delegates to the Russian Orthodox Church’s Bishops’ Council. Thank you for this proposal.
”We want to continue our multifaceted and positive partnership with the Russian Orthodox Church and will do everything we can to help the Church as it rebuilds itself. We will work together to consolidate harmony in our society and strengthen our country’s moral backbone.“
This event is unquestionably the focus of great attention. You will be discussing the key issues in the life of the Church and our society today. Your Holiness, I wish you and everyone taking part in the Bishops’ Council success in your constructive and lofty mission.
The Russian Orthodox Church has always been with the people at every time, sharing with them all joys and sorrows, supporting and inspiring them, and cementing the moral fabric of our public life and indeed of our entire statehood.
Patriotism, faith and strength of spirit have always been at the foundation of Russia’s every victory and achievement. These intrinsic national character traits helped our people to overcome the Time of Troubles in 1612 and gain victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1812, which was as great a victory for our people as was the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War.
Tomorrow, we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad
. During the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War our people and soldiers drew inspiration from the true values that have always helped us to victory.
It was the strength of the true Russia of history, the Russia of Minin and Pozharsky, Dmitry Donskoy and Alexander Nevsky, St Sergius of Radonezh and St Seraphim of Sarov, that defeated Nazism and saved the world.
But we must remember too, the other pages in our history, including the lessons to be learnt from the dramatic events of the early twentieth century. It was in large part the erosion of our spiritual and national foundations and the real persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church and our other traditional faiths that set our unified country on a course of destruction and precipitated it into revolution, upheaval and fratricidal conflict and war.
We want to continue our multifaceted and positive partnership with the Russian Orthodox Church and will do everything we can to help the Church as it rebuilds itself. We will work together to consolidate harmony in our society and strengthen our country’s moral backbone.
Traditional values, believers’ religious feelings, and people’s rights, freedoms, and dignity must all be protected by both the power of public opinion and the power of the law.
There is greater demand than ever today for the state authorities and all of the traditional faiths to work together in cooperation and partnership. We are a secular state of course, and cannot allow state life and church life to merge, but at the same time, we must avoid too, a vulgar and primitive interpretation of what being secular means. 
”The Russian Orthodox Church and our other traditional faiths must have all the possibilities for carrying out full and real service in important areas such as supporting families and mothers, raising and educating children, youth policy, resolving the many social problems we still face, and strengthening patriotic spirit in the Armed Forces.“
The Russian Orthodox Church and our other traditional faiths must have all the possibilities for carrying out full and real service in important areas such as supporting families and mothers, raising and educating children, youth policy, resolving the many social problems we still face, and strengthening patriotic spirit in the Armed Forces. This is a response to people’s vital need for moral support and spiritual guidance.
I think it important to note that the Russian Orthodox Church’s efforts to pursue fruitful dialogue within Russia’s Interfaith Council are bringing positive results. 
It is no exaggeration to say that for our country interethnic and interfaith harmony is a matter of historic importance.
Today, in Russia and in the countries where the Moscow Patriarchate has a canonical presence, among our compatriots abroad on the world’s various continents, the Russian Orthodox Church is carrying out a very important mission. It brings countries and peoples closer together and through its wise words and deeds helps to build greater understanding between them. It helps us to preserve the ties that have bound us throughout centuries and is essentially unifying the millions of people who make up the Russian world.
I would like to say a separate word of thanks to the members of the clergy from bishoprics abroad and from the autonomous and self-governing churches, especially from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, unity with which was restored more than five years ago now and has had such a productive influence on our people’s spiritual life. 
We know that wherever you are, you have always been with Russia in spirit. You perform your important service and help our compatriots to feel the unbreakable tie with their Motherland, and you work together with them for its revival, development and growth.
I want to conclude by once more wishing the Bishops’ Council and all of you productive work and all the very best.
Thank you for your attention.
