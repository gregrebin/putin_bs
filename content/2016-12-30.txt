    Events Statement by the President of Russia     December 30, 2016  15:15         We regard the recent unfriendly steps taken by the outgoing US administration as provocative and aimed at further weakening
the Russia-US relationship. This runs contrary to the fundamental interests of both the Russian and American people. Considering the global security
responsibilities of Russia and the United States, this is also damaging to international
relations as a whole.  As it proceeds from international practice,
Russia has reasons to respond in kind. Although we have the right to retaliate,
we will not resort to irresponsible ‘kitchen’ diplomacy but will plan our
further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration. The diplomats who are returning to Russia will
spend the New Year’s holidays with their families and friends. We will not
create any problems for US diplomats. We will not expel anyone. We will not
prevent their families and children from using their traditional leisure sites
during the New Year’s holidays. Moreover, I invite all children of US diplomats
accredited in Russia to the New Year and Christmas children’s parties in the Kremlin.  It is regrettable that the Obama Administration
is ending its term in this manner. Nevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings
to President Obama and his family. My season’s greetings also to President-elect
Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.
