Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
You know that a summit with the President of the United States took place two days ago. The Foreign Minister, the Defence Minister and some other ministers took part in the summit and the results are known. At the same time, I would like to say that I personally assess the summit very highly. Not only did it proceed in a very frank manner, but it was fruitful in terms of the number of issues discussed and the results â€“ not only because we have signed two concrete statements, but because we have synchronised watches on the key issues in bilateral relations and our interaction in the world. I will tell you more about it later.
That is what I wanted to tell you to start with. Let us move on to discuss the current problems.
