I would like to note right away that relations between your country and Russia are progressing successfully. We are very pleased by this.
I want to once again thank you for your decision to provide us with a tract of land in Jordan, where we have built a house for Russian pilgrims.
There are over 600 Jordanian students studying in Russia and we are continuing to work in all humanitarian areas.
In spite of the modest figures for the absolute value of our trade turnover, it is nevertheless growing quite quickly. We are developing our military technology ties. And we are always in close contact on very difficult issues in international politics.
I am very happy to see you and to have the opportunity to exchange views with you on all these matters, on this entire set of issues.
Welcome.

: Thank you, Mr President.
I’m delighted to be back here in Moscow again. I remember with great fondness your trip to Jordan last year in June. And again, I think the Russian pilgrim house on the Baptist site is of tremendous importance to all Jordanians and all Russians, and we’re very pleased that you had the opportunity to visit that site.
I’m very delighted with the warm relationship that you and I have had for many, many years, and the very important and warm relationships between our two countries, as you have mentioned. I hope that, obviously, with this visit, I’ll have the opportunity to discuss a lot of regional issues. One on the top of my mind, obviously, is the peace process, which I hope to solicit your advice on at this evening’s meetings. And also, looking at opportunities for how to improve our good economic relations, we’re very interested in improving our economic course and we have some serious discussions on certain issues that I hope to bring up today, which I think will bring us to a new level of coordination between our two countries on certain very important projects that I hope to discuss with you later in this meeting.
And as you said, our military relationships are excellent, and our continued intelligence relations in combating terrorists, wherever they may be, is outstanding, so I’m very grateful for your support to the relationship between our two countries, and I look forward to a very fruitful discussion with you this evening.
It’s a great pleasure to see you again, sir.
