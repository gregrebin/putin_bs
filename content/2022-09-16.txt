President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Aliyev, I am very happy to see you – here on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit.
We have already talked to each other many times throughout the day, exchanging views on the organisation’s work, bilateral relations and developments in the region.
As for bilateral relations, they are developing very successfully; it should be noted, of course: both trade and investment are growing, cooperation continues through various ministries, departments and the parliaments.

But, surely, today we are all very concerned about the aggravation of the situation on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. We have talked about this with you. Last night I talked – you know about this, I informed you – with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan. It is good that this escalation was finally stopped through a coordinated effort, but, as far as I understand, the situation still remains tense.
I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you and talk about all these issues, because they are all important.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: Thank you, Mr Putin, I am very pleased with our latest meeting.
Less than three months have passed since our last meeting, but we have also remained in constant contact during this period, by telephone. We also see very positive dynamics in our bilateral relations. After the signing of the Declaration on Allied Cooperation, important documents were also signed in various sectors, and in general, as you noted, we see an increase in cargo transport both in trade and in the transport sector. Also, we now intend to fully use the potential of our transit capabilities. So the results are evident, and I am sure that we will finish this year with good results in all areas.
I would also like to thank you for your prompt response to the aggravation and escalation at the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. The clashes lasted less than eight hours, and the fact that they stopped – although the Armenian side did not immediately conform to the ceasefire, in general the ceasefire has been observed for about two days – indicates that neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan had any intentions of large-scale escalation. Border conflicts happen, unfortunately. They are associated with many casualties on both sides. But the main thing is that we managed to stabilise the situation and move back to a peaceful course.
According to the information that I am receiving from the field, as I said, the situation has been stable for about two days. Now the main thing is to avoid ruining the beginning of the process of normalisation in relations, to move in this direction. We welcome Russia's efforts to this end, including within the tripartite commission at the level of deputy prime ministers from Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, for transport connections, as part of the delimitation process, as well as plans to start talks on a peace agreement. But, of course, we will discuss this in detail.
I want to say again that Azerbaijan is committed to the tripartite documents that were signed between Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia after the second Karabakh war, and we will do our best to ensure that the situation in the Caucasus is stable.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
