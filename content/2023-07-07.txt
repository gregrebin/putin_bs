President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
Today, we will discuss the measures that we are taking and must take to overcome the difficulties created by certain countries as a move against Russia. So far, they have not achieved anything significant in terms of the goals they set as regards Russia. I am sure that they will never succeed. But we need to be aware of the current developments, so let us discuss all of these issues.
I would like to ask Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to speak first. Please, you have the floor.
