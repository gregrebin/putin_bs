Vladimir Putin congratulated Russian women on International Women’s Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear women of Russia,
Please accept my heartfelt greetings on International Women’s Day.
This holiday is always full of joy, flowers, gifts, and warm and sincere feelings. We hurry to congratulate our mothers, wives, daughters, girl friends and colleagues, and express our admiration, love, respect and gratitude to them. Our dear ladies, you are the best in the world.
In some mysterious way, you manage to do so many things: to keep home comfort, be highly successful at work and in your studies, and stay adorable, beautiful and feminine. Your ability to feel deep love and empathy and take care of those close to you with joy and patience is truly amazing.
It is very important that these values are passed on from generation to generation, with daughters learning this attitude to life, family and their future children from their mothers.
Of course, special words of appreciation go to women who are committed to motherhood and bring new, unique lives into the world. They raise children and give their love to them every day, which is hard and responsible work – but it is noble and rewarding.
Dear women,
I wish you happiness from the bottom of my heart. I understand that much here depends on us, men – and we will make every effort to be worthy of you and take more responsibility. We will always do so, not just on this holiday.
Once again, my greetings to all women of Russia on this holiday. I wish you good health, love and happiness.
