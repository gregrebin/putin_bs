Speech at the Opening of the Exhibition ”Russia!“ at the Guggenheim Museum
September 15, 2005

New York
Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Krens,
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen.
It is a great honour for me to be present today at the opening of this unique exhibition of Russian art.
We have always considered the Guggenheim Museum one of the foremost centres of world culture. Today, I have been absolutely convinced of this. Not only do they know Russian art very well, but they hold it in high estime. We, on our side, value this respect for our country and our culture.
Two years ago, we were present at the opening of a different exhibition called “Amazons of the Russian Avant-Garde.” Certainly, events on such a scale would be impossible without the participation of the Kremlin's Armoury Museum, the State Hermitage, and Russian and Historical museums. Regional galleries and owners of private collections made essential contributions to this cooperative effort as well.
Business representatives have also made important contributions.
Such a union has proven fruitful and resulted in an original retrospective of Russian fine arts in the Guggenheim Museum. It seems to me that a project of this scale is the first of its kind. The life of Russian art over nine centuries is presented here.
I would especially like to emphasise that the exhibition's name reflects its contents and its point. Of course, we feel this in the masterpieces of Russian icon painters such as Andrei Rublev, and Dionisy, which are seldom exhibited abroad… I am confident that you will all feel the soul of the Russian people.
Realist painters, members of the Russian avant-garde, and modern artists are exhibited here. What is interesting, and what struck me, is that this exhibit highlights the transition between the different stages of Russian art rather than simply presenting unconnected pieces from a given period.
Of course, even a huge exhibit such as this cannot show all the wealth of Russian art. But what you see here will be enough to understand the importance of Russian culture for world civilisation. What you see here will be enough to evaluate Russia's contribution to humankind's artistic heritage and to modern civilisation.
Opening ceremonies such as this one are becoming a pleasant tradition in Russian-American relations. Certainly, they give our citizens the opportunity to better know and understand each other.
I am very grateful to you, Mr Krens, grateful to all the exhibition's organisers, to those who first had this idea, and to those who helped carry it out. Namely because such events are the best and most eloquent way to understand a country that possesses huge humanistic and spiritual potential, a country such as Russia.

Beginning of the Meeting with the First Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, Metropolitan Laurus, and the Dean of the Saint Nicholas Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), Bishop Mercurius
September 15, 2005

New York
President Vladimir Putin: Once again, I would like to thank you for your invitation. I want to repeat, not only is it pleasant for me to be in a church of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, but I am happy with this opportunity, which I see as a very important contribution to the unity of the Russian people – all Russian Orthodox people, whether abroad or on their Russian native ground. Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to bow to the Kursk-root icon, one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most venerated ones. It is also very pleasant for me to sit at this table together with Bishop Mercurius, representative of the Moscow partriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church.
I know that the dialogue between churches continues. Once again, I want to stress that – whatever the outcome of this dialogue — this is, without any doubt, exclusively the Church's doing. Once again, I want to confirm our readiness to facilitate this process in every possible way.
Allow me to thank you once again for all that you have done over many decades for Russian people who found themselves outside of their country.

Speech at the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly
September 15, 2005
22:10
New York
President Vladimir Putin: Dear heads of states and governments, dear Secretary General, Ladies and Gentlemen. Six decades of the world's destiny are inextricably linked to the United Nations' activity. The UN dates from the end of the Second World War and is one of the most eloquent symbols of the victory over Nazism.
We remember how belief in ideals such as freedom and humanism rallied the world's peoples in a common struggle. The creation of the UN was civilised humanity's clear manifestation that new destructive wars, and barbarous ideologies preaching violence, agression, and racial superiority, must not be allowed.
Over 60 years, the UN has known both heated discussions and striking contradictions, but became a unique platform for systematic dialogue between nations on how to construct a safer world. Within these walls, many ideas of detente, a common quest, and the bases of a new, non-confrontational world order were launched. Looking back, it is necessary to give the UN due credit.
In new historical conditions, both the UN's experience, authority and supreme legitimacy allow it to play an irreplaceable and unique role in global politics, and economic, cultural and educational cooperation.
Two years ago, I spoke about Russia's basic approach towards increasing the Organisation's efficiency at this same lectern. In this issue, our position remains consistent and unchanging.
Indeed, the Organisation must be adapted to new historical realities. But this process should be a creative one. It should take both UN's acquisitions and the lessons it has learned into account. And it should rally people rather than separate them.
It is only on the basis of wide consent that we can further strengthen the UN's authority and legitimacy, and its ability to answer 21st century challenges more effectively.
I am convinced that today, terrorism represents the main danger to the rights and freedom of mankind, and to the steady development of states and peoples.
In connection with this, the UN and the Security Council should be the headquarters for coordinating international cooperation in the struggle against terror – Nazism's ideological successor.
They must also help coordinate the settlement of deep-rooted regional conflicts on which terrorists and extremists of all kinds breed by using the historical baggage of religious, ethnic and social inequalities.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is necessary to use not only states' ressources but, most importantly, the large opportunities offered by civil society, mass media, cultural and educational cooperation, and interconfessional dialogue to oppose ideologues that preach a clash of civilisations, and terrorist agression.
Who if not the UN can take on this coordinating and organising role? Here it can base itself on the support of all member countries, on the cooperation of influential international organisations, and on regional integration associations.
Russia intends to increase her participation both in the international reaction to crises, and in assistance for development and progress. Next year, within the framework of Russia's presidency in the G8, in the CIS, and the Council of Europe we will continue to work together on this major issue.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
In conclusion, I would like to wish the summit success. And I would like to wish the UN stronger influence and authority over the international community. Let us not forget that the Organisation belongs to all of us, rather than to any one of us. Let us have the wisdom to save it for subsequent generations.
Thank you for your attention.

Beginning of the meeting with the President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
September 15, 2005
23:35
New York
President Vladimir Putin: Russia and Iran have always had close relations. We have always been neighbours and we always will be. There is a great deal of cooperation between our countries, and it takes place in multiple areas. Suffice to say that last year, the volume of trade grew by 43 percent. We have many shared regional interests, including in the area of the Caspian Sea.
I hope that after your election, this positive dynamic will continue. Moreover, as far as I know, while you were Mayor of Tehran you established very positive relations with our largest cities: Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
You already have a significant amount of positive experience in direct cooperation with Russia.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (translated from Russian): Many thanks. I would like to thank you for the complimentary message you sent me. It was both friendly and sincere and is an indicator of the depth and breadth of our bilateral relations.
As you have already noted, historical and natural conditions have traditionally resulted in a very close connection between our countries. On the regional, bilateral and international levels, our countries' interests are very close.
My trip to Moscow and meeting with Moscow Mayor Mr Luzhkov have left me with pleasant memories. The visits of Moscow and Saint Petersburg leadership have allowed relations with these regions to become closer. As you noted, we have many common interests in the region of the Caspian Sea. Our government is prepared to develop long-term relations with Russia. We are very happy that recent circumstances have allowed you to successfully resolve many of Russia's problems, and to strengthen your country's international authority. We recognise that a powerful Russia is Iran's best friend and that a powerful Iran is one of Russia's best partners. For this reason, we are glad that the Russian Federation's international status and state power are being strengthened.
