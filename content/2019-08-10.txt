With members of Night Wolves Motorclub.
This was the 11th Shadow of Babylon bike show, organised by Night Wolves Motorclub in Crimea. The first biker convention took place near Mount Gasfort in 2009.
Shows staged by the Night Wolves are always devoted to patriotic topics. When preparing their events, the bikers find inspiration in episodes from Soviet and Russian history, mostly related to important military victories.
This yearâ€™s Shadow of Babylon show offers a large-scale performance featuring special effects and stunts, fireworks and music with popular Russian artists as headliners.
