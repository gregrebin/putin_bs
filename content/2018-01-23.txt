At meeting for Supreme Court 95th anniversary.
The history of Russia’s supreme legislative authority for civil, criminal and administrative cases and economic disputes began with the establishment of the Supreme Court of the RSFSR in 1923. In 2014, the Supreme Court was merged with the Higher Arbitration Court.

Speech at a meeting dedicated to the 95th anniversary of the Supreme Court of Russia
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lebedev, colleagues and friends,
I would like to begin by congratulating you on the 95th anniversary of the Supreme Court of Russia and wishing professional success to the court’s judges and staff. I am sincerely grateful to the veterans for their years of hard work in the country’s judicial system and for their contribution to strengthening law and order in the country.
The Supreme Court played an invaluable role in the creation of a streamlined judicial practice and greatly contributed to the regulation of the national legislation and the promotion of vital judicial reforms.
At meeting for Supreme Court 95th anniversary.
In the early 1990s, the Supreme Court was actually the driving force behind the reforms that have changed the Russian judicial framework, which is now based on such fundamental principles as independence, accessibility, openness, immunity and irremovability of judges, and the adversarial nature of the judicial process. Of course, not all problems have been resolved. But the basic principles have taken root and are being improved and strengthened.
The courts, including the Supreme Court, consider millions of cases every year, and each case involves human lives.
Summarising the judicial practice, the Supreme Court ensures a uniform understanding and application of legal norms, actually providing an official interpretation of legal acts. This helps uphold the constitutional principles of the rule of law and equality before the law and court.
The Supreme Court’s law-making activity is of vital importance. It fills the gaps in legislation, eliminating controversy, streamlining many clauses and giving them greater clarity. It is important that this work meets the needs of the citizens and the national economy, and fits with modern trends emerging in the age of rapid technological change. One must always remember that law is shaped by life itself.
In this regard, I would like to note that the merger of the Supreme Court and Higher Arbitration Court has helped to resolve differences in the legal positions on a number of important issues, to achieve uniformity of judicial practice, and greater legal certainty, which is very important for the development of the economy and entrepreneurship, thereby ensuring the principle of equality of citizens before the law. We all remember when absolutely different rulings were passed on the same cases in the arbitration courts system and in general jurisdiction courts. Thank God, this is history now.
At meeting for Supreme Court 95th anniversary.
In 2012 and 2013, appeals proceedings on civil and criminal cases were introduced. This legal institution was sponsored by the Supreme Court and has proved itself in the best possible way.
Since 2016, Russians can file lawsuits and submit other documents online. This increased the accessibility of justice, and has helped reduce the time needed for the consideration of cases and avoid unnecessary red tape.
This is only part of the great work done by the Supreme Court to strengthen Russian justice.
Colleagues, an independent, modern and efficient judicial system is essential for developing a democratic social state ruled by law, a free, responsible and active civil society, a strong economy and a competitive business environment.
Clearly, Russian courts, primarily the supreme judicial authority, must have all the capabilities to reliably and effectively ensure the right of our citizens to judicial protection. It is a key constitutional provision, which must be complied with unconditionally.
It is notable that the Supreme Court is modernising the judicial system and improving its operation. In particular, the establishment of general district courts of appeals and cassation will offer new opportunities for appealing court decisions. These district courts will be based on principles of extraterritorial jurisdiction, which will enhance their independence.
Jointly with experts, the Supreme Court has drafted a series of amendments to legislation regarding procedural and institutional forms of judicial activity. I assure you that I have studied them carefully. I have held several meetings with Mr Lebedev to discuss these amendments. I believe that they will help improve the legal framework of the court procedure.

Specifically, there are plans to decrease the courts’ workload by removing irrelevant issues and documents, which take up so much of the judges’ time but are rarely required in reality.
The court has proposed many innovations, for example, in organising the work of the presidents of courts. We must review and analyse all these proposals carefully and without undue haste before taking a decision.
Of course, we must avoid mistakes in this delicate sphere that is of crucial significance for the state, and the new laws must definitely not be applied retroactively.
It is obvious – I believe that our colleagues in this room and those who are attending this meeting via videoconference will agree – that judges and presidents of courts must be relieved of managerial or organisational duties that are not part of the judicial profession. These duties could be turned over to court administrators, as the Supreme Court has proposed. This would improve the quality of court proceedings and the objectivity and independence of judges, reduce corruption risks and lastly, relieve judges from non-relevant managerial duties.
In addition, there is a proposal to introduce a new measure of disciplinary liability for judges, namely, lowering their qualification class. Of course, the criteria must be defined first that would draw a clear line between a judicial error and a disciplinary offence.
Additional authority will be given to assistant judges, in particular, they will be entitled to draw up draft judicial rulings. It is no secret that this has long been done in practical work because of judges’ heavy workload. At the same time, of course, assistant judges must have the proper qualifications and experience.
Introduction of information technology is another important issue, without which modern legal proceedings are inconceivable. For example, it has been proposed to introduce an automated distribution of cases between judges in courts, as well as mandatory audio recording of court sessions. As you may be aware, this is already widely used in practice.
At meeting for Supreme Court 95th anniversary.
I would like the Supreme Court to cooperate with parliamentarians, so that the above legislative initiatives are adopted as soon as possible. Of course, I would like to emphasise once again, they must be thoroughly elaborated. This will improve the accessibility and openness of the judicial system, and will, therefore, provide more effective guarantees of the rights, freedoms and interests of Russian citizens.
Colleagues, the Supreme Court today pays much attention to personnel policy. Picking candidates for the position of judge has become a more thorough process. Family members can no longer work in courts of procedural subordination. The practice of declaring incomes by candidates for judicial positions is being improved, as are other measures for combating corruption. This practice is important and needs to continue.
A modern judge must be a professional, strictly observe the law, and serve as an example of personal integrity and independence. Of course, judges must have high legal culture and respect the participants of the proceedings. Such judges will enjoy credibility with the people, and their work and irreproachable conduct of the process will serve to increase the standing of the judiciary in our society.
Colleagues, in closing I would like to once again congratulate you on your anniversary, and to thank the judges, the Supreme Court staff, and the entire judiciary of Russia for the vast and extremely important work you are performing in good faith.
I wish you new successes. Thank you.

Beginning of meeting with President of the Argentine Republic Mauricio Macri
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, it is a pleasure to welcome you to Moscow and Russia.
Relations between Russia and Argentina are deeply rooted in the past, going back to 1885 when they were established.
Up to this day, Argentina remains one of our priority partners in Latin America. Our total trade is not so large; however, there was a slight growth, by just over 3 percent, over ten months of last year.
Fortunately, our relations are quite diversified and we have many areas of prospective cooperation.
I am certain we will discuss the upcoming major sports event, the World Cup in Russia. We will be glad to see you, Mr President, and numerous football fans from your country.
Welcome!
President of the Argentine Republic Mauricio Macri (retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much for your invitation.
I am happy to be here where I can convey the love the Argentinean people feel for you and express our gratitude and desire to work with you. Argentina greatly appreciates its strategic partnership with Russia. The memorandum we signed in December seals our desire to continue to deepen our relationship.
I would also like to use this opportunity to thank you. After we spoke on the phone, our Russian partners provided relief assistance to our efforts to find the missing submarine San Juan. This is yet further evidence of Russia’s love for Argentina.
I fully agree with you that there are many areas where we can continue to grow together, like trade, culture and sports. I firmly believe that after this meeting we will strengthen our relations under your guidance.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, as you may know, Russia has had its share of submarine disasters. We know how the families of the missing seamen feel. This explains our natural desire to help you search for the missing submarine.
Argentina has the largest Russian diaspora in Latin America: 300,000 people. I would like to thank you for your warm attitude to our compatriots, including support for their initiatives on interaction in the humanitarian area.
This year Argentina holds the rotating G20 presidency, and we would be grateful if you told us about your priorities. We would be glad to join you in your efforts.
Thank you.

Press statements following the talks with President of Argentine Republic Mauricio Macri
Following Russian-Argentinian talks, Vladimir Putin and Mauricio Macri made statements for the media.

The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin and Mauricio Macri made statements for the media.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
The talks with President of Argentina, Mr Mauricio Macri, were marked by a businesslike and constructive atmosphere. We exchanged views on the entire range of issues of bilateral cooperation, outlined new goals and long-term benchmarks for cooperation, and touched upon important issues of the international agenda.
Russia and Argentina are bound by a historically strong friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation. Relations between our countries were established back in 1885 and have always been based on the principles of respect and consideration of each other's interests.
During the talks, Mr Macri and I reiterated our commitment to the progressive development of relations between our states, and the comprehensive strengthening of our strategic partnership.
The Joint Statement that we have just signed includes a number of important agreements on expanding cooperation in key areas such as the economy, foreign policy, defence industry cooperation, and culture, to name a few.
Of course, we discussed the search for the missing Argentinean submarine San Juan. Russia sincerely sympathises with the families and friends of the missing sailors. We ourselves are familiar with such tragedies.
We readily responded to President Macri's request for assistance in the search for the boat. The Yantar oceanographic vessel of the Russian Navy and the underwater rescue vehicles Panther Plus and Falcon were promptly sent to the search area. Twenty dives were performed, and about 340 square miles of the seabed were surveyed. We provide other assistance to Argentina in clarifying the circumstances and causes of what happened.
During the talks, we discussed bilateral economic cooperation in detail. Argentina is one of Russia's leading trade partners in Latin America. From January to November 2017, trade grew by 3.1 percent. The President of Argentina and I agreed to continue systemic efforts to develop trade and investment ties. These issues should be closely dealt with by the Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation, at its next meeting, which will be held in Moscow two weeks from now.
It is also important to step up the work of the Council of Entrepreneurs of the two countries. Today, Mr Macri met with the heads of major Russian companies, and he could personally see that our companies are interested in implementing joint projects with their Argentinean partners.
Rosatom is proposing a nuclear power plant of Russian design in Argentina based on the latest and safest technological standards. Russian Railways is ready to join the programme to modernise the railways of Argentina, and to supply modern rolling stock. Transmashholding and Sinara plan to invest in the construction of service facilities and the production of railway equipment. With Gazprom-Bank participation, a major logistics complex will be built at a port in Buenos Aires province. Power Machines services power units at five Argentine hydroelectric power plants and plans to participate in the bidding for the supply of equipment for six more HPPs.
Russia and Argentina are establishing cooperation in the peaceful exploration of outer space. There are ideas on cooperation in the area of remote sensing of the Earth and satellite navigation. Roscosmos could share its experience in creating space equipment, and deliver rocket engines that are competitive and are still being supplied to many countries, including the United States, by the way, despite the restrictions we all know about. We are ready to supply special fuel as well.
Mr Macri and I touched on cultural contacts as well. In 2017, gala concerts by soloists from the Bolshoi Theatre, the Mariinsky Theatre and the Mikhailovsky Theatre from St Petersburg were successfully held in Argentina. A Russian Centre of Culture and Art called “Moscow” opened in a Buenos Aires suburb.
In turn, Argentinean theatre plays were included in the Chekhov International Theatre Festival programme in Moscow. Tango dancers from Argentina participated in the Moscow International Contest of Ballet Dancers and Choreographers. Films by Argentinean directors were shown at the 39th International Moscow Film Festival.
I invited the President of Argentina to come to Russia again in summer for the World Cup. Of course, we look forward to Argentinean fans coming to our country and supporting their team, which is certainly one of the favourites in the upcoming championship.
During our exchange of views on the global and regional agendas, the President and I said that we were on the same page regarding most matters.
We intend to expand coordination with our Argentinean partners in international organisations, such as the UN and the World Trade Organisation; and to promote our ties in integration associations, such as the Eurasian Economic Union and the South American Common Market.
Russia will participate in the G20 summit, which will be held in Argentina this year. We share Argentina’s priorities in the G20 and are committed to practical cooperation as we strive to promote them.
In closing, I would like to thank Mr President, and all our Argentine colleagues and friends for their productive joint work during this visit. I am convinced that it will contribute to the further development of bilateral ties between Russia and Argentina.
Thank you.
President of the Argentine Republic Mauricio Macri (retranslated): Good afternoon.
Once again, I would like to thank Mr President for the invitation.
When we met a year and a half ago, we agreed how important an integrated strategic partnership between our countries is. This is my first official visit to Russia, but I hope it will be the first of many. I also want to thank you for Russia’s love and warmth to Argentina and for helping in the search for the San Juan submarine. We deeply appreciated that effort.
I am confident that Argentina and Russia have common interests in our various relations; we must continue in energy, culture, sports, technology, and military technical cooperation. Today we discussed all this and found that there are so many areas in which we could cooperate, and this cooperation will undoubtedly create even more opportunities for our peoples. This is in tune with the changes that Argentina is living through, which is now beginning its adaptation to the world and wants to materialize my commitment, the most important commitment as the Argentine President – to reduce poverty and provide opportunities for all.
As we take on the G-20 presidency, we are determined to show that Argentina is not only a representative, but Argentina is also an entire region, which is a peaceful region that offers many opportunities in the food industry, energy, and especially in renewable energy. And, as we said before, we hope that our countries will complement each other. Our countries are complementary. This should lead to an increase in trade.
Argentina has entered the global arena with a view to participating in these global interests. We hope that we will work together in the fight against terrorism and in security. As we see, our agenda is very dynamic, and is full of opportunities. As you said, I had breakfast with representatives of several major Russian companies this morning. We are now opening an agro-industrial representation office in Moscow, Russia. This is our fifth such unit in the world. We are confident that we can be a food supplier to Russia, and can also exchange technology to increase and promote production in Russia.
I thank you once again. This meeting should give impetus to cooperation. And, as we said, I really hope to visit here again; I would like to come with my daughter Antonia, who never stops talking about the World Cup – I would like to attend the final match. I hope that we will play in the final match and that we are more fortunate than Brazil. But the most important thing is, of course, to participate in the competition. Our Lord and Messi will decide if we can win the World Cup.
I am very grateful that we have done some very intensive and productive work.
Thank you.
