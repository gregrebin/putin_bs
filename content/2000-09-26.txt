The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: The Declaration on Allied Cooperation that was signed today formalises the current state of bilateral relations. This is a long-term agreement showing that the peoples of our countries want to carry on their historical traditions.

Robert Kocharian: I want a peaceful Caucasus without any lines of demarcation. This desire requires that the South Caucasian leaders should carry out a highly responsible policy and refrain from creating new lines of demarcation.
Vladimir Putin: The Caucasus is a unique region celebrated for its different religions and cultures, and its diverse history. Nonetheless, I am convinced that it is a place whose people have a common future. In the future I want us to be proud of our relationship with the Caucasus, a prosperous region that would serve as an example for the rest of humankind. I would like the Caucasus to show how local nations can live together by taking advantage of each of their respective strong points.

Question: How can Russia help settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict?
Vladimir Putin: It is our opinion that the complicated Karabakh problem should be primarily solved by the two sovereign states, Armenia and Azerbaijan. We will agree with any option suitable to both nations and their leaders. We will support the dialogue between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which represents a major step forward and a display of goodwill on the part of both leaders. And we will also contribute to the cause of peace. We understand that peace, unfortunately, cannot be achieved as quickly as we would like. But Russia is interested in regional peace and harmony between nations.
