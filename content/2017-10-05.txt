Meeting with winners of the 2017 Teacher of the Year national contest.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. First of all, I would like to congratulate all of you.
Remark: Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Congratulations on being part of the group of top professionals, there are fifteen of you, am I right? The fifteen best teachers of the year. I am sure the choice was not easy, it was made by experts whom you can trust, and this means it is based on objective criteria of the quality of your work.
I would like to thank you and to wish you all the best.
Remark: Thank you.
Education and Science Minister Olga Vasilyeva
: Mr President, one or two questions, with your permission.
Ivan Smirnov: Mr President, good afternoon.
My name is Ivan Smirnov; I am a biology teacher at Moscow School No 171.
Moscow is actively developing pre-professional education: it opens medicine, cadet, engineering and chemical classes to help children make an informed choice of their future career. Upon graduation, they take pre-professional exams. I think this kind of experience might be interesting for the regions as well.
Therefore, my question, or suggestion is the following: when enrolling in a university, a graduate can receive up to ten additional points for their achievements portfolio. I believe those who took pre-professional training and passed the examination are motivated and will become good professionals. Is there a possibility to increase the number of points for pre-professional training to 25?
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: First of all, this is a good practice, the sooner this career decision takes place, the better. Therefore, I absolutely support this idea; it should be worked out with the Ministry of Education.
Olga Vasilyeva: Mr President, Ivan holds a Ph.D. at the Lomonosov Moscow State University Biology Department.
Vladimir Putin: This is impressive, and the proposal is good.
Ilya Demakov: Mr President, my name is Ilya Demakov; I am a history teacher from St Petersburg.
Several years ago, in a similar situation my colleague asked you whom of the Russian historical figures you would call the most important. I would like to know, on his behalf too, if your opinion has changed since then.
Vladimir Putin: And what did I say then?
Ilya Demakov: Alexander III.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, Alexander III was a prominent political figure, one of the builders of our state.
We have had many prominent personalities. It is hard to name just one. Actually, the key figure is the people. Their moral and ethical qualities should be studied because this is where the power is, as well as the foundation of everything.

Vladimir Putin congratulated Russian teachers on their professional holiday.
Earlier the President met with the winners of the 2017 Teacher of the Year national contest.
Speech at gala evening marking Teachers’ Day
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
It is my sincere pleasure to congratulate all of you, all Russian teachers on your professional holiday – Teachers’ Day. Congratulations!
This is a holiday that is close to all of our hearts, because teaching is not just a job but a calling, a challenging and weighty mission. And we all remember our mentors with special gratitude and appreciation for their sincere love, care and wise advice.
Good teachers always impart much more than what is contained in the curriculum. They help young people, teenagers, children to understand themselves, to reveal their best qualities and ultimately to find their own way in life. You, at least the vast majority of you, invest a bit of your soul in your students and try to show them the importance of decency, fairness, trust, respect for each other and love of country.
I am convinced that it is impossible to become a thinking, decent and free person without such basic, fundamental values. These concepts, these moral foundations cannot be learned from a textbook or downloaded from the internet; this moral foundation is laid by the daily work of teachers and solidified by their personal example and personal engagement with students.
Of course, teachers need to feel the payoff of their work, to know that their daily efforts are duly appreciated by the state and society. In recent years, much has been done to bolster the profession’s prestige and social status, and such work will certainly continue.
Today's holiday, Teachers’ Day, is also a great opportunity for all students, both current and former, to once again say thank you to their teachers, to express all their gratitude and appreciation.
Friends, our country has always taken pride in the quality of our education, our strong teaching traditions, and our outstanding vocational training. We need to carefully preserve this legacy, and use all the best – programmes, methods, and approaches – from the experience we have already amassed.
However, Russian education must certainly meet the highest requirements of not only today but also tomorrow. This concerns the content of the educational process and the technical equipment of schools.
We have many strong educational institutions with established reputations. It is gratifying to know that the number of new leading schools is growing year in and year out, and not only in major cities. The rankings of Russia’s best schools this year were compiled using 72 Russian regions, including cities such as Saransk, Kirovsk, Omsk, Kazan, and many others. The programme for building and upgrading general education institutions is being actively promoted. By the end of this year alone, 170 schools will have been opened, which translates to almost 100,000 new slots for students.
In general, our goal is to create a truly modern educational environment that is comfortable for both teachers and students, and provides all the necessary conditions for developing the creative abilities of children and teenagers.
We are rightly proud of the successes of our children, their victories at international competitions in general subjects. This, by the way, speaks volumes about the high quality of our education, and the high achievements of the entire educational system of the Russian Federation. But you know better than anyone else that the talents your students demonstrated during academic competitions derive from one very simple truth – every student has talent. So, if a teacher was able to help a pupil gain entry to a competition, to win a competition, it means that the teacher managed to find a ”spark“ in that pupil. The mission of the teacher is to find that ”spark“ in each student that can lead him or her to outstanding heights.
Much depends on the personality of the teachers, their skills and competencies. We will be developing a system that allows teachers to constantly improve their skills, and share best practices among themselves. Of course, we, like no one else, know that teachers must constantly learn as well.
In closing, I would like to say thank you to all the teachers, and wish success to your students. Their achievements and victories are the best testimony to your professionalism and devotion to your chosen path.
I already had the opportunity to congratulate 15 laureates, the best teachers of the year, chosen by the professional community. I congratulate them and, addressing the wider audience, I want to congratulate all teachers of Russia on their professional holiday.
Thank you very much and have a nice evening.

With King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, colleagues and friends,
Let me cordially welcome you to Russia’s capital, Moscow. Thank you very much for accepting our invitation and coming on a visit. This is the first visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to Russia in the history of our relations, and this itself is a landmark event.
Our relations have a fairly long history. In 1926, 90 years ago, even more, our country, the Soviet Union at that time, was the first state to recognise the newly formed Kingdom created by Abdulaziz bin Al Saud. And now we are very pleased to receive you here, Your Majesty. I am confident that your visit will serve as a good impetus for the development of our intergovernmental relations.
Welcome.
King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia
(retranslated): I am grateful to you, Your Excellency, Mr President, for the warm welcome.
We are happy to visit your friendly country. We are striving to strengthen bilateral relations in the interests of peace and security, in the interests of developing the world economy.

Beginning of Russian-Saudi talks in expanded format

Russian-Saudi talks in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, colleagues. Allow me to welcome you once again, now in an expanded format.
We have just completed talks in narrow format, which were very in-depth. We spoke about our bilateral relations and the situation in the region. It was a very informative, substantive and trust-based discussion.
I would like to say once again that we are glad to welcome the King of Saudi Arabia on a visit, which is the first in the history of our relations. I believe that this visit will give a new strong impetus to the development of bilateral relations.
King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia
(retranslated): In the name of Allah most gracious, most merciful.
Gentlemen, Mr President,
First of all, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your warm welcome and hospitality that we received in this friendly country.
We value the warm feelings towards our country that you expressed in your remarks. We enjoy visiting this friendly country to confirm our commitment to strengthening and improving the relations between our countries and peoples in various areas.
It should be noted that these relations are defined by common perspectives on many regional and international problems.
We continue coordinating our actions in every area that contributes to the higher security and prosperity in our states, in every area that promotes international peace and security. We are striving to continue the positive cooperation between our states to achieve stability in the global oil market, which will facilitate global economic growth.
We strongly believe that there are great opportunities to expand and diversify the scope of our economic cooperation, to establish the trade, economic and investment foundation that would enhance the use of our specifics for the benefit of our countries and in the interests of developing trade throughout industries according to the Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 programme.
The international community today is called upon to energise its efforts against extremism, terrorism and the sources of their financing. Realising the enormous danger that terrorism and extremism pose for the security and stability of countries and peoples, Saudi Arabia called for establishing an international counter-terrorism centre under the aegis of the UN and provided $110 million for this centre. Saudi Arabia established a military Islamic coalition that now comprises 41 Muslim states, and initiated the opening of a global centre in Riyadh to combat extremist ideology.
We are stressing the importance of putting an end to the suffering of the Palestinians, and speaking in favour of the Arab Peace Initiative and international law serving as a basis for achieving overarching, just and permanent peace that would ensure the Palestinians’ right to create their own independent state with a capital in East Jerusalem.
We are also stressing that the security and stability in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East is the most eagerly sought-after and essential pre-requisite for achieving security and stability in the world. This requires that Iran abandon attempts to interfere in the domestic affairs of the states in the region and stop the activity that destabilises the region.
We are stressing the significance of a political resolution of the Yemeni crisis based on the Persian Gulf states’ initiative, its implementation methods, the results of Yemen’s National Dialogue and UN Security Council Resolution 2216, which ensures Yemen’s unity, security and stability.
As concerns the Syrian crisis, we are committed to pushing for its resolution in line with the Geneva I decisions and UN Security Council Resolution 2254, to finding a political solution that would guarantee security, stability and Syria’s unity and territorial integrity. We call for the international community to take responsibility for the issues of Rohingya Muslims and find a solution that would protect them from violence and put an end to their suffering. We are also stressing the importance of preserving Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity and unification of the domestic front against terrorism. Finally, I am pleased to extend my invitation to the President to visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to continue and complete our consultations, and to improve the cooperation between our countries in all areas. Thank you once again to you, Mr President, and the Russian Government for the warm welcome and hospitality. We wish your country and the friendly Russian people further progress and prosperity.
Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, thank you very much. Thank you for the invitation. I remember my previous trip to your country, and by all means I accept your invitation to visit Saudi Arabia once again.
