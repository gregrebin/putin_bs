Press statements following the talks with Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria Sebastian Kurz
Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria Sebastian Kurz (retranslated): (In Russian.)Welcome!
Mr Federal President of Austria and Mr President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues from the Government, Mr Vice Chancellor and, first of all, Mr President.
Please allow me to cordially welcome you in Austria and sincerely thank you for choosing Austria for your first visit to the European Union after your re-election.
Welcome to Austria!
It is my impression that relations between Austria and Russia have been progressing very well for a long time. We maintained cooperation even in difficult times. Apart from good political cooperation we have very strong economic cooperation.
We are glad that our trade has again increased to 5 billion euros and that Austrian companies have already invested 7 billion euros in Russia. This year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of gas supplies from Russian to Austria owing to cooperation between Gazprom and OMV. This cooperation was always sustained even in trying times.
Today we signed a memorandum on cooperation in forestry and an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation so as to support our cooperation. Last but not the least, tourism from Russia to Austria is also developing on a large scale. We have recorded 2.1 million overnight stays in Austria.
Observance of human rights is very important for us. Today, we had an opportunity to talk about international issues – how Russia as a superpower is playing a big role in Syria and eastern Ukraine and bears a large responsibility. And we hope Russia will help people finally experience what they have been looking forward to so much – peace.
We spoke today about relations between Russia and Austria. As you know, Austria is an active EU member. On July 1, we will take over the Presidency of the EU Council and will actively participate in the formation of the EU position and EU decisions, including those on sanctions. At the same time we hope that owing to more intensive dialogue the EU and Russia will make progress in their relations.
In addition, we hope that progress will also be achieved in eastern Ukraine and that the Minsk agreements will be implemented. This is the scenario we want for our continent. We are deeply convinced that solely through cooperation and joint actions we can make further progress in relations between the two sides.
Mutual benefit is better than mutual loss. This is why we will continue working to maintain our traditionally good bilateral ties and support them more actively. We will continue working to sustain our good relations with Russia, the UN and the OSCE. We will be making our contribution to finding a decent solution for people that does not rely solely on military force.
Please allow me to thank you again for your visit to Austria, and for the good conversation with the Federal President, the Vice Chancellor and me. I am already looking forward to the exchanges and conversations between representatives of our economies.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen,
To begin with, I would like to thank the Austrian hosts for the warm welcome and hospitality. Mr Sebastian Kurz and I are already meeting for the second time this year. As in February in Moscow, our talks took place in a constructive and friendly atmosphere and reaffirmed the partner-like, mutually beneficial character of Russia-Austria cooperation.
This is shown by the substantial growth of trade between our countries – last year it went up by 40.5 percent and continues to grow. It doubled in the first quarter of this year. Our visit is timed to the 50th anniversary of the first contract on natural gas supplies from the Soviet Union. During this half century our country has been reliably supplying Austrian consumers with energy resources. Moreover, they are delivered to the markets of other European countries via Austrian territory. And so it is no exaggeration to say that Russia and Austria are jointly making a substantial contribution to the energy security of the whole of Europe.
We are working together to expand energy cooperation. Today our leading energy companies – OMV and Gazprom – signed an agreement on gas supplies until 2040.
The Nord Stream 2 project continues to be carried out. The Federal Chancellor confirmed that the Austrian leaders are positive about it as a strictly economic project.
During the talks, we addressed issues related to increasing mutual investments in industrial and technological cooperation. Russian capital investments, as I already said after the meeting with the President, are nearing $24 billion, while the figure for Austria is approaching four billion.
The Declaration on Partnership for Modernisation, adopted in 2011, is being implemented. As part of it, 28 joint initiatives totalling almost three billion euros are being implemented.
I would like to highlight the major infrastructure project to build a wide-gauge railway line from Kosice in Slovakia to Vienna. It is still in the stage of expert study, but it is now clear that in case of its implementation, cargo transportation between Europe and Asia via the Trans-Siberian Railway will increase significantly, while costs for end users will be reduced.
Of course, we also exchanged views on a number of issues on the international and regional agenda. And we talked about developments in Ukraine. I informed the Federal Chancellor about how Russia sees further possibilities for settlement in Donbass. It is significant that both Russia and Austria are in favour of full and rigorous compliance by all parties to the conflict with the Minsk agreements.
We discussed the Syrian crisis. We note the readiness of Austria to join humanitarian actions in support of the population of Syria. I have already said it many times, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate once again: if Europe wants the flow of migrants to Europe, including from this region – from Syria, from neighbouring countries – to decrease, it is necessary to help people to return to their homes, to help them to rebuild their lives in their own country.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the Federal Chancellor for useful and informative talks. Our joint programme will be continued. There are two more important events to be held, also timed to the 50th anniversary of the first gas contract.
We will meet with representatives of the business community, and then we will attend the opening of the exhibition, Old Masters from the Hermitage, at the Vienna Art History Museum.
I would like to thank you all, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention to our work.
Thank you very much.

Address at the opening of the exhibition Old Masters from the Hermitage at the Vienna Art History Museum
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal President, Mr Federal Chancellor, friends,
We are opening a unique exhibition of select masterpieces from two of the world’s greatest museums. This joint project of the State Hermitage Museum and the Vienna Art History Museum became reality with the support of the Russian company Gazprom, as Mr President has already said, and Austria’s OMV. This is a kind of gift to mark the anniversary of energy cooperation between the two countries.
I think the exhibition has an extraordinary and unique concept. It is a one-of-a-kind experiment. The Hermitage and the Vienna Art History Museum selected 14 paintings each by the most prominent masters of the 16th and 17th centuries.
These paintings are from the collections that used to belong to the Austrian and Russian imperial families. The masterpieces by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and other great artists were brought together in meaningful duos. I do not recall seeing anything like this before. I think this is the first project of this kind.
This could only be achieved by two of the world’s most outstanding museums that have big enough collections to pair these works in this way. Each duo is united by either the creator or a similar story or composition. I am certain that this project will be very popular with art lovers.
I would like to emphasise that during today’s meetings with Mr President and Mr Federal Chancellor we praised the current level of our countries’ interaction in culture and identified our short-term plans, including large-scale humanitarian events.
We are going to follow-up the Cross Year of Tourism, which has just come to a close, with the Year of Music in 2018, whereas 2019 will be marked by youth exchanges.
This exhibition will also be presented in St Petersburg in autumn. I am confident that alongside other joint cultural projects, it will further contribute to Russian-Austrian cooperation, and will serve to enhance friendship between our countries.
In conclusion, because this is indeed my last public address, I would like to sincerely thank Mr Federal Chancellor and Mr President for the truly friendly, very open business atmosphere they created during our joint work today.
I am sure that such commitment to interaction cannot but have good, positive and far-reaching consequences for our nations in all cooperation areas, including economic cooperation.
Events such as this one today will undoubtedly create the necessary atmosphere. It was very interesting for me to see the museum itself. I thought the Hermitage has no rivals in the world; however, I am now aware that there are rivals, and it is indeed a special element of pan-European cooperation. Mr Schroeder can take delight in the fact that in addition to the Dresden Opera, Gottfried Semper also built this wonderful, magnificent building especially for the museum.
Thank you very much for today’s event. I would like to thank the organisers of the exhibition and wish its visitors enjoyable impressions and all the very best.
Thank you for your attention.

News conference following talks with Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen
Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen (retranslated): Mr President,
I am very happy to welcome you here in Vienna. I am especially pleased that President Putin made one of the first foreign trips after his election to Austria, to Vienna.
This was my first meeting with you as the Federal President but many years ago I met with you in the Austrian Parliament. I think I can say that together we found a good foundation for dialogue.
News conference with Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen.
Good relations with Russia are important for me not only in the context of European policy but also for personal reasons. Russia played an important role in my family history – my parents spoke Russian with each other and I literally grew up on Russian literature although today this is no more than marginalia.
Russia and Austria have traditionally maintained very good relations that have a centuries-long history. These relations are not only political but also embrace such areas as culture, science, research, and music. For instance, 2018 is the Year of Music. Several days ago Schoenbrunn Palace hosted a wonderful concert in which Anna Netrebko and other performers took part.
One more important example of our cooperation is the joint commission on historical issues that is making a major contribution to facilitating understanding between our countries. And the importance of this commission should not be underrated. Usually or rather very often it is historians that influence the perception of different events by citizens of this or other country. For example, the French certainly write about Napoleon in a somewhat different way than Austrians or Russians.
We are also striving to promote understanding on the ground floor, so to speak – by developing direct contacts between ordinary citizens of our countries. This is why we discussed today the formation of an additional platform for dialogue at the civil society level. The first event opening this dialogue will take place today in Sochi. Ms Kneissl is taking part in its preparation on our behalf.
Of course, Russia is a very important market, including for Austria. Our direct investment in Russia is about seven billion euros, and Russian investment is 3–4 times larger.
Yesterday we marked a special anniversary: 50 years since the agreement on gas supplies from Russia to Austria was signed. The agreement was signed in 1968, between the Soviet Union and Austria back then. This means that Gazprom and OMV have been working together for 50 years. I believe this cooperation over the course of several decades already is mutually beneficial.
At a news conference with Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen.
Soon, in less than a month, Austria will take over the Presidency of the EU Council. Unfortunately, I have to say that we live in a time when the tensions around the world are constantly growing. Austria has always tried to contribute to de-escalation, and we will continue to do so in the future.
Unfortunately, the issue of sanctions is very acute today, and, concerning foreign policy, Austria acts in concert with the other countries of the European Union, and will continue to act in concert with them. But at the same time dialogue with Russia has always been extremely important, and not just for Austria, but for the entire European Union.
I always get somewhat confused when I hear people say “Russia and Europe,” because Russia (at least a large part of it) is, of course, part of Europe and not some “foreign element.” We all know well that we can achieve peace in Europe only together with Russia, and a number of regional and global problems can only be resolved with Russia’s involvement.
President Putin and I have discussed various foreign policy issues, such as developments in the “triangle” between the US, Iran and Europe, if you will. I will not take much of your time: President Putin is a much more interesting figure for you than I am.
I am pleased to welcome the entire high-level Russian delegation here in Vienna. Tonight we will perhaps meet once again at the Art History Museum where a very interesting exhibition, Old Masters from the Hermitage, featuring a number of exhibits provided by the Hermitage Museum, will open.
This means that President Putin is not our only guest tonight: the Hermitage will be here for several weeks and months on behalf of the entire Russian nation.
Thank you very much.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
First of all, I want to thank President Van der Bellen for the invitation to visit Austria.
The President expressed his determination to expand the entire scope of bilateral relations between Russia and Austria, which I fully support.
We have very good preconditions for that. Russia-Austria relations are based on a tradition of partnership and mutual benefit. We maintain regular contacts at the top level as well as between the ministries, agencies and parliaments of the two countries, between our businesses, representatives of culture, science, education and youth.
At a news conference with Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen.
Our mutual trade is growing. Russia-Austria trade turnover grew by 40.5 percent in 2017. The growth rate reached almost 100 percent in the first quarter of this year.
One of the key areas of our bilateral cooperation is energy. Our visit marks the 50th anniversary of the first contract to supply natural gas to Austria from the Soviet Union. Since then, we have exported over 200 billion cubic metres of natural gas to the Austrian market.
Austria has become one of the major – perhaps, one of the most important – transit hubs for Russian gas in Western Europe and plays an important role in ensuring the energy security of the entire European continent.
Overall, this anniversary symbolises the mutually beneficial and time-tested partnership which both our countries intend to continue strengthening.
Russia’s Austrian partners have supported our plans to increase gas supply to European consumers, including as part of Nord Stream 2 and other energy and infrastructure projects. We will by all means continue to discuss this important topic with the Federal Chancellor of Austria.
We discussed with Mr Van der Bellen cultural and humanitarian ties that have been rapidly developing in the past few years. We noted that holding cross events has become regular practice.
The Russia-Austria Year of Tourism was a success in 2017. In 2018 the Year of Music and Cultural Routes is being held. Cross years of youth exchanges, literature and theatre are planned for 2019 and 2020. As the President just said, today we will open the exhibition Old Masters from the Hermitage in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna.
The Federal President and I have agreed to facilitate the implementation of plans on creating a Russia-Austria public forum, the Sochi Dialogue.
We are satisfied with the joint work of Russian and Austrian historians. As members of the relevant Russia-Austria commission, they are making a tangible contribution to the unbiased study of our past and to resisting attempts to revise some complicated periods of European history.
I would like to express special gratitude to the government and people of Austria for the care they show for the burial sites of Soviet soldiers who liberated your country from Nazism.
Naturally, during the talks we exchanged views on a number of international and regional issues and talked about the developments in Ukraine and Syria.
News conference with Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen.
In conclusion, I would like to thank Federal President of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen for a constructive and productive meeting that, I am sure, will facilitate progress in the full range of bilateral ties.
We would be happy to see the President in Russia at any time at his convenience.
Thank you very much.
Question: A question for both presidents. It has been emphasised that Russia and Austria are long-time reliable partners, and large mutual investors. You just mentioned the numbers – many billions of dollars, and you talked about a number of projects. Taking into consideration the current international situation, do you think there is potential for further growth in our economic relations, and if so, which areas are most likely to see it?
Alexander Van der Bellen (retranslated): There is still quite a bit of potential. Russia is an immense market with 140 million people. And the way oil and energy prices are progressing, this is also a good benchmark.
In particular, I was impressed: after a setback, if I can put it this way, that trade and direct investment have again grown in the past two years. And the growth was noted in both countries, especially in direct investment.
Vladimir Putin: Indeed, our relations are progressing very well, steadily. In fact, Russia is the second largest investor in Austria, I think, after the Federal Republic of Germany. Russia has invested almost $25 billion in the Austrian economy. Our Austrian partners have invested almost four billion. Over 500 Austrian companies have a presence in the Russian market.
Mr President said that it is a large market with over 140 million people (146 million). But if we consider the Eurasian Economic Union, it has 170 million people, including Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. It is indeed a large, broad market, and a fast growing one at that. As I have said, our trade is growing at a very good rate.
I am not talking about energy. This is obvious. Thanks to cooperation with the Soviet Union and then with Russia, Austria has become the common European energy hub, which continues to develop very dynamically. In this sense, the role of the Austrian Republic in Europe’s energy industry is significant, large, and it will only increase.
At a news conference with Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen.
But we are not limiting ourselves to these areas. We have good prospects in engineering, timber processing, transport and logistics in general. We have adopted a plan on modernising the economy. This includes several fields (up to 20), some of them have already been completed, others are in progress, as they say, and are being implemented.
We have very good prospects. I am confident that they will be realised, and I would very much like to see our work provide an impetus to fulfilling these joint plans.
Question (retranslated): I have a question for Mr Putin.
Mr President, in your conversation with President Alexander Van der Bellen, and the forthcoming conversation with Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, would you like them to create a good atmosphere for lifting the EU sanctions?
Vladimir Putin: Sanctions, any politically motivated restrictions, protectionism – these are all the same thing. They are all ways of resolving political issues and are ultimately not effective at achieving the desired effect. They are harmful for everyone involved –those that initiate them, and those against whom they are used.
I can assure you that Russia has overcome the difficulties linked with these external restrictions. This was not easy for us a few years ago, because at that time we faced a considerable (double) reduction in the prices of our traditional exports. Nevertheless, we have not only preserved macroeconomic stability but also consolidated it.
As you may know, we reduced inflation to a record low in the history of modern Russia – 2.5 percent. We have a minimal unemployment rate – it has already dropped below 5 percent. Our gold and currency reserves are growing.
Our positive foreign trade balance is about $130 billion. Investment in basic capital is growing at the accelerated pace of 4.4 percent. We have reached economic growth – it is very modest so far, but stable.
This is why I say that sanctions are bad both for those that initiate them and those they are against. This is why I think everyone is interested in cancelling them. We are, too.
We realise full well that each EU country finds it difficult to talk about this on an individual basis. I will not talk about the reasons – you know them. But whatever is happening in this area does not prevent us from developing relations with the Republic of Austria. And we will do everything we can to continue developing them in the future and to carry out the plans I have talked about.
Question: My question is primarily for Mr Federal President of Austria concerning natural gas cooperation. Russia has been a reliable supplier of gas to Austria for 50 years. A new agreement is to be signed until 2040.
Meanwhile, Russia was often accused in the past years of using gas as a political weapon. I have the following question: has Austria experienced any external pressure in this area?
Alexander Van der Bellen: The fact is that not only Austria but the whole European Union has been importing gas from Russia and the former Soviet Union. Our experience has been very good.
Recently there has been, let us say, a reproach from some US politicians that EU dependence on Russia in this area is too great. Meanwhile, the fact that US liquefied natural gas is two or three times more expensive than Russian gas is overlooked.
Under such circumstances, there is little sense, from a purely economic view, to replace Russian gas with American LNG. And under such circumstances, I believe that future cooperation between Gazprom and OMV rests on a very solid foundation.
News conference with Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen.
Question (retranslated): I have a question to both presidents. There is a grave crisis between the EU and Russia, and there is an impression that Russia is facing the problem of trust. What are you going to do to overcome this? And what will Austria do to stop this problem, to get rid of it?
Vladimir Putin: You mentioned the problem of trust and said that Russia has it. I want to disappoint you: I do not think so. I do not think we have any problem with trust. It is a problem for those who want the situation in Russia to be like that.
We are open and ready to cooperation, we had until recently a whole set of mechanisms and tools of cooperation with Europe you referred to and with united Europe. We used to have dialogue in 20 different areas in the economy, and all that has been practically wrapped up now, and through no fault of ours.
We are not the initiators of curbing this interaction, and we are open and ready for joint work. Slowly, gradually this work is reviving, we can see that. We have consultations and dialogue with Brussels officials in a number of areas, and in my view they are proceeding very constructively, although not quite smoothly. But let me reiterate, not only Russia but also our European friends are interested in restoring full-scale work.
Alexander Van der Bellen (retranslated): I do not have anything to add to that. The issue of trust turns up in politics every now and again. Therefore, there is nothing unusual here; even my personality, in retrospect, may arouse a veracity issue.
I do not see any specific problem regarding Russia but I think it is a matter of correct interpretation of statements or actions. It is quite normal, business as usual, as they say. This is normal working mode. I do not see any crisis of confidence.

Meeting with Russian and Austrian business leaders
Vladimir Putin attended a meeting of the Russian-Austrian Business Council devoted to the 50th anniversary of gas supplies from Russia to Austria.

Meeting with Russian and Austrian business leaders.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal Chancellor told me before we came here that he would try to be concise so that I would have more time. I will use this generous offer, but I will try not to tire you too much.
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Federal Chancellor and the President of the Republic of Austria for inviting me here.
Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate you on the 50th anniversary of energy, gas cooperation between our countries.
The leading entrepreneurs, financiers and investors from Russia and Austria are attending this meeting. You share a desire to promote mutually beneficial economic cooperation, and you are implementing joint projects in widely different areas, as we have said more than once today.
Austria has always been a reliable partner of Russia. Our countries maintained close contacts for centuries, even in the most difficult periods in their history such as the Cold War.
It is noteworthy that Austria was the first Western country to sign a long-term agreement on Soviet gas deliveries to Europe 50 years ago, in June 1968.
Throughout the subsequent decades, we ensured reliable and uninterrupted energy supplies to Austria. We have delivered over 200 billion cubic metres of gas to our Austrian partners. Last year, Russian gas deliveries to Austria increased by 50 percent to more than 9 billion cubic metres.
Austria is one of the largest transit hubs in Europe, through which Russian gas is delivered to consumers in other European countries. Therefore, the energy security of the European continent is largely ensured by the close energy cooperation between our countries.
We are interested in deepening and expanding our close cooperation. A notable fact in this context is a new agreement on long-term Russian gas deliveries through 2040, which Gazprom and OMV have signed today.
Moreover, Gazprom and OMV are ready to jointly implement the project to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. It will reduce transit risks and deliver an additional 55 billion cubic metres of environmentally friendly and affordable fuel to the European economy.
Russian and Austrian businesses are actively interacting in other spheres as well. Last year, our bilateral trade increased by over 40 percent to reach $4 billion.
Russia is the second largest investor in the Austrian economy. Russian investment in Austria has reached nearly $24 billion, and Austrian investment in Russia is approaching $5 billion.
Over 1,200 Austrian companies are operating in Russia and there are some 500 Russian-Austrian joint ventures. Most of them are working in the real economy, or more precisely, in construction, industry and high technology.
We appreciate the active involvement of Austrian business in the recent St Petersburg International Economic Forum. The implementation of the bilateral commercial contracts that were signed during the Forum will create new companies and high-paying jobs both in Russia and in the Republic of Austria.
We certainly welcome and support such mutually beneficial projects. For our part, we will continue to do our best to ensure that international, including Austrian businesses feel comfortable in the Russian market.
We will continue our consistent efforts to liberalise business laws, reduce the administrative and tax burden on businesses and improve our financial and banking systems. We are resolved to modernise our infrastructure and social sectors.
I would like to point out the most positive trends in the Russian economy. Last year, our GDP growth was stable, if moderate, of 1.5 percent, and consumer demand increased by 3.4 percent.
Our industrial and agricultural sectors grew by 1.8 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. We are keeping inflation at a record low level of 2.5 percent. Unemployment has decreased to below 5 percent.
Our trade surplus is growing. It exceeded $130 billion in 2017, growing by 25 percent compared to the year before.
The floating ruble rate maintains the stability of the national currency. Russia is among the world’s leaders in terms of gold and currency reserves. Our sovereign debt is among the smallest in the world – below 20 percent.
Thanks to a responsible budgetary policy, we have reduced the federal budget deficit to 1.5 percent of the GDP and intend to report a budget surplus of 0.5 percent.
(Speaks in German, retranslated) Friends, our cooperation is very good indeed. But it can be much, much better. We can do it, we must do it, and we will do it, but this depends on you.
Thank you very much.
