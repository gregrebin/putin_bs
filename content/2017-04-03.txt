President of Russia Vladimir Putin: As you know, there has been an explosion on the St Petersburg metro. People have been killed and injured. I would like to express condolences and sympathy to the families of those killed and injured.
I have spoken with representatives of our security agencies and the FSB Director. Our law enforcement and security agencies are working to establish the causes of the explosion and to provide their assessment of the situation. The city authorities, and if needed, the federal authorities, will take the necessary measures to help the families of those affected by the blast.
The reasons behind it are not clear yet, and so it would be premature to speak about them. The investigation is ongoing. Of course, we always consider all scenarios, including accidental or criminal action, and above all, those of a terrorist nature. The ongoing investigation will soon provide answers regarding the causes of this tragedy.

Press statements following meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, colleagues,
We would like to brief you on the results of our work. And there are results. We have agreed that we shall settle all our contentious issues on oil and gas, actually, we did not agree, we settled them. We agreed on how and when we are going to do that. We shall do it within ten days.
We have found an arrangement whereby we maintain our approaches, harmonise our stances on prices. We have found an opportunity for mutual trade-offs, agreed on how we will operate in this area not just in 2017 but also in 2018 and 2019. We have reiterated our commitment to set up by July 2019 the necessary rules, foundational rules and conditions on creating a united market of electric power, general conditions and rules. We gave reiterated our readiness to do our best to draft joint rules for the united gas market by January 1, 2018, and by 2024 to draft and sign an intergovernmental agreement within the Eurasian Economic Union on a single gas market.
We spent a lot of time discussing cooperation in finance, in some particular areas of the economy, in high-tech areas, and finished with the possibility of expanding our joint work in space.
We spoke at length on cooperation in agriculture. I asked the Government of the Russian Federation for our specialists to go to Belarus this week and work with their colleagues at the enterprises that aroused suspicion regarding compliance with our phytosanitary standards.
I believe these are the issues that are being resolved in the course of our joint practical work in the spirit that has evolved between our countries over the many years since the signing of the agreement on the formation of the Union State.
Let me remind you that yesterday we marked the Day of Unity of the Peoples of Russia and Belarus, and this year we also mark the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations. So there are no outstanding issues as of today. We will move on, we will keep enhancing allied relations within the Union State and work on the legal framework, and on the development of the Eurasian Economic Union.
Thank you.
President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
: Mr Putin, friends,
Regrettably, I must begin with what we discussed at the beginning of our meeting, even if on a different note. I am truly grateful to you for agreeing to hold our talks despite this tragedy and for conducting them in a positive and orderly manner. As you have said, there are no unsettled matters between us now.
Of course, it is bad when presidents have to deal with issues they are not expected to address. Well, it comes with the job. Indeed, Mr Putin and I have settled all outstanding issues in the oil and gas sector, and so I will not speak about them now. We spent a long time discussing agrarian issues and have agreed that they will be tackled by the Union State Supreme State Council along with the issue of our industrial policy. We have agreed to coordinate the timeframe and to adopt decisions on these and other issues at a Supreme State Council meeting.
To tell the truth, we spent considerable time discussing international issues, especially those that concern us, our neighbours, and EU policy. We exchanged opinions on relations with the United States and ways to develop them. Of course, I asked Mr Putin not to forget about Belarus when building up relations with major powers. He will be meeting with the G20 leaders soon. He assured me of Russia’s support and promised to continue to support Belarus at all forums, just as he always did.
We also discussed security issues, and not only in connection with the tragedy in St Petersburg. We had planned to discuss them; these issues were on our agenda. We did not begin our discussion with oil and gas issues. As we had planned, we focused on our countries’ security. I will not provide any details, because you can see what is going on. We want to maintain stability in Russia and Belarus. There are too few peaceful regions in the world. We have agreed to work collectively to protect our security, the security of our countries.
Mr Putin, I am grateful to you for meeting us halfway on refinancing our debts to Russia this year. Mr President has promised to issue corresponding orders on this issue today or tomorrow.
I would like to reiterate that we have no unsettled issues now. Moreover, we looked into the future of our economies. We have settled these issues. I believe that in a matter of ten days, as Mr President said, our Governments will formalise our decisions to normalise work in our economies.
Once again, thank you, Mr Putin. I deeply regret that we have met in this difficult situation. But we must stand together, and our people must see this, as we have shown them today.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

With President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
After a one-on-one meeting, the talks continued with the involvement of the delegations. Later, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko made statements for the press.
The President of Belarus has come to Russia on a working visit.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, I am very glad to welcome you to St Petersburg. Yesterday we marked a common holiday, the Day of Unity of Peoples of Russia and Belarus.
However, I must begin our meeting on a different note. As you know, there has been an explosion on the St Petersburg metro. People have been killed and injured. I would like to begin our meeting by expressing condolences and sympathy to the families of those killed and injured.
I have spoken with representatives of our security agencies and the FSB Director. Our law enforcement and security agencies are working to establish the causes of the explosion and to provide their assessment of the situation. The city authorities, and if needed, the federal authorities, will take the necessary measures to help the families of those affected by the blast.
Regrettably, we are compelled to begin our meeting by speaking about this tragic event. The reasons behind it are not clear yet, and so it would be premature to speak about them. The investigation is ongoing. Of course, we always consider all scenarios, including accidental or criminal action, and above all, those of a terrorist nature. The ongoing investigation will soon provide answers regarding the causes of this tragedy.
As for our meeting, I would like to say that this year we will mark yet another important event, 25 years of diplomatic relations. Today we have an opportunity to speak about what has been done over this period to promote bilateral cooperation, what we need to do and the unresolved issues we need to address.
I am very glad to see you in Russia. I am grateful to you for accepting our invitation to come to St Petersburg to talk about these issues.
President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
You know my attitude towards St Petersburg, a city that is not foreign to me and that is your home city. It is always with great pleasure that I come here.
It is deeply, deeply regrettable that this has taken place. In times like these, you always pray to God that things will not get worse. Unfortunately, we have confronted similar problems in Minsk. I hope things will not get worse.
I would like to express my condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims, to the residents of St Petersburg, who react with such poignant sensitivity to such things, the way all Slavic people do.
I have just said to you that we will not be allowed to live in peace, and that we must be prepared for anything. There are very many challenges in the world. We do not live in an isolated world, as you and I know only too well, because we have held our offices for many years. This is why we need to speak very seriously, considering that security is a top item on our agenda today, the security of our Fatherland, if I may call it that, which I think is perfectly appropriate. We will talk about how to live in this world and how to protect the interests of our people.
As for problems in relations, they will always be there. However, in the face of events such as this, these problems pale in significance. We can deal with all our problems quickly and effectively. May God grant us peace, and allow us to continue to protect the security of our people.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Videoconference marking the start of drilling at the Tsentralno-Olginskaya well
Vladimir Putin, via videoconference, launched the start of drilling at the Tsentralno-Olginskaya-1 well on the Khatangsky block, the northernmost well on the Russian Arctic shelf.

Videoconference marking the start of drilling at the Tsentralno-Olginskaya well.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
(Addressing Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Rosneft Igor Sechin) Mr Sechin, I would like to wish success to you and all of your colleagues, the engineers, workers, and all the specialists actively launching this major project.
We spoke last week in Arkhangelsk about developing the Arctic’s mineral resources, and now, in the eastern Arctic, in the Laptev Sea, your big development and production project is beginning. True, production is still a long way off, but we are seeing the start of work to develop a whole oil and gas province, which preliminary data suggest contains a vast quantity of energy resources, millions of tonnes of oil and gas.
I know this work is difficult. You spoke about it when you briefed me in person recently. Horizontal drilling is a complex and high-tech operation. This is just the first well. There is much more work ahead. I would like to wish you good luck and I hope for this undertaking’s success.
You have the floor.
CEO and Chairman of the Board of Rosneft Igor Sechin
: Thank you very much.
Mr President, we are on the Khara-Tumus Peninsula in the Dolgano-Nenets District, above the 73rd parallel, 250 metres away from the Laptev Sea coast. It is 350 kilometres to the nearest town of Khatanga. Through the snowstorm behind me, you can glimpse the drill rig. Today, when you give the command, the company will start drilling the first exploratory well in the eastern Arctic, the Tsentralno-Olginskaya-1 well.
The preparation work for the start of drilling was completed within a very short time. As you recall, with your support, we gained the right to work on the Khatanga block just over a year ago. We carried out unprecedented geological exploration work within a very short period. We completed 21 linear kilometres of seismic studies that revealed the existence of 114 promising oil and gas-bearing structures, so-called ‘traps’. Preliminary estimates suggest that the Laptev Sea’s total potential geological resources could come to 9.5 billion tonnes of oil equivalent.
The logistics operation to prepare for today’s drilling took eight months. The considerable distance from the support base and the difficult climatic conditions complicated this work.
Reinforced polar-class vessels brought the drilling equipment, residential modules, and the necessary equipment and technology from Arkhangelsk, 3,600 kilometres away. This all came to 8,000 tonnes of materials.
The drilling will be done from the coast, as this makes it possible to considerably reduce the construction costs of this well. The design depth is up to 5,000 metres with a subsequent horizontal leg. The technology we have enables us to drill with a vertical deviation of up to 15,000 metres. This technology makes it possible to save money, ensures economic efficiency, and meets high environmental standards. Our company is one of the world leaders today in developing offshore fields.
As you may recall, Mr President, we started working in the Kara Sea in 2014, acting on your instructions, and discovered a very important field – the Kara oil and gas-bearing province. This year, after starting on the Khatanga block, we will be drilling in the Black Sea. Next year, we will drill in the Barents Sea, and in 2019, we will return to the Kara oil and gas field, and will continue our work in the eastern Arctic.
Mr President, as you noted at the conference in Arkhangelsk, work and investment in the Arctic have a seven-fold multiplier effect. This work involves close coordination with the energy sector, construction and transport, air and sea transport. Without your support, we would not have been able carry out the preparations for this drilling and begin today’s work.
We would like to thank you for your support and trust. Rosneft will always live up to your trust, Mr President.
This ends my report. Mr President, if you do not mind, I would like to play this short video about preparations for the drilling.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, please.
(Video is played)
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Igor Sechin: Mr President, I ask you to give the command to start drilling the first exploratory well in the eastern Arctic.
Vladimir Putin: Begin.
Igor Sechin: Drilling operator, begin drilling.
Reply: I copy that. Begin drilling.
We have begun.
Igor Sechin: Mr President, the drilling has begun. We will keep you updated on the work. Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Mr Sechin, I know that our oil sector in general and Rosneft in particular have always placed a lot of emphasis on environmental safety. I assume that in this case, especially in the Arctic, where the ecosystem is very vulnerable to outside interference, these principles and rules will be respected and you will give this aspect your utmost attention.
As we have said, we know that we have tremendous untapped offshore and coastal reserves in the Arctic. Given the tremendous value and importance of these reserves of hydrocarbons and other minerals, we have allowed only companies in which the state holds a majority stake to take part in this work. Licences have been accorded only to Rosneft and Gazprom. Rosneft should undoubtedly make the best possible use of these privileges.
I want to wish you all the very best.
Igor Sechin: Yes, sir, Mr President. Thank you very much.
