President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Borodavkin, you are off to Kazakhstan. It is not only our neighbour and ally, it is a country with which we share the deepest, multifaceted relations based on trust. This mission is not only a pleasant one but at the same time a very honourable and demanding post. I suggest we speak about it in detail.

I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate you on your election as Russian President and to assure you that Russian diplomats are on your team, and we will do anything we can to provide favourable conditions in order to implement the tasks you set – to make a breakthrough in the development of the country over the next few years.
I also very much appreciate and I am thankful for the trust you showed by appointing me the Russian Ambassador to Kazakhstan. I will do my best to meet your expectations. I understand the responsibility I am entrusted with.
As you said, Kazakhstan is our closest ally and strategic partner. We have a huge positive agenda: cooperation both in bilateral relations and in coordinating and joint work within the EAEU
, CSTO
, SCO
and CIS
.I fully understand that we will have a lot to do in the future.
