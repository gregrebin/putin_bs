President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
May 9 is nearing â€“ the most important and sacred holiday for our country, for every Russian family.
I am addressing all citizens of Russia.
We are marking the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory this year.
We began preparing for this major date in advance, at the federal level and in all regions. You know that, without exaggeration, the whole country participates in Victory Day celebrations.
On Victory Day, we honour and pay tribute to the heroes who defended our country and the whole world, and sacrificed their lives in order to save the lives of others. The winners, the veterans set the highest moral standard for us, and passed on to us their beliefs and faith. We must carefully preserve these values and bring up future generations on them.
To be continued.
