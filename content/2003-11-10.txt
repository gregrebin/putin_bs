Excerpts from the Opening Remarks at a Meeting with the Cabinet Members

Vladimir Putin: At the start of our meeting I would like to say a couple of words about the results of our work in Rome and Paris. A Russia-EU Summit has ended and we all agree – we have exchanged opinions with the Prime Minister – that the results are quite positive.
First, we have managed to agree on and sign a rather important document that outlines the perspective of the development of the relations between Russia and the European Union. I am referring to the agreement to create a common economic space with the EU. It lays down the principles of our cooperation. We have also agreed to create common spaces in the fields of education and science and in the humanitarian sphere. As you know, Russia has joined the Bologna process, which should eventually result in the mutual recognition of diplomas, something that is extremely important for young people because it expands the labour market. It is a very serious and substantial step to integrate Russia in the world.
We have discussed some specific projects. I would like to mention our cooperation in space. In Paris and Rome we agreed on practical steps to implement our joint plans to use Russian booster rockets for launches from the Kourou launching site as part of joint space exploration with the European Union. We are talking about civilian as well as military components, which is very important for us because it marks a quantum change in our relations with the European Union.
To sum up our work with our colleagues in Rome, I would like to mention another area of our cooperation – easing visa regulations. As you know we have signed corresponding bilateral documents with Italy and France to ease visa regulations for some categories of Russian citizens and the citizens of Italy and France. Earlier we signed a similar document with Germany.
The new regulations will apply above all to young people and businessmen, politicians, athletes, scientists and teachers.

Opening Remarks at a Meeting with Hassan Rohani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran
November 10, 2003
18:35
The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Mr Secretary of the Supreme Council, colleagues,
I am happy to welcome you here in Moscow. We highly value these direct contacts that have developed between the Russian and Iranian authorities. Iran is our neighbour – it is a good neighbour and our relations are developing in a positive way.
We both have common issues to discuss. I recall all our meetings with President Khatami, the meetings we had as part of the discussions on the Caspian, and also just recently in Malaysia.
Our economic ties are developing quite well and there are good prospects here. We have always cooperated actively with Iran in normalising the situation in the region. I would like to note the positive role Iran has played in resolving issues concerning Afghanistan and the high level of cooperation between Russia and Iran in this area. We are all very concerned by the overall situation in the Middle East. I think that today we will have an opportunity to exchange views with you on this subject. Finally, there is also the much discussed and sensitive subject of our nuclear cooperation and Iran’s nuclear programme. As a full participant in the international community, Iran has the right to develop its nuclear programmes in accordance with international rules and regulations.
We welcome the latest agreements reached between Iran and our European colleagues who recently visited Tehran – I am referring to the visit to Iran by the foreign ministers of four European countries.
We are very happy to see you here and we are sure that your visit will make a significant contribution to developing our bilateral relations.
