Meeting with Government members.
The meeting participants focused on improving the mechanisms for oversight and supervision activities. Deputy Prime Minister and Chief of the Government Staff Konstantin Chuychenko delivered a corresponding report.
The participants also discussed creating a special service, “a mirror of inspections register,” to receive online information from entrepreneurs on inspections with an eye towards further comparing them with the information in the Unified Register of Inspections. Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Prosecutor General Yury Chaika informed the participants about the results of the work on the website and its integration into the system for prosecutorial supervision of inspections.
In addition, Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov spoke about the results of the 2019 Digital Breakthrough national contest for IT professionals, designers and managers in the digital economy.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
The Digital Breakthrough contest ended, with the finals held on September 27–29. It was a very good event, and I want to congratulate everyone who participated in it and won, but for some reason 22 teams won at the same time.
Mr Akimov, please tell us about it.
Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov
: Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
Indeed, the final 48-hour hackathon, a big digital marathon which is recognised as one of world’s largest, brought together over 3,000 participants from 77 Russian regions. The competition was held in 20 main categories, two winners in two categories, as recognised by the jury, so there were 22 prizes.
Cash prizes totalled 500,000 rubles each. In addition to the main prize, the Innovation Support Fund selected, on a competitive basis, 112 young people during the first stage. They will receive grants to promote their projects and teams.
As you noted, one of this competition’s hallmarks is that it was focused on practical rather than theoretical problems, based on requests from the federal authorities or state-owned companies.
Despite the fact that the prizes have been presented to the winners, the bulk of the work based on the projects in the competition is still ahead. In conjunction with the autonomous non-profit organisation, Russia – Land of Opportunity, which hosted the competition, we outlined activities in three areas.
First is expediting projects, bringing them to the point where it is possible to secure funding from one of the development institutes so the process doesn’t stop at the competition and projects can remain active. As of today, 60 projects and teams have been selected for this programme. However, the second stage was announced. It will end on October 14, and 3,000 participants still have time to submit applications if they have not done so yet.
The second part of the efforts is, of course, to facilitate the implementation of the projects from the competition. We already have the first results. Thus, in the Housing, Utilities and Urban Environment category, the solution offered for service calls to order a repairman’s visit will be used in the Perm Territory. The governor showed a lot of interest in this.
In Transport and Logistics, mobile app prototypes for cashless payment of transport fees will be developed in Tomsk.
The solution on smart navigation for technical personnel on a production site was presented to Rosatom and will be implemented by them.
Rostelecom invited a team to develop a service on waste disposal.
Russian Railways will have a programme to audit the coverage areas along railways, based on data from subscriber devices.
There are many other interesting examples that concern the Federal Passenger Company and Rosstat (Federal Service for State Statistics).
The third part is certainly a search for employment opportunities for those who showed high personal competences. This is practically headhunting for the most talented. It was done while the competition was still on. Without even waiting for the results, Rosatom “purchased,” in the positive sense of the word, 72 specialists to detect faults in transport pipelines.
Approximately 15 participants in the hackathon are now being selected for jobs at Rostelecom. For instance, MTS, a private company, engaged four selected teams. This work will certainly continue. The main goal is to avoid losing energy and talent, and most importantly, the confidence that a project will find a specific application.
Mr President, in this context I would like to ask you to support the nearly unanimous desire of all the participants to hold the Digital Breakthrough competition under the aegis of the non-profit organisation Russia – Land of Opportunity in 2020.
This concludes my report. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: All right. I would like to congratulate both the participants and the winners once again.
