Russian President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
As agreed earlier, today we will discuss issues related to the development of the energy sector, including promising areas like the production of LNG – liquefied natural gas.
Before we start discussing issues on the agenda, I would like to congratulate all current and veteran workers of Russia’s oil and gas sector and the gas industry in general, on their professional holiday, which was marked yesterday, on September 3. I want to thank hundreds of thousands of people employed in this very important sector for their loyalty to the traditions of hard work, and their intense and effective work for the benefit of the whole country.
Your success, your significant achievements are making an enormous contribution to the development of the Russian economy and help ensure that large companies, small businesses and life support systems run smoothly, and that the needs of the domestic market are met reliably and in full.
Despite the blatantly hostile actions of some countries, illegitimate and endless restrictions and sanctions, the Russian energy sector, our oil and gas companies, in general, feel confident, are making good progress and are successfully handling the tasks set before them, including in foreign trade, finding new and reliable partners and remapping logistics routes.
Russia is implementing a range of major oil and gas exploration and processing projects that are crucial for the further development of the fuel and energy complex and many regions of the country. These projects include Vostok Oil, Yamal LNG, Arctic LNG 2, Amur Gas Processing Plant and Petrochemical Complex, and Sakhalin projects. New fields are being developed, such as the Kovyktinskoye deposit, which was launched in December 2022.
Our strategic oil and gas pipelines, including the Power of Siberia, ESPO and TurkStream, enjoy demand. I discussed this today with our colleagues from Turkiye. Given the good prospects for expanding cooperation with friendly countries, we are considering the possibility of speeding up the construction of the Far Eastern Route and the main gas pipeline Power of Siberia 2. A gas hub project in Turkiye is also being developed, and we discussed it with our colleagues today.
Overall, in the current challenging conditions, Russia has not only reaffirmed its energy self-sufficiency and independence, as well as resilience to external shocks, but also continues to hold key positions in the global energy sector. We are working confidently and self-sufficiently, without exaggeration.
At the same time, I want to emphasise that the main goal of the oil and gas industry, and the entire domestic energy sector, is to meet our country’s needs. This includes the interests of our economy and all Russian consumers, including entrepreneurs and businesses, as well as households. This task involves continuing the important gas infrastructure development programme, maintaining a balance between the efficiency of production, processing and retail sales, and ensuring the availability of corresponding products and services for industry and households while preventing significant price fluctuations.
These tasks need to be monitored at all times and addressed through dialogue with the business community.
Now, let us move on to the topic of our meeting today.
Let’s give the floor to NOVATEK CEO Leonid Mikhelson.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
Welcome to Russia and Sochi.
We agreed to hold this meeting long ago, but this is our first personal meeting since the elections in Turkiye. I have already had the pleasure of congratulating you on the election results, and I would like to do so again during our personal meeting, although several months have already passed.
We continue to maintain the momentum in promoting relations between Russia and Turkiye, facilitated by your direct involvement. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that last year our trade increased by over 80 percent – by 86 percent, I think. This positive trend spilled over into the first half of this year, even if it has not been as massive as last year. But there is still positive momentum.
Our relations are becoming increasingly diverse and not only within the sectors where we have been working together for quite a while, such as agriculture and energy, but also in other areas, which makes me happy.
We have made headway, and I hope that we will complete our talks on establishing a gas hub in Turkiye in the near future, so as to make the energy situation in the region more stable and well-balanced. I believe that this will prove beneficial.
As I have already said, we have expanded opportunities for delivering agricultural produce from Turkiye’s farmers to the Russian market. This volume is very impressive and continues to grow.
We continue to expand our relations in the iron and steel industry, and these relations have very good prospects all the same. As I have said, we are moving very confidently in the sphere of energy. The main suppliers and consumers on both sides have reached agreements, and I hope that this trend will continue, and that we will witness this in the near future.
We continue to build the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant. Today, Turkiye has become a member of the international club of nuclear states, following the delivery of the first batch of Russian nuclear fuel to Akkuyu. We will launch the first power unit next year, all goes according to plan. There are some interesting options for continuing our cooperation here. Today, a very large team of skilled specialists (nearly 25,000 people) continues to work at the NPP.
We have a lot to discuss in the context of maintaining regional security. Of course, we will not overlook issues linked with the Ukraine crisis. I know that you intend to raise questions about the grain deal. We are open to talks on this issue.
Of course, you and I have accomplished a lot for the situation in Syria. I know that the Republic of Turkiye perceives this as a highly sensitive issue; you and I are in the know. To my mind, we should formalise the most important achievements within the framework of the Astana format, and the platform itself, too.
Of course, there are other countries in the region, I mean the Libyan issue. There are many other bilateral and international issues, and we will certainly focus on them today.
Thank you very much for accepting our invitation and for arriving in Sochi today.
President of the Republic of Turkiye Recep Tayyip Erdogan
(retranslated): Mr President,
First of all, I want to note that this invitation marks a different stage in relations between Russia and Turkiye. This visit is taking place against the backdrop of a war between Ukraine and Russia and the situation that is taking shape in this regard. And your invitation… we are glad to be invited and my delegation is glad to be invited.
Our relations, relations between Turkiye and Russia, especially in terms of foreign trade turnover [are making good headway]: it has reached 62 billion US dollars. We have set the task of bringing foreign trade turnover to 100 billion US dollars, and this makes us happy.
Today, the heads of the central banks [of Turkiye and Russia] are present here and they will hold a separate meeting. This will be an important step forward in trade relations between our countries, a step towards trade in national currencies.
As for the Akkuyu NPP, the developments there are quite positive. The work is still in progress. As you said, the project employs a workforce of nearly 25,000. The developments regarding the first power unit are very good, as we said before. As for a nuclear power plant in the city of Sinop, I think we will take another step in this direction and build a new plant in that city. Creating a gas hub in the Thrace region will make our relations even richer in content.
On the other hand, the tourism industry is yet another important aspect of relations between Turkiye and Russia. Today, Russians outnumber all other guests coming to our country as tourists.
At the same time, I want to note that the most important step… We can say that the world’s attention is on the grain deal. The world public wants to know what will come out of it and what the result will be. I think and I believe that after our contacts and during our news conference we will send the necessary message to the world, especially to the least developed African countries. A step in this direction will be of much importance.
The military and defence industry and the energy sector are two other crucial areas. We have made steps, particularly with regard to natural gas. It is of paramount importance for us that we have good relations with Russia in this field. I think that we will promote our gas-related arrangements.
I also want to note the following: the summer season and forest fires… It is common knowledge that you sent two aircraft to fight wildfires. They did help us a lot. But could we please increase the number of aircraft by at least two, because the danger is still there and the fires pose a great threat? These aircraft are very useful in the context of our efforts to extinguish fires.
I want to thank you again on behalf of my new cabinet ministers. I hope that our meeting and contacts will be of use for our countries and regions.
Thank you very much for the attention.
Following the talks in expanded format with the participation of delegations, the conversation continued one-on-one, in a working breakfast format.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, you mentioned the effort to fight forest fires.
I want to say that after the terrible earthquake that hit Turkiye, we were among the first to lend a hand to the Turkish people and help ordinary people and the [quake] victims. The same refers to fighting wildfires.
All of this goes to say that you and I have brought Russian-Turkish relations to a very high level, and this is influencing all areas of our collaboration.
I suggest that we work in the following way. First, we will give the floor to the co-chairs of the Intergovernmental Commission, who will provide a general overview of what is going on in our relations, primarily in trade and the economy. Next, possibly, [we will ask] the foreign ministers [to speak].
