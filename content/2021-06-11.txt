President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today we will discuss what needs to be done to ensure security and create the necessary conditions for the free expression of will by our citizens on the single voting day next September.
This is a large package of issues to discuss: how to help people in September and how to assist election commissions and their members to organise their work properly. This is an extremely important event in the nation’s political life.
