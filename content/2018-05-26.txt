At the meeting with the new Government of the Russian Federation.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Allow me to once again congratulate you on your appointment to top government positions and wish you success in the forthcoming work. You have joined the Russian Government, which faces not only complicated but also extremely responsible tasks.
These are targets of a new level. The viability of our nation, the energy of its progress, its future – I am not exaggerating – depend on achieving them.
I am confident that you are fully aware of the scale and content of these breakthrough tasks, that each of you, the ministries’ teams that are being formed, and the Government as a whole will work dynamically, meticulously, closely together, and with the utmost dedication.
The Government must promptly draft and approve the main guidelines for its activities and key projects in accordance with the May 2018 Executive Order On National Goals and Strategic Objectives of the Russian Federation through to 2014. These goals and tasks, their concrete targets, as you saw for yourselves, require a similarly clear and understandable mechanism for their implementation, including the provision of resources.
This large, fundamental volume of work must be completed by October 1, 2018. I discussed this with Mr Medvedev a number of times recently.
Let me stress that this stage will directly impact how successful and fruitful our further progress will be. So there can be no excuses that some kind of circumstances prevented you from doing this work with high quality, at the due level and on schedule.
You must show initiative, find unconventional approaches, and establish a modern governance style. Key issues of Russia’s breakthrough development will be resolved here, in the Government; measures will be taken that the time and our strategic goals demand.
It is the place for the “engine,” the driver for innovation and change in all areas of our life, and the whole nation should feel the beat, the energy of your work.
It is absolutely crucial to ensure proper coordination with regional management teams. I ask you to constantly pay close attention to that since we know perfectly well that all our plans will be materialised in the regions.
You must also show an example of constructive cooperation with civil society entities, political parties, including the Russian Popular Front as one of the largest public organisations. Its activists have a great deal of experience in monitoring the execution of the May 2012 Executive Orders. I am confident that such practice of civil, public monitoring and control should go on.
The Government and the ministries must be committed to maximum openness and an ongoing dialogue with the public. You must explain all your actions. This will largely contribute to the success of the Government.
We must engage more citizens in the implementation of development tasks, encourage their drive to attain the goals we need. In a word, you have big, substantial and very interesting work ahead.
I wish you strength, energy and the best of health – so that there is enough of it for this large-scale work – and success.

At a reception in the Bolshoi Theatre to mark the opening of the Cross Years of Russia and Japan.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
I am delighted that we have opened the cross Year of Japan in Russia and Russia in Japan. I hope you liked the Japanese traditional ceremony of Kagami Biraki performed by Budokan Karate masters and the drum and dance ensemble Drum Tao.
I believe that all of this suits the occasion very well as a demonstration of the synthesis of Japanese traditions and modern reality, as well as a combination of the creative ideas of Japanese and Russian masters of arts, Budokan Karate masters, musicians, performers and dancers of the wonderful school of Russian ballet.
Ladies and gentlemen, the cross-year has barely begun. Lying in store for us are many interesting and impressive events, such as Kabuki performances, art exhibits and the traditional Japanese art of mounted archery – Yabusame, which the Russian public will see for the first time.
Japanese festivals will be held in many Russian cities. We also plan to hold political, economic and research events and youth, sports and interregional exchanges. Over 300 such events have been planned, and many more will be added to the agenda. I invite you to visit them and discover the unexplored elements of Japan.
We will not limit our contacts to the framework of the cross-year. Thanks to simplified visa requirements, the number of Russian citizens who visited Japan last year increased by 40 percent compared to the year before.
We will try to make the best use possible of the opportunities offered by the cross-year and the 2018 FIFA World Cup to make a breakthrough in humanitarian ties between our peoples.
Today we have invited to our reception famous politicians, economists and those working in the sciences and the arts, making a great contribution to Russian-Japanese relations. I would like to use this opportunity to thank all of them and to ask them to continue to assist us in this undertaking.
Thank you.
(Speaking in Russian) Spasibo.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends,
People in Russia have always had a great interest in Japanese history, culture and traditions. We have watched respectfully Japan’s progress and the impressive examples of Japanese talent.
I know the Japanese people look forward to and admire performances by Russian artists. My friends from the leading Russian orchestras and theatres have told me about this. What does this mean? It is evidence of mutual attraction and sympathy between the people of Russia and Japan.
We are living in a complex and rapidly changing world. Partner relations between Russia and Japan are what we need, what Russia and its friends in neighbouring Japan need.
We are grateful to Mr Prime Minister for the attention he pays to the development of Russian-Japanese ties and for his idea of holding a Year of Japan in Russia and a Year of Russia in Japan, which will allow us to learn more about each other and will bring us closer together.
I would like to thank everyone who is participating and will participate in these events and wish success to everyone.
(Speaking in Japanese) Arigato.

Beginning of meeting with Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, dear Shinzo, colleagues,
Let me greet you again, this time in Moscow, in the Kremlin.
We are very happy to be able to continue a dialogue with you which was launched yesterday, and to talk in greater detail about our bilateral relations.
Yesterday we had an opportunity to talk about the development of trade and economic relations, both with business leaders and with you and your colleagues. We noted growth both in trade and in investment, but the key is the interest of both parties in advancing our relations. We can come back to some of these issues and discuss political collaboration.
Today we will give a start to a series of events at the Bolshoi Theatre that will entail over 400 different events in the humanitarian sphere and culture.
I am very pleased to have this opportunity.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): President Putin, I would like to congratulate you on your overwhelming victory in the presidential election.
I recall that during our previous meeting in Danang Mr President expressed a hope that the results of the general election in Japan will help up realise all our plans. Indeed, I am now ready to steadily and energetically move our cooperation forward.
In Nagato we expressed our sincere resolve to settle the peace treaty problem. Our countries have started new relations since. We made advances in concrete joint economic projects on the four islands and in implementing humanitarian measures for their former residents. I expect to see a further boost to such efforts, including by using this meeting with you.
Yesterday I attended the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. It was the first time a Japanese Prime Minister took part in the event. I was there with many Japanese business leaders and tonight Vladimir Putin and I will take part in the opening of the Japan-Russia cross years.
The FIFA World Cup kicks off in Russia next month with Japan’s team among the competitors. Many football fans are looking forward to the event.
I hope that this year mutual understanding between the people of our two countries will deepen.

Video linkup with International Space Station
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
I am happy to greet the commander of the International Space Station crew, Russian citizen Anton Shkaplerov and onboard engineer, Japanese citizen Norishige Kanai.
I want to stress that this is far from being the first joint flight. We have been cooperating with Japan in this sphere for over a decade. Greetings to you! There have already been seven Japanese researchers in orbit. We want to wish you good luck.
Japan makes a considerable contribution to the work of the International Space Station. It is not just Japanese researchers who work in space. There is also a large amount of equipment and research conducted by Japanese specialists.
We wish you good luck!
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated):First of all, let me express to both cosmonauts my sincere joy that you, citizens of two countries, cosmonauts, are working jointly in space.
As President Putin said, our countries’ cooperation in space has been ongoing for a long time and will continue.
You have two flags behind you – a Russian and a Japanese flag, and we have just had talks with President Putin. We have agreed to make further efforts to develop cooperation between our countries.
 I would like to use the opportunity to wish both cosmonauts to combine your efforts for future progress of space technologies.

Opening of Cross Years of Russia and Japan
Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe attended the opening ceremony of the Cross Years of Russia and Japan following their talks at the Kremlin.
May 26, 2018

Moscow
The Cross Years of Russia and Japan is a package of events in politics, the economy, science, culture and art, as well as in the sphere of student exchanges. The Cross Years aim to strengthen mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries and developing good-neighbourly ties in the long-term.
***
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
My congratulations on the opening of the Year of Russia in Japan and the Year of Japan in Russia. This is a remarkable and significant event for our countries and peoples.
The Russian-Japanese Cross Years are being held for the first time. They were initiated by our Japanese colleagues, and we supported this initiative, of course.
Russian Government ministries, public, political, and business circles in cooperation with partners from Japan, made every effort to translate the idea of holding the Year of Russia in Japan and the Year of Japan in Russia into action.
The program of the Cross Years is rather busy and includes numerous events that reflect the rich history, culture and authentic traditions of the people of Russia and Japan, as well as the modern life of our countries and their achievements in their economies, science, education, healthcare, and sports.
I am confident that the Cross Years will activate cooperation in various spheres and develop direct friendly contacts between people, and will raise the level of mutual trust between our nations as well as strengthen the basis of bilateral interaction.
The plans include business forums, conferences and seminars, where entrepreneurs and financial experts will address the issues of expanding industrial cooperation and discus joint projects.
Many events will take place in the Russian Far East, and this is only natural. Japanese investors have long and successfully worked there, taking part in high-tech projects implemented in areas of priority development. Of course, this positive experience should be encouraged and expanded to other regions of our country.
We currently devote much attention to developing closer interaction between representatives of expert and non-governmental organisations and the scientific and artistic communities. The programme of the Years includes numerous contacts between members of parliaments and scientific, student and youth exchanges.
We know that the Japanese traditionally show a sincere interest in our culture, art, theatre, music, cinema and literature, and the Year of Russia in Japan will feature many tours by renowned theatres and music collectives and will include various art and photo exhibitions, as well as the Week of Russian Cinema.
In conclusion, I will note once more that the implementation of this unique project of the Cross Years will further facilitate good-neighbourly relations and the partnership between Russia and Japan. Let me cordially wish every success in this large event.
Thank you for your attention.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
Last June, when young leaves were just turning in Tokyo, I spent unforgettable hours attending the opening ceremony of the Russian Seasons and watching the Bolshoi Theatre company's production of the ballet Giselle.
A year has passed since then. And now, in the building of this very theatre, we are celebrating the official opening of the Year of Russia in Japan and the Year of Japan in Russia. At President Putin's initiative, Japan became the first country where the Russian Seasons took place. The contacts that originated back then will this year be extended to political and economic spheres, as well as to youth and sports exchanges.
Japan and Russia, although neighbours, are considered countries that are close but at the same time distant from one another. Japan-Russia relations have much potential, which is being gradually realised.
Citizens of the two countries communicate with each other in various spheres and understand each other. This considerably reduces the distance between our countries and gives rise to great trust and friendship. The current Cross Year is leading us to a better tomorrow.
I hope you will watch and enjoy the performances by Japanese Kabuki theatre that will be showcased as pert of the Year of Japan. The programme will also feature an extensive art exhibition, with pieces that are rarely exhibited even in Japan.
Events aimed at promoting Japanese traditions and pop culture will take place in various parts of Russia's vast territory. I hope you will attend them too. And I am sure that people in Japan will be fascinated by the profound Russian art.
On June 14, the World Cup will start, with the Japanese national team having qualified and taking part. It is quite possible that Japan could even face Russia in the finals; I am already looking forward to such an interesting match.
Now you will see the Kagami Biraki ceremony performed by samurais wearing traditional armour, and a captivating show by Japanese drummers. Russian martial artists and Bolshoi Theatre performers will also take part in these shows.
This is a special programme that can only be seen tonight. I hope you immensely enjoy watching how the souls of Japan and Russia will sing in unison.
Thank you very much.

Press statements following Russian-Japanese talks
Following Russian-Japanese talks, Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe made statements for the press.

The Kremlin, Moscow
Following Russian-Japanese talks, Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe made statements for the press.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, dear Shinzo, ladies and gentlemen,
The talks with the Prime Minister of Japan were, as usual, of a business-like, constructive nature. We had a substantial discussion on the current state and prospects of Russian-Japanese relations, and exchanged opinions on a number of international problems.
As you know, yesterday we both took part in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and also had a meeting with our countries’ business leaders. And later today we will be at the Bolshoi Theatre to open the Year of Russia in Japan and the Year of Japan in the Russian Federation.
I would like to state with satisfaction that there is steady progress in Russian-Japanese cooperation. Constant political dialogue is ongoing between our countries, ministries and agencies are interacting, and inter-parliamentary and inter-regional relations are developing.
We have good results in the economy, too. Last year bilateral trade grew by 14 percent to exceed $18 billion. The volume of Japan’s investments in Russia is also growing. The Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation are closely collaborating. They established the Russia-Japan Investment Fund, which renders practical assistance to both countries’ companies in attracting credit resources for promising joint projects.
I must stress that our Japanese partners work in many different industries and in agriculture. About 100 projects are underway within the framework of the plan proposed by Prime Minister Abe in eight fields, as well as within the Russian list of priority investment projects.
Energy is one of the key areas. Russia provides Japan with about 10 percent of natural gas consumed by the country. In turn, Japanese companies take part in natural gas extraction and processing at the Yamal LNG, Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 facilities.
Following Russian-Japanese talks, Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe made statements for the press.
Speaking about cooperation in science and education, I would like to note that our countries’ scientists are currently engaged in over 100 joint projects. These include research in plasma physics, peaceful atom, ecology, seismology and space exploration.
I should also note the dynamically unfolding humanitarian relations, which include the 2017 Russian Seasons in Japan, the 12th Russian Culture Festival, and, of course, the cross years of Russia and Japan to be opened today.
During the talks we discussed issues related to the peace treaty. We feel it important to continue a patient search for a solution which would meet the strategic interests of both Russia and Japan and would be acceptable for the people of both countries.
We have reviewed in this context the implementation of the agreements on joint economic activities in the southern Kuril Islands. We are satisfied with the state of dialogue in five previously approved fields – aquaculture, greenhouse farming, package tours, wind farming and waste processing.
We also supported a proposal on sending the third Japanese business mission to the islands in the second half of the year. We will keep addressing problems related to the humanitarian part of the matter, and we will assist Japanese citizens in visiting the islands.
A special focus was given to the situation around the Korean Peninsula when discussing current international problems. We reiterated our interest in preserving the atmosphere of peace in that region.
We believe that the process participants should show restraint, avoid a new cycle of confrontation and hold the situation within the political and diplomatic field.
To conclude, I would like to thank Mr Prime Minister of open, frank and very useful talks.
Thank you for your attention.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): Once again, I have managed to come to Moscow. It is flooded in greenery. Yesterday I was in President Putin’s hometown and became the first Japanese Prime Minister to take part in the St Petersburg Economic Forum. It is a great honour for me. The White Nights gala was captivating. I am very grateful for the warm reception.
This is a special year for Japan-Russia relations. Today, at the Bolshoi Theatre, we will launch the Russia-Japan cross years together with President Putin. Russia will soon welcome the World Cup, which will bring with it many Japanese fans. It will bolster trust and friendship between our two peoples. This gives me great joy.
Russia has rich natural resources, a market with a population of 140 million and outstanding talent. Japan has its own advantages that can be matched with Russia’s. The flowers of our cooperation are blossoming one after another. Two years have passed since I put forward an 8-poin plan of cooperation in medicine, urban environment, energy and other areas.
Projects that are beneficial for the residents are taking shape. The policy to boost the citizens’ quality of life, declared by President Putin, is coherent with the 8-point cooperation plan. Let us now begin intensive cooperation in the economy digitalization and labour productivity improvement.
It was eighteen months ago in Nagato (I recall it was snowing) when Mr Putin and I met eye to eye, after which we announced our sincere commitment to resolving the issue of the peace treaty, giving a start to efforts in new areas.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe.
One of these areas is shared economic activity on the four islands. Both Japanese and Russian citizens will be able to reap the fruit of their joint work there. Then people will understand that cooperation brings big results of mutual benefit. It is then that we will be able to find a solution that would accommodate both countries.
Today we have agreed to step up the implementation of joint projects in five areas: aquaculture, hothouse vegetable farming, organizing wonderful nature trips, wind energy and waste recycling. In this context, we have agreed to send a business mission comprising project participants to the islands possibly in July or August.
To streamline joint activity, let us set up conditions that would allow people to act more freely. We will step up the discussion of this issue.
We took an important decision in Nagato, to meet the hopes and wishes of the former residents of the islands. Last year, for the first time, they were transported to the islands by air to visit the burial sites of their forebears.
I would like to once again express my gratitude to Russia for facilitating this. We have reaffirmed our readiness to provide air transportation to burial sites in July this year. We will urgently decide on the schedule.
Despite the difficult issues we face, we must begin with the fact that our plan can be implemented without prejudice to the legal positions of both parties. The first step will definitely open up new avenues. Our building on mutual trust is what will bear fruit.
As I have already mentioned, in my hometown of Nagato Mr Putin and I announced our sincere aspiration toward a peace treaty. It is this will, our will, our strength of will that can open a new way for the relations between Russia and Japan. For that reason, we have reaffirmed our commitment to advancing toward a peace treaty in a consistent way and using a new approach.
Japan and Russia are called upon to deepen cooperation and build trust-based bilateral relations characteristic of true friends. Let us further promote ideology, and expand it to security. We are planning on holding the third 2+2 meeting in the second half of 2018.
We will be expanding concrete cooperation in combating terrorism, drug trafficking and money laundering, or unorthodox threats.
We have had an in-depth discussion on the situation in North Korea, which has now shown new development. In keeping with the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, we must reach a comprehensive solution to the nuclear missile issues, abductions, turn the page on the unhappy past and seek to normalise relations. I am certain that Mr Putin understands this consistent policy of our country.
It is of special importance that Korea achieve verified and irreversible denuclearization in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution. Japan and Russia will maintain close dialogue to make sure that North Korea steers on the right path.
President Putin told me during our meeting in Vietnam in November last year that we could now hope for the implementation of all our plans. I want to say the same to the President-elect today.
The issue of the peace treaty that has not been signed for 70 years is not an easy one to address, but we want to put an end to it during the lifetime of this generation. It is the principal task of our plan.
We have had our 21st meeting with Mr Putin, and have built a trust-based relationship. As Mr Putin has already said, today we have been able to have a frank exchange of views. It is with respect and patience that I am looking forward to our next meeting in Vladivostok in September.
Thank you very much!
