Prime Minister of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu (retranslated): Mr President, I want to once again extend my welcome. I am very happy that we have the opportunity to meet.
Our relations have gained new momentum since the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council was created. We have established a good tradition and today’s meeting was already our fifth. I hope that after today’s meeting, we will continue our work at an accelerated rate.
Russian-Turkish relations are historical and strategic. In the future, they will become an example for others. Again, I welcome you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I fully agree with your assessments. We are in the same region, we are neighbours.
Indeed, as we already said at the news conference, our assessments of certain situations in the world do not always align, but our mutual interests are so deep that they do not leave us any other opportunity than to broaden our cooperation. And this will surely be a very powerful factor in our mutual development.
Thanks to your efforts as Foreign Minister, thanks to the efforts of the current President and the former Prime Minister, a great deal has been done to create the necessary atmosphere for cooperation.
