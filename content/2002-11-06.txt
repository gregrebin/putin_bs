Vladimir Putin: Just over a week ago we all lived through a terrible tragedy: it was a gruelling experience for the entire country. But those who faced the militants’ rifles fared the worst. I must say we came out of that situation at the cost of a terrible tragedy, with heavy and irreplaceable losses. If it had not been for the courageous and very dignified behaviour of those people who had the worst of it, those in the audience, if it had not been for your self-control and discipline, the consequences might have been far worse. They would have been far more tragic. Therefore I want above all to address words of sincere and deep gratitude to those of you who were in the audience among the hostages and through you to all the people who were there. That is the first point.
The second point. I know that you have a desire to take up professional matters directly and I think it is very correct. I am ready to discuss that with you from any angle.
