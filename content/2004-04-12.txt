Moscow, Federal Space Agency
President Vladimir Putin:
Dear colleagues,
Allow me once again to congratulate those of you who received awards. In conclusion, I would like to say the following: of course, we aspire and will continue to aspire to ensure that the space sphere ceases to be a field or area for military and political confrontation, which I already talked about when I made my short opening address just now.
But we all understand that this situation still exists, and will continue this way for quite some time. And we, of course, keep this in mind, and should remember it in future. This is the first point.
Secondly: of course, our economy was – and in fact we still can’t say that all problems have been completely solved – in a very difficult situation. Changes took place in the awareness and technology of our economic existence. This could not but affect such important components as space activity. Priorities changed in the awareness of society, and in the awareness of state figures. Many people thought that this was not that necessary or important. I didn’t mention the last public opinion by accident: 81% of Russian citizens now actively support the state’s efforts on developing space activity. And this is very important. Because in a democratic society, we cannot act contrary to public opinion. If we understand how important this is, we simply need to explain to society the essence and meaning of space activity.
But today, I repeat, not everything happens the way we would like, including in the economy, even though there are positive changes. Of course, there is never enough money, even for the most important thinks. But I would like you to know: the leadership of the country understand full well that space activity is one of the most important areas. This understanding does of course exist.
There is never enough money, and sometimes it is difficult to spend money effectively. I call on the leadership of the industry to treat these issues and problems very carefully, very seriously. But I would like to make one thing particularly clear: an understanding that space activity, and the sphere which you work in, is extremely important for the country – and not just because it solves ecological and agricultural problems, but problems that are vital for the country’s very existence – this understanding does exist. And we will work together going from this understanding.
I wish you all the best.
Happy Cosmonautics Day!
