Speech at the Meeting on Developing Nuclear Energy

The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: In 2006 around 16 percent of the electricity we produce will come from nuclear power stations, is that right? But if this industry continues working under the same conditions that it operates today, then in a few years nuclear energy will only constitute 13 percent of the total amount of energy produced in the country. However, our task is not just to stay at 16 percent but to increase that number. In any case, we must attain the level of some European countries, where nuclear energy amounts to 20 percent and more.
Let us listen to Sergei Vladilenovich Kirienko's [head of the Federal Atomic Energy Agency] report and address this topic as we continue discussing the issues connected with the general energy situation in the country, just as we did three weeks ago.
