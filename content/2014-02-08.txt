President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. I am very pleased to see you.
We had the opportunity to speak briefly yesterday, and not only about the event that has brought us together. By the way, I wanted to thank you for taking the time to attend the opening of the Olympic Games. But yesterday we already had an opportunity to start our discussion regarding regional issues and bilateral relations.
Russia remains Kyrgyzstan's main trade partner. Moreover, trade between our countries is expanding: it has grown by almost 18%, which is a very good sign. We must work to preserve this trend.
I appreciate this opportunity to speak with you in detail on all aspects of our cooperation. Welcome!
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Thank you! I am very glad to meet with you here.
First, I want to congratulate you on the opening of the Olympics yesterday. It was a spectacular show that left a deep impression on me. I am sure the memory of this event will stay with me forever.
Naturally, I welcome this opportunity to discuss any issues that we need to examine and resolve .
In addition to being a major partner in trade and the economy, the Russian Federation is indeed our main strategic partner, as you suggested.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
