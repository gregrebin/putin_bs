Speech at International Forum of Technological Development Technoprom-2018
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
I am delighted to welcome you to Technoprom-2018 International Forum of Technological Development. As usual, it takes place here in Novosibirsk, one of Russia’s key business, industrial and intellectual centres.
This region is home to major high-technology companies, as well as research and educational institutions. It is here that the world-famous Novosibirsk Academic City is located with all its potential to promote innovation.
We have toured the exhibition that is taking place as part of the forum, where we have seen some of the solutions developed with the help of researchers from the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Let me point out that this exhibition presents very interesting and promising Russian projects in a variety of fields, from nanomaterial to medical and aerospace technology.

I hope that by bringing together government officials, research and business communities, as well as development institutions, this forum will help these projects find the support they need for their future development.
Amidst today’s fast technology changes and global competition for scientific and industrial superiority, events like Technoprom are, undoubtedly, popular as well as extremely important.
There is no need to say this in front of this audience, however, I would like to say that today it is the knowledge and high technology that determine efficiency of the economy and allow us to drastically improve the quality of life, modernise the infrastructure and public administration, ensure security, law and order.
In fact, the advanced technology, its efficient development and, most importantly, fast implementation are what makes peoples, entire societies and nations viable and the countries’ positions– especially such big countries as Russia – strong in the world.
Therefore, the science and technology breakthrough is among our key national goals and priorities. I believe that we can achieve this breakthrough by uniting the efforts of the state, the business, scientific and educational community, and by giving more freedom to the initiative and creativity of our people.
Over the past years, we have systematically increased funding for science and upgraded the infrastructure for research and development. We built a comfortable environment for launching science-intensive production.
Over the past 17 years, the funding of science in real terms has increased 3.7 times. It is significantly more according to current prices, 23.6 times.
Of course, if we now talk to many of the people present here, they will say that this is not enough, and I agree: this is not enough. But we proceed from our capacities, although, of course, we will move on in this direction.
We created conditions for attracting talented and skilled young people to science. I would like to stress once again that young people are motivated by solving ambitious and important tasks. They need opportunities for personal fulfilment and achieving high scientific goals. We must do all we can to help them feel important.
At the same time, it is necessary – and we will do this – to promote our science among scientists from around the world and form ‘points of attraction’ for them. And I assure you there are such points.
When I visit some research centres I see our colleagues from many countries around the world working there. When asked why Russia, I hear a very pleasant answer. They say there is room for collaboration; there are appealing fields of research and prospective developments in which our experts have progressed and often progressed further than their colleagues elsewhere. Good working conditions have been created here.
Another important objective for us is to acquire new competences through international cooperation. This is what the development of state-of-the-art megascience-class facilities is all about.
Researchers could use them to resolve the so-called Grand Challenges, such as the depletion of resources, food shortages, as well as environmental matters, by creating new types of energy, materials, medicines and quality products. These spheres are represented at this exhibition.
We intend to create a network of these facilities, from Protvino in the Moscow Region to Novosibirsk Academic City (Akademgorodok) and Russky Island in Vladivostok. These facilities are designed to promote spatial development in Russia and pave the way to the emergence of territories with a high concentration of research and development. The Novosibirsk Akademgorodok must be among those that lead the pack. In fact, it is already among the leaders, and we will do everything to support it moving forward.
Instructions to this effect were issued earlier this year, and our colleagues have just reported on their implementation. I hope that all our plans will be carried out on time and will be up to the mark. I can also say that regional authorities and the academic community have done a great deal to lay the groundwork for the implementation of these plans.
At the same time, this project is still in the making and being worked out. In fact, this is the first time that we are openly discussing it. I look forward to your constructive comments and proposals.
Let me emphasise that creating new, competitive manufacturing facilities, including those focusing on exports, is one of the priorities for Akademgorodok. Russian businesses are expected to contribute proactively to these undertakings.
I have to say that businesses focusing on high technology are developing at a respectable rate, showing very good results.
I was informed that streamlining mechanisms for finding real-life applications for research results is another highlight on the forum’s agenda. This is one of the areas where we have always faced many problems.
Let me reiterate that the whole chain should be designed in such a way that promising ideas quickly evolve into real-life applications and become successful products.
Intellectual resources we spend must generate actual returns and serve the Russian economy and industry, as well as improve the quality of life for our people.
Friends and colleagues, I strongly believe that by working hand in hand we can be sure to deliver on all the objectives we have set out for ourselves. We will achieve a major breakthrough in research and technology not only in Siberia, but right across the country. We will definitely improve Russia’s standing among the leaders in research and development.
In conclusion, I would like to wish the participants and guests at this wonderful event, the Technoprom forum, an interesting and fruitful interaction. I wish you every success and all the best.
I know that not only Russian researchers, representatives of the business community and civil society are present at this forum, but also our foreign colleagues.
I would like to thank them for their interest in working with Russia. I wish you every success. Thank you very much.
Thank you and good luck to all of you.
