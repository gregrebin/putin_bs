President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, I would like to take this opportunity to warmly welcome you to Russia. You are our old and trusted friend.
We have very good relations with your country, and certainly the United Arab Emirates is Russia’s leading trade and economic partner in the Middle East, or one of our leading partners. The total trade volume may not be that big – it is only $1.5 billion and could be much higher, but we have excellent prospects for growth.
Great opportunities are opening up in investment cooperation, and I am pleased to highlight your agreement with the Russian Direct Investment Fund and the potential investment in this collaboration, which can reach $5 billion.
I hope that this trend will continue to develop successfully, and we will certainly provide any administrative support that may be required.
Your Highness, we are very glad to see you. Welcome to Russia!
The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed Al Nahyan (re-translated): Your Excellency, I am also happy to see you.
We are doing everything possible to build bridges between our two nations – the Russian Federation and the United Arab Emirates. As you know, our country makes substantial investments around the world. I am very grateful to Your Excellency for giving us the opportunity to build such a new bridge in our relations with Russia.
We have great confidence and trust in your market, and that is why we are in your country today, and I hope that our investment projects will be carried out successfully and continue to grow.
Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
