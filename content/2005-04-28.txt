Jerusalem
President Vladimir Putin: This is a special place. There is a particular feeling inside when visiting Jerusalem, especially at the Lord’s Tomb. It is a very emotional event.
I would like to thank all of you who serve the interests of the Russian Orthodox Church, the interests of Russia, looking after and preserving these places for our Church and our people. It is especially pleasing to see this happening in these days preceding Easter, and it is also the time of Passover here in Israel.
I think this will help make this a successful visit to Israel. This is the first visit by a Russian head of state to this country. We must make an effort to help bring about reconciliation. It is not by chance that the words “Ask for peace for Jerusalem” are written above the Tsar’s Gates here in your church. Let us indeed ask the Lord to give peace to Jerusalem.
