President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
As you may know, last week the Government presented a comprehensive programme of action until 2025, which is aimed at matching and exceeding global economic growth rates no later than 2019–2020. This is certainly a key document for the long-term strategy of Russia’s economic development.
We know that expert groups and representatives of the business community are working on these tasks, drafting of this strategy, as well as proposals and initiatives aimed at reaching the same goals.
It goes without saying that after a thorough and deep analysis of these proposals we need to determine what we will do next: either adopt some proposal as a whole because as a rule they are complete, or after in-depth analysis and additional consultations or some new ideas we will decide that we should link certain things, unite and supplement them and after another serious analysis make a final decision on what road to follow, what initiatives to carry out and on what scale.
I would like to emphasise the main point once again: the plans for national economic development must be clear and realistic, address current and future challenges in the best way possible and reflect the interests of the people and the consensus views of the state, business community and civil society institutions.
It is important to focus our efforts on improving the business climate and making the national economy more competitive, increasing labour productivity and the return on major investment projects, developing small and medium-range businesses, building up non-energy exports and creating new sources of growth in the regions.
Today we will consider expert proposals on ensuring the stable development and technological modernisation of the national economy and discuss whether they are competitive and practical.
Let us start the discussion.

Meeting with Russian Academy of Sciences members.
The discussion touched on the situation in the Academy of Sciences and the current state of affairs in academic research.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
As we are all aware, the strategy for the scientific and technological development of the country was adopted in late 2016, and we agreed back then that one of the most important tasks in this regard is to fill it with concrete projects, areas of research, and so on.
Of course, in the first place, you and your colleagues, members of the Academy of Sciences and scholars, must say what you have to say. We are aware of the importance of the role of interdisciplinary research. That is why, not long ago, we decided to merge two other academies, the academy of medical science and the academy of agricultural science, into one large institution.
Mr Fortov and I discussed these issues and came to the conclusion that we need to think about ways to further shape the administrative structure, to make it more efficient and adapted to current tasks, so that the Academy of Sciences becomes the headquarters of research that determines the scientific research prospects.
We wanted to get together in this format and discuss these issues. I would like to hear what you have to say.

With Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud.
The discussion covered the countries’ cooperation to stabilise the global oil market and the situation in Syria.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, dear friends, I would like to welcome you in Moscow.
I would like to start our meeting by noting that relations between our countries are making steady headway. As for economic ties, there was a certain decline but in the beginning of this year, growth already reached 130 percent.
We are maintaining contacts at the political level and between military departments. Together we are searching for ways to resolve complicated situations, for instance in Syria. Obviously, energy agreements are very important for our countries.
We are grateful to you for your ideas and assistance in cooperation of the OPEC countries with those that are not part of the cartel. Our coordinated actions make it possible to stabilise the situation on world hydrocarbon markets.
We are, of course, looking forward to the visit of the King of Saudi Arabia. I am convinced that the first visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to Russia will be a good sign, a good signal and a good impetus in the development of our interstate ties.
Please convey our best wishes to his Majesty.
Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud (retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much for this opportunity to meet. I am glad to see you in Moscow again. Let me convey to you respects on behalf of his Majesty King of Saudi Arabia.
Today relations between Saudi Arabia and Russia are going through one of the best stages. Our countries have attained mutual understanding on many issues. As for those issues on which we are divided, we have efficient mechanisms for overcoming our differences. We are moving ahead at a fast pace and the current visit will become a big achievement in consolidating relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The main point is that we are building a solid foundation for stabilising the oil market and energy prices and this is creating good opportunities for building our strategic future.
As you rightly pointed out, there are many economic cooperation programmes between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and this is bound to help us build up our cooperation in the future.
There are no points of conflict in our respective policies and we hope we will manage to steer them in the right direction in the interests of both countries. We achieved much in the previous brief stage but more work lies ahead of us.

Vladimir Putin’s article, Russia and India: 70 years together, has been published
The article in The Times of India was published to mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations with India.

Russia and India: 70 years together
This year, we are celebrating the anniversary of a truly historic event. Seventy years ago – on April 13, 1947 – the governments of the USSR and India announced their decision to establish official missions in Delhi and Moscow. This step on our part logically followed up on our course for assisting India on its way to national liberation and contributed to strengthening its independence.
In the decades that have followed, our bilateral partnership has further intensified and strengthened, and has never been subject to expediency. Equal and mutually beneficial relations of the two States have steadily developed. This is quite natural. Our peoples have always had mutual sympathy and respect for each other's spiritual values and culture.
Today, we can take pride in what we have achieved. With Russia's technical and financial assistance, the pioneers of Indian industrialization came into existence: metallurgical complexes in Bhilai, Visakhapatnam and Bokaro, the mining equipment plant in Durgapur, the thermal power station in Neyveli, the electromechanical enterprise in Korba, antibiotics plants in Rishikesh and the pharmaceutical plant in Hyderabad.
Soviet and, later on, Russian scientists and academics participated in the establishment of research and education centers in India. These include the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, research institutes of petroleum industry in Dehradun and Ahmedabad.
We are proud our specialists helped develop India's space program. Thanks to this fruitful bilateral cooperation, in 1975 India's first satellite, Aryabhata, was launched, and Indian citizen Rakesh Sharma travelled into space in 1984 as a crew member of Soyuz T-11.
In August 1971, our countries signed the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, which set forth the fundamental principles of bilateral relations, such as respect for the sovereignty and each other's interests, good‑neighborliness, and peaceful coexistence. In 1993, the Russian Federation and the Republic of India confirmed the inviolability of these basic principles in the new Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation. The Declaration on Strategic Partnership signed in 2000 provides for close coordination of approaches to ensuring international peace and security and resolving pressing global and regional issues. Annual summits have become an established practice in the Indian-Russian bilateral relations allowing us to discuss in a timely manner the efforts taken to accomplish our objectives and set long-term goals. In early June, we will have another summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in St. Petersburg. He is expected to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, in which India will for the first time participate as a partner country.
The legal framework comprising more than 250 documents is being updated on a regular basis. Effective work is carried out within intergovernmental commissions on cooperation in trade and economy, science and technology, as well as culture and military-technical field. Ministries of foreign affairs, security council offices and line ministries maintain continuous dialogue. The interparliamentary and interregional ties, as well as business and humanitarian contacts are actively developing. Military cooperation is also being enhanced: joint land and naval exercises are conducted regularly.
Cooperation in peaceful uses of atomic energy is one of the fundamental components of the relationship between India and Russia. The construction of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant with our assistance is a flagship project in this field. In 2013, the first nuclear power unit was put into operation. In October 2016, the second unit was transferred to the Indian side, and construction of the third and fourth power units began. All of this contributes to the implementation of the plans to develop nuclear energy in India involving the construction of at least 12 power units in its territory by 2020. These goals are stipulated in a joint document – the Strategic Vision for Strengthening India-Russia Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. We intend to further share best practices in this important industry with India and contribute to enhancing its energy security.
Collaboration in the traditional energy sector is successfully developing. The purchase of a block of shares in the Russian company ”Vankorneft“ made by the Indian consortium of companies has become the biggest bilateral deal in the oil industry. The possibilities for the participation of Indian companies in joint hydrocarbons exploration and production projects in the Russian Arctic shelf are currently under consideration. There are also good prospects for cooperation in the solar energy filed, modernization of the existing power plants and construction of new ones in the territory of India.
Large-scale projects are carried out in mechanical engineering, chemical and mining industries, aircraft construction, pharmaceutics and medicine.
One of the priorities is to boost the trade turnover and improve its structure, as well as stimulate economic activity of our business communities. I am referring to enhancing industrial cooperation and increasing supplies of high-tech products, creating a better business and investment environment, and using systems of payments in national currencies.
The decision to start negotiations on a free trade area agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union and India adopted in December 2016 is of particular importance. The possibilities of creating the International North‑South Transport Corridor are being explored. All these factors should promote the development of our bilateral and regional cooperation.
To encourage reciprocal capital inflow, a working group on priority investment projects was established under the Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation. 19 most promising projects have already been selected. Russia is committed to long-term participation in the ”Make in India“ program initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Our countries cooperate intensively in the production of multipurpose weapons and military equipment. Co-production of a unique supersonic cruise missile ”BrahMos“ is our special pride. Since 1960, the overall value of contracts within the framework of military and technical cooperation has amounted to over USD 65 billion, while the portfolio of orders in 2012–2016 exceeded USD 46 billion.
India and Russia are equal partners in international affairs. Our countries support the establishment of a multipolar democratic system of international relations based on strict compliance with the principles of law and resting upon the UN central role. We are willing to further jointly counter challenges and threats of the 21st century, promote the unifying agenda and contribute to maintaining global and regional security.
We effectively interact within BRICS – an association that thanks to our collective efforts is increasing its weight and influence. This June, India will become a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It will considerably enhance the potential of the SCO. India and Russia also work together within the G20 and other international formats.
I would also like to note that our countries closely coordinate positions on such complex issues as settling the situation in Syria and ensuring stability in the Middle East and North Africa region. They significantly contribute to the national reconciliation process in Afghanistan.
I am convinced that the enormous potential of cooperation between the two great powers will be further explored for the benefit of the peoples of India and Russia and the international community in general. We have everything necessary to achieve this – political will of the sides, economic viability and shared global priorities. All this is based on the glorious history of the Indian‑Russian friendship.
Taking this opportunity, I would like to convey the kindest regards to all the citizens of friendly India.
