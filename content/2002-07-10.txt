The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
I am very glad to meet you once again. It is hardly surprising that the Mayor of Moscow is also present here. I know that Bavaria and Moscow have been expanding their contacts for a long time. As you know, Russian-Bavarian trade turnover, which has swelled by an impressive 37% in the past 12 months, exceeds that between Russia and France.
Russian leaders maintain regular contact with the German opposition. I have recently spoken by telephone with Federal Chancellor Schroeder, who supports this policy. Mr Prime Minister, we are very pleased that, regardless of the domestic political situation, broad segments of the German public view Russia as a serious partner. I am sure that Russia will reciprocate.
I also want to greet the new German Ambassador to Russia. We are very glad to see you in Moscow; and we know that you are a very experienced diplomat. To the best of my knowledge, you have worked in London until now. On behalf of the Russian leadership, I would like to ask you to cordially thank the leaders of Germany for their assistance after the crash of the Tupolev Tu-154 airliner. I have recently met the grieving relatives of the deceased; and they have asked me to thank the residents of the small German town over which this tragedy happened and the German leadership for their warm-hearted and informal approach towards solving all problems linked with the tragedy.
Mr Prime Minister, we are very glad to see you in Moscow. We know that you have already met with the Russian Foreign Minister and that you are scheduled to meet with the Defence Minister today.
Welcome to Russia.
