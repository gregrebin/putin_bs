President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, let me wish you welcome to Sochi once again. This is not your first visit. You have already had the chance to see how preparations for the Olympic Games are going.
Nearly all of the facilities are ready and we just have to put in the final effort now, cross the last line and finish all the last touches. Of course, our cooperation with the Olympic Committee is very important in this respect, and so your visit today and your inspection of the state of progress matter a lot to us, as do your assessments.
President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach (translated from Russian): Mr President, first of all, I want to thank you for the genuine hospitality we have received in Sochi and in Russia. It is always a pleasure to come here. Today, we are already looking forward to the Olympic Games here in Sochi next February.
We have complete confidence that the Games’ organisation will be of the highest level. We are very grateful to you for the excellent cooperation that has developed between us.
Sochi and the entire region have come a long way in their development over these last years, and successfully too. This makes a deep impression on us. The Olympic sites will contribute to making the Sochi Olympics unique in the Olympic movement’s history, and the facilities will offer all sportspeople the best possible conditions.
We know from experience that the last three-four months before the opening of the Games are probably the busiest of all. Of course, we are already looking forward to completing our work together so to celebrate a successful Olympic Games in February. 
Once again, thank you very much for this preparation work, and thank you very much for the warm welcome.
Vladimir Putin: It seems to me that you liked the railway station too?
Thomas Bach: I more than liked it, not just for its functionality, but for its architecture too. It impresses me very much that you were able to build this railway station in just four years.
Aside from the architecture and the unique solutions to link the old and new stations, I was also impressed by the way the facilities have been designed to allow people with disabilities to use them. I learned today, for example, that a special path has been laid in the terminal for the visually impaired. I think this is an optimistic sign for the future, a sign that shows how architecture and construction are developing in general in Russia.
Of course, this new station will be used after the Olympics too, and will become part of the Olympic heritage not just for Sochi but for the whole country.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, I wanted to say the very same words – it will be an important part of the Olympics’ legacy.

Before the opening ceremony of the Adler railway station. With President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach.
The new terminal, one of the infrastructure facilities built for the 2014 Olympics, is a modern transport hub that will eventually link together all different types of passenger transport. The railway station has an area of 23,000 square metres and passenger capacity of 15,000 people an hour. Mr Putin and Mr Bach arrived at the station on the new comfortable Lastochka train.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
I want to congratulate all Sochi residents on today’s wonderful event – the opening of this new railway station. Of course, I especially want to thank everyone who worked on this big project – the engineers, designers, and builders. I remember clearly the day we placed a capsule in the foundations here three years ago. It seemed then that there was so much to do that one hardly knew where to begin, as the saying goes, and as for when the project would actually be completed, it seemed hard to believe that it ever would be, given the enormous amount of work.
But today we see that the project has been completed. Friends, this is thanks to your hard work. I see here many of the people who worked at this site. Sochi now has a real transport gateway, a gateway to the city itself, to the entire southern Russian region, and of course to next year’s Olympics.
This station links into a single network all different transport modes – air, road, and rail of course. This will reduce the problems that people previously faced in terms of access and travel convenience, making getting around easier for our country’s people and for everyone coming to the Olympic Games.
The new Adler railway station stands out not just for its optimum logistics solutions and high throughput capacity, but also for the unique technical solutions used, such as the ‘green corridor’, energy efficiency solutions, and quality provision of a barrier-free environment.
The station has an original and distinctive exterior and brilliant architectural design. I am sure that it will become one of Sochi’s recognisable symbols, will convey the spirit and atmosphere of a modern, successful, rapidly developing and future-focused city, and will help Sochi to write its name in world sports history. 
There is only a little time to go, just over three months, before the big celebrations – the start of the Olympics. We hope to amaze everyone taking part in the Olympics, the athletes and the spectators, amaze them with the sportspeople’s memorable performances, the Games’ organisation, the cultural programme, and of course modern and high-quality facilities such as this new railway station in Adler.
Once again, I congratulate everyone in Sochi and thank you all for this excellent achievement and for this event of such importance for the city and the future Olympic participants – the completion of Adler’s railway station.
Thank you very much. Congratulations!

Meeting with heads of the Russian winter sports federations.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues,
I want to present the President of the International Olympic Committee. You already know him well. Allow me on your behalf to wish the International Olympic Committee’s newly elected president success, and to express hope that the IOC will continue to support Russia in preparing for the Olympic Games.
President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach (translated from Russian): Thank you very much, Mr President. 
Thank you for your hospitality and for this opportunity to meet here with the most important people in Russian sport, especially in winter sports. It is nice to see many familiar faces here and many famous sportspeople, past and present. It shows that Russian sport is flourishing.
The International Olympic Committee is very happy with the preparations for the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, and I am sure that this will be a very interesting and excellent 2014 Winter Olympics. Of course, much of this confidence comes from the personal contribution your president is making to getting ready for the Sochi Olympics, and to the personal attention he has given this project throughout these 7 years. You can be proud of the way your head of state has got involved in preparing for a successful Winter Olympics.
I am very pleased to see many of my Russian friends here and am happy to be able to work together with you. I see many friends here at this table. We expect to be working even more closely together over the 102 days remaining until the start of the Olympics, because practice shows that the final days before the Games are always the busiest.
Once the Olympic flame is alight in the Olympic stadium, everything will depend on you, because the Olympics’ success depends a lot on the success of the host country’s team.
You are very lucky that your president is here now, because you can use this chance and honour to ask him many questions and ask for help and support so that your sportspeople will be 100 percent ready. I wish your athletes and teams good luck and success.
Once again, thank you very much, Mr President. I hope to see you again in Sochi soon and have the chance to personally present gold medals to your athletes. Good luck to you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. On my own behalf, and on your behalf, I assured Mr Bach that our sportspeople and fans will do everything possible to ensure that the participants and guests feel at home at the Olympics in Sochi no matter what country they are from and no matter what their ethnic background or sexual orientation. I want to stress this point. 
Thomas Bach: Once more, we want to thank you for your hospitality. We are sure that everyone taking part in the Games will enjoy this same hospitality and your country’s sporting spirit. We have witnessed this over many years now, and I am sure that the Games will be of the highest level.
Thank you for your efforts in organising them.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
There is little time left before the start of the Winter Games in Sochi – just over three months. To be more specific, tomorrow will mark the start of the 100-day countdown.
We can basically consider the challenges of constructing the Olympic facilities to be resolved. Of course, certain problems still remain, areas that require more work. We need to finish a few things, but we can be confident that everything will be completed well, and on time.
And now, of course, it is the sports themselves and our national team’s readiness for the Olympics that are in the spotlight. That is the topic I suggest we discuss today in more detail.
Clearly, our athletes’ commendable, successful performance is no less important than flawlessly hosting the Games and preparing for them. Our nation was a leader in various types of winter sports for many years, setting the bar for world records. I must admit we have lost ground in some areas, and there are a number of athletic fields where we have descended several rungs from our former positions of leadership, which is unfortunate. But overall, I feel this can be remedied.
Together with you, the government has made some serious strides to change this situation for the better. Thus, we have significantly modernised the physical infrastructure for winter sports. Our athletes have worked with the best Russian and foreign coaches, including those who have returned to their fatherland, Russia, from abroad, and are continuing to work here. A great deal of work is also being done to provide athletes with biomedical support.
Still, I must stress that major athletic victories are not a question of prestige or ambition for us. The connection between athletic success at the highest level and developing popular sports is obvious. And naturally, we are all well aware of this.
Examples of outstanding athletes have always served as an impetus for people to get involved in sports, to adopt a healthy lifestyle. And it’s not just a question of prestige, but rather, the health and future of our nation. And naturally, when our athletes achieve outstanding results, this is often a source of particular pride and prestige for the entire nation. This, too, should not be forgotten.
Our fans and sports enthusiasts await victories – and they await them with no less impatience than the Olympic celebration itself.
As you recall, our athletes won only 13 medals during the pre-Olympic period of 2008–2009 at the winter sports world championships, and the Russian national team only made 11th place at the subsequent Games in Vancouver. Now, following the 2012–2013 season championships, we have 23 medals and we are in 5th place according to the unofficial team score. Overall, this is a good position to start from.
We already have 215 Russian athletes who have passed the international qualifications to participate in the Olympic Games in Sochi. They will be competing for 86 of the 98 sets of medals. Moreover, we have the maximum participation quota in five out of fifteen types of sport. In other types of sport, we are a bit below the quota, but the qualifying competitions are not yet complete and we may still add more athletes to the roster.
We justifiably expect that we will be highly competitive in athletic events where we have traditionally been successful, such as hockey, cross-country skiing, biathlon, luge, speed skating and figure skating, as well as areas where Russian athletes are just beginning to make themselves known: freestyle, snowboarding and curling. We have good potential in all the events our athletes are participating in, and that potential must be realised as much as possible.
And naturally, we have every reason to believe that our Paralympic team will be victorious. Last season, we were in first place according to the unofficial team tally, well ahead of our closest competitors.
Incidentally, our Paralympic athletes have also improved their results. In Vancouver, they were in second place, with 31 athletes participating in just three out of five sports. The Sochi Paralympic team now consists of 64 members and will be competing in six types of sport for 72 sets of medals.
You are well aware, friends, of the high level of competition in modern sports, and in order to do well, we must adopt cutting-edge technologies, continuously and dynamically progressing in all types of sports, including the ones included in the Olympic programme.
Of course, we can laugh as much as we want at some of the exotic sports appearing in the programme, but they are now Olympic events. We must participate in them and win them.
In order to reach this objective, it is extremely important to support young athletes, to look for new, gifted youngsters. In a nation as large as Russia, there are many talented, promising children. We shouldn’t sit around and wait for someone to take them by the hand and bring them over; we should take initiative, working to make all types of sports more popular with the help of the media, at educational institutions, through organisations that are truly involved in sports, or ones that can be involved in sports, and through popular competitions.
I am asking the Sports Ministry to work with the sports federations to develop these issues and present specific suggestions.
