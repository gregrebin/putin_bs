President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam Vice President,
I am delighted to welcome you to Russia.
We have long-standing, very good, friendly relations with your country, and you personally have made a very substantial contribution to the development of Russia-Laos relations. We know you as our good and reliable friend. You have visited our country several times and, during your tenure as president of the National Assembly, made a significant contribution to the development of bilateral parliamentary relations.
I ask you to convey our warmest wishes and greetings to the President of Laos. We hope to see him in Russia – I believe we are planning an event in October.
Our relations are developing in many areas. Financial settlements are among the issues of concern; we will talk about this now and consider all the available options to solve this matter.
We are developing humanitarian ties as well. Young people from Laos are studying at our universities, including here in the Russian Far East, where your medical specialists are undergoing training. Defence agencies of our countries maintain contacts as well. I am confident that all these efforts have good prospects for further development.
I would like to thank you for making the decision to come to the Eastern Economic Forum, an efficient platform that serves to establish contacts with numerous partners in this region of the world and hold relevant meetings and negotiations with your Russian colleagues.
Welcome!
Vice President of the Lao People's Democratic Republic Pany Yathotou (retranslated): Mr Putin,
Thank you very much for the invitation to the Eastern Economic Forum. I am very grateful for your invitation and for the opportunity for our delegation to meet with you today.
We highly appreciate our meeting today. It is a good sign of the development of our joint cooperation in various areas. I would like to express my gratitude for the high assessments and warm words regarding the cooperation between our countries over the past period.
I will certainly convey your greetings to President Thongloun Sisoulith.
At the same time, I would like to convey our President's gratitude to you for your invitation to participate as a special guest at this forum, but due to the previously agreed state visit of our President to Cuba to attend the G77 Summit, Comrade Thongloun Sisoulith was unable to attend the event in person.
I am following with excitement the development of the situation in Russia. I would like to take this opportunity to say that under your leadership, despite all the difficulties and challenges from the outside, as well as economic sanctions and the hostile policy of the United States and its Western allies, Russia has been able to maintain internal political and social stability, the Russian economy continues to develop, and Moscow's role and influence in the world and the region in the process of forming a multipolar world order is constantly growing.
At this stage, the ruling party of Laos, our government and people are focused on implementing the decisions adopted at the 11th Congress of our party, the 9th Five-Year Social Development Plan, as well as the two priority national programmes.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Zhang Guoqing, friends,
I am very pleased to see you and to welcome you to Russia, to Vladivostok.
China has traditionally participated in this forum for many years now. I had the pleasure of welcoming the President of the People's Republic of China to it. He participated in person, spoke here, and then took part in the forum in the videoconference format. I would like to take this opportunity to ask you to convey my best wishes to the President of the People's Republic of China, with whom I have friendly work-related and personal relations. This certainly helps promote bilateral relations and ties between our countries.
We know you well as a very business-like person. You headed a major company and now engage in matter of industry. As far as I know, you have already had the chance to meet with your counterparts, deputy prime ministers [Yury] Trutnev and [Denis] Manturov. The latter is in charge of the industrial block in the Government.
I would like to note that thanks primarily to the efforts of our governments and business circles, Russia-China relations in this area – the area of economic cooperation – have reached a very high level. Of course, this is a derivative of what has been achieved in the political sphere, but nevertheless the results are more than good, they are excellent, and every year our trade grows by almost one third. This year, too, over the first seven months of it, the trade is up by about the same amount, I think, 24 percent – to as much as 120 billion. The goal President Xi Jinping and I have set – to reach the US$200 billion mark in trade – can be achieved very soon, already this year.
I am confident that our relations will keep the current pace. We are glad to welcome you, and I would like to thank you for your decision to come and take part in the Eastern Economic Forum.
Welcome.
Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhang Guoqing (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President, for the opportunity to meet with you.
First of all, I would like to pass on to you sincere regards and best wishes from President Xi Jinping. We also wish to offer heartfelt congratulations on the successful organisation of the 8th Eastern Economic Forum.
Under the strategic direction of President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin, China and Russia have deepened their overarching partnership and strategic cooperation in this new era.
Our relations have maintained a consistently high dynamic. As you rightly noted, our countries have provided resolute mutual support in matters concerning our key interests. We are deepening political cooperation and trust and multiplying our mutual interests, bringing our nations closer. Our multi-dimensional practical cooperation is moving forward progressively, and the range of our bilateral cooperation is constantly expanding.
Mr President, you noted the volume of our trade for the first seven months of this year, but in the first eight months of this year, the bilateral turnover reached US$155.1 billion, which is 32 percent higher year-on-year. We have every reason to believe that the goal set at the highest level, to reach US$200 billion in bilateral trade, will be achieved earlier than the end of the year.
Last March, President Xi Jinping made a successful state visit to Russia, during which a new large-scale plan for developing China-Russia relations was outlined and new guidelines were set. Currently, the Chinese nation, under the true leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, centred around comrade Xi Jinping, is promoting the comprehensive Chinese modernisation focused on high-quality development. We are ready to share development opportunities and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with our Russian colleagues.
Vladimir Putin: We highly value and appreciate the fact that, as you mentioned, the President of China made his first foreign visit after his re-election to Russia. This indicates that the relations between Russia and China have reached an unprecedented and historic level in the past few years.
As you said, we will continue working together.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
According to tradition, we meet with representatives of the business and expert communities, moderators, as we call our colleagues who moderate sessions on various topics on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum.
This is always an important and interesting event, and we do it with pleasure, primarily because we want to hear your opinions about the priority areas which are of interest for you and which you discuss with your colleagues during various sessions held as part of the forum.
My colleagues and I are always eager to learn your opinions. This is key to our participatory approach which consists of bringing together businesses and the state in a joint effort to get to the bottom of the matters on our agenda and outline interesting projects and solutions.
Let's not waste time and start our discussion of topics that you believe hold the most promise and are important and interesting for government bodies and businesses, and ultimately for the citizens, because our common goal is to improve life in Russia, in this case, in the Far Eastern region, and to open up prospects for good development, primarily for the people.
Please, let's begin. Mr Trutnev, the floor is yours.
