Vladimir Putin: We have just finished exchanging opinions and information, and consultations on the state of Russian-Georgian relations. I want to say that our consultations were quite productive and absolutely candid. We had a rather candid and interesting conversation because Russia and Georgia want to solve the main problem in their relations, namely, streamlining effective joint efforts to combat terrorism. If I understand the Georgian President correctly, our secret services and experts will expand their contacts. This is the first aspect.
Second. Acting in line with the Georgian Presidentâ€™s proposal, we will order our border-control services to streamline their cooperation and to jointly patrol the state border. At the same time, our respective national Foreign Ministries will discuss border-control issues. And now the last thing. Eduard Shevardnadze has assured me that the terrorists who were arrested in Georgia will be extradited to the Russian Federation in the near future.

I want to add that I appreciate the latest agreements very much. And I hope that they will be implemented for the benefit of our two nations.
