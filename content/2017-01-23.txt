: Mr President, 2016 saw particular volatility on the hydrocarbon markets. We had to work under pressure, but the year set a record in terms of production for Rosneft. Production increased by around 4 percent with total production for the year in liquid equivalent coming to 265 million tonnes. This is a record figure for the company. Of this amount, oil production accounted for 210 million tonnes, and we produced 67 billion cubic metres of gas.
