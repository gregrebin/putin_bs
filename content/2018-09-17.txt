Beginning of meeting with President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Allow me to welcome you cordially to Sochi. We meet regularly, but your previous visit to Russia was exactly one year ago.
Our relations continue to develop energetically and positively. Bilateral trade and economic ties are growing at a rather rapid pace; we cooperate in the field of security, especially in the region, and on the international arena in the broadest sense of the word.
There is a lot to discuss, and some issues are complicated. I am glad to see you, to be able to exchange opinions on this whole set of issues, and to search for solutions to matters still unresolved.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan
(retranslated): I would also like to express my deepest gratitude.
Our trip from Istanbul to Sochi only took about two hours – a very short distance.
We have had several meetings in a short time – in Sochi, in Tehran, and in Istanbul. Undoubtedly, we have exchanged views during these meetings, and I believe that this exchange strengthens our cooperation. Due to our solidarity on regional issues, the regional peoples count on this cooperation.
I believe not only the region, but the whole world is riveted to our meeting today. The statement we will make here after the meeting in Sochi will give new hope to the region, I believe.
Thank you very much.
