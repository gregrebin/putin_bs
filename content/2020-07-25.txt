Greetings on Investigation Officers’ Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades,
Congratulations to the current and former workers of the investigation agencies on the occasion of your professional holiday.
My thanks for your service in ensuring public order, the rule of law and protecting the people’s and state interests, as well as for making a significant contribution to fighting criminal activities.
Honesty, fidelity to principles and strict adherence to the Law have always been the moral and professional beacon for investigation officers.
Today, the officers from the Investigative Committee, investigators from the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service carry on with the best historical traditions.
What you do is more than just getting to the bottom of each particular case with all its subtleties. You stand up for the truth, justice and human dignity, making punishment inescapable for the guilty and protecting the rights of those who suffered from criminal abuse, illegal persecution or false accusations.
It is for this reason that it is essential that every procedural decision an investigation officer takes is justified and irreproachable, guaranteeing that the investigation is effective and exhaustive. Whenever a mistake is made, for whatever reason, it has to be rectified in due course, and the truth restored. After all, the main criteria for judging your work are more than just agency performance statistics. They are about the trust of people and society.
I wish you every success in your challenging and responsible service, happiness and good health to all your families.
Congratulations!
