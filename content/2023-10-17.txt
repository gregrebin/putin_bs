Interview with Rossiya TV channel
The President answered questions from Rossiya-1 TV channel journalist Pavel Zarubin.

Pavel Zarubin: President Biden is pondering running for re-election, and in his latest interview he said that the main priority of the collective West is to finally put Putin “down where he cannot cause the kind of trouble he’s been causing.” What kind of trouble do you think you were causing and what do you feel about this desire to put you down?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: You know the point is… First of all, I believe that President Biden is certainly one of the most experienced politicians in the world, in terms of his time in the so-called upper echelons of power. He has been in politics for a long time and, of course, he is an experienced person who knows what tasks he should set for himself and how to achieve them. If they have no other tasks but how to construct relations with Russia, that’s fine in a sense.

So, despite the experience I have mentioned, still…We have a well-known saying in Russia: live a lot, learn a lot. And this applies not only to President Biden, but to the political elites in the United States as a whole. We must learn to respect others, and then there will be no need to put anyone down. But the desire to suppress someone all the time for some reason or no reason at all leads to problems. Of course, they love doing that with their usual brilliance – and they do it well: they put on a fake smile and pat everyone on the shoulder. But respect for other people, for other countries, for other nations lies in something else – in taking their interests into account. And then there will be no need to put anyone down.
But I will repeat the point that the desire to suppress someone means exactly that they have to learn a lot. And the key is to learn respect for others. It includes, among other things, the ability to search for compromises.
But if they are taking an interest in Russia, that is not a bad thing actually.
Pavel Zarubin: Actually, is it possible to put you down?
Vladimir Putin: This is not about me personally. This is about the country’s interests, and it is impossible to put down Russia’s interests, they will have to be taken into account.
Pavel Zarubin: Today, you had several back-to-back bilateral meetings. Clearly, journalists were most interested in your talks with Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban. It is also clear that he will now face obstruction from his Western counterparts. What do you think about these methods? Not only are active politicians being targeted but also leaders who used to work with you and cooperate with you in the past.
Vladimir Putin: Regarding my counterpart today, Mr Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, he is part of a small cohort of European politicians who know how to assert their interests. He does this persistently, consistently, and in my view, quite tactfully. Our views do not always overlap, and moreover, we often find ourselves on entirely different platforms. But this does not prevent us from talking and looking for solutions to various issues and problems.

Even though our opportunities to maintain contacts and develop relations are limited due to the current geopolitical situation, it is satisfying that we maintain and develop relations with many countries in Europe. Hungary is one of these countries.
For the past decades, relations between Hungary and Russia have been built exclusively on respect for each other’s interests and based on everything positive given to us by the past. It relates to many areas of activity, first of all, the economy. Last year, our trade and economic interaction grew by more than 80 percent, which is a very significant figure. Unfortunately, in the first seven months of this year, we saw a 35 percent decline. The good news is that it does not eliminate last year’s 80-percent growth, but there is reason to think about what we can do additionally to improve the process. This is the first issue.
Second. Naturally, it is very important that we have the opportunity to exchange opinions on both bilateral relations and also on the situation in Europe and the world with a European country, in this case, Hungary. We know that our positions are not always aligned, but I believe it is extremely important that we have the opportunity to exchange opinions.
We are happy to have this meeting, which, I am sure, will be positive. Thank you.
Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban (retranslated): Mr President,
I have calculated that this is our 13th meeting since 2009. There have been difficult meetings but not as difficult as this one; we have never been in a more serious situation.
Hungary has never wanted to stand against Russia; on the contrary, its goal has always been to build and expand the best mutual contacts. And we have managed to do so.
However, due to the military operation and sanctions, our relations and the very basis of what we built together has been severely damaged.
Mr President, you know Hungary and you know its capabilities. We are doing what we can in this situation, that is, we are trying to save what is left of our bilateral contacts. We are interested in maintaining this cooperation not only at the level of communication, but at the level of the economy, while it is possible.
I want to thank you for the fact that Rosatom remains our reliable partner. I also want to thank Gazprom for fulfilling its contractual obligations. This helped us save much of what we have achieved together. Nobody likes it when the results of their work are rendered null through no fault of theirs.
We hope that we will continue our interaction.

I recently met with your Vice President on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. Today we have an opportunity to continue that dialog, that conversation.

We in Russia know you as a reliable friend. Actually, you and I were university students in Leningrad at almost the same time, during the same years. I was there during the same period as you.
Overall, the political level [of our relations] is quite high. What we need to do is fill it with more economic content. Unfortunately, bilateral trade further decreased last year. Nevertheless, I believe there are prospects, good prospects. We will discuss this now.
President of Laos Thongloun Sisoulith (in Russian): I would like to recall my Russian and tell you this.
Thank you very much, Mr President, for finding the opportunity to meet today despite being so busy. I did not have a chance to attend the forum in Vladivostok where you had invited me, but I was in Cuba at the time. I am grateful to you for finding the time to meet with Vice President Pany Yathotou. She substantively informed me about the results of the forum and the agreements you reached, and I was very happy about that.
I know we have not met for a very long time. The last time was maybe in 2017 in Singapore, a brief conversation. But time flies. The way you were standing and talking to me then became very popular in Laos. People kept asking, what language were they speaking? The people in Laos were deeply touched when you offered me your words of friendship and understanding.
Mr President, if you do not mind, I would like to hear your opinion first, and then we will exchange views.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends. I am very happy to see you again. I remember our Moscow meeting in 2021, when we marked the 100th anniversary of our diplomatic relations.

The Soviet Union was the first country to recognise Mongolia, and next September, we will celebrate the 85th anniversary of our joint victory in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. Over 10,000 Red Army soldiers and commanders gave their lives defending Mongolia.
Much was done at that time to build the foundation and economy of Mongolia, its healthcare and education systems. In 2019, a backbone document, the Treaty on Strategic Partnership, was signed.
Last year, our mutual trade increased significantly, by some 40 percent. This year, the growth slowed slightly. But we have something to discuss in this area, and our intergovernmental commission should pay proper attention to it.
We also have major projects in many areas, including joint projects with the People’s Republic of China. These are, for instance, the construction of a gas pipeline through Mongolia to China. Everyone approved of this project and all parties want to participate. The next step is its implementation. I think, we will be moving fast.
There are also such famous flagship projects as the Ulaanbaatar Railway. We will talk about it later in detail.
I am very happy to see you.
President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
It pleases me to see you again as well. I warmly recall our previous meeting and the wide-ranging exchange we had on our relations and cooperation during my official visit to Russia on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between our countries. I would like to point out that we adopted a joint declaration on the occasion of the centenary and outlined short- and medium-term goals and objectives for our cooperation and a roadmap for advancing our relations and cooperation.
As you mentioned earlier, in 2019, we signed the Treaty on Friendship and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership which formed the basis for our ongoing cooperation and friendship. Of course, much time has passed since then, and there have been some geopolitical complexities, economic challenges, and issues related to the world order. However, we are pleased to note that the economic situation is improving.
Developing relations with Russia has always been our top foreign policy priority. For centuries, we have had warm and friendly feelings towards the Russian people. I also believe that we must never forget the history of friendship between our nations, the legacy of our forefathers whether it be during times of war, when we supported each other, or during peacetime and the era of socialism. We must always remember this.
Next year marks the 85th anniversary of joint victory on the Khalkhin Gol River. Mr President, I once again extend my invitation to you to pay a state visit to our beautiful country during the celebration of this glorious date. Also, as you are aware, 2025 will mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, and we will celebrate this momentous event with great solemnity. We must not forget the historical feat of the Russian people who saved the world from the threat of Nazism and I believe that we should commemorate this glorious anniversary together.
I am pleased that our cooperation and relations have intensified in recent years. Not long ago, the Russian Parliament Speaker, Mr Volodin, visited Mongolia. The first meeting of the commission on cooperation between the State Great Khural of Mongolia and the State Duma of the Russian Federation was held, and a working group was set up. Mongolia has always strived to cooperate with Russia across all areas of mutual interest.
We have a significant stake in cooperating with Russia on all major energy, railway and motorway projects that we plan to implement in the coming years. The Ulaanbaatar Railway, our joint venture and a symbol of our friendship, currently handles 30 million tonnes of cargo per year. We have an excellent opportunity to increase the cargo volume to 100 million tonnes per year.

Russia and Pakistan have traditionally enjoyed friendly partnership relations. This year, our countries marked the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations. However, our main focus is on ensuring regional security and stability.
Regarding the economy, Russia has traditionally been a supplier of food and grains. Last year, bilateral trade increased to acceptable levels overall. In just the first several months of this year, I believe, Russia has exported one million tonnes of grain to your country. We are prepared to fulfil our commitments and, notably, the prerequisites for this are in place.
Last year, we had a record-breaking harvest of 158 million tonnes of grain. This year looks promising as well, and it is clear now that it will be around 137–138 million tonnes. In other words, our export potential will be substantial, nearly the same as last year, around 50–60 million tonnes.
However, our capacity in trade and the economy goes far beyond that; the potential is much greater. Today, we will discuss this, and hear from our colleagues. I hope to hear what your colleagues have to say as well. Let us exchange opinions and ideas on what else we can do to advance our relations across all areas of interest.
Acting Prime Minister of Pakistan Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar: Thank you, Mr President, for having me. I’m really delighted, along with my team, to meet one of the most important players of our neighbourhood, which we feel Russia is.
No doubt, you did mention about the potential of Russia, which we do see and appreciate, that it’s a lot more than that. Be it in the energy sector, be it in the agricultural sector, be it in its security capacities, in its defence capabilities. There are so many areas where I personally feel that Pakistan and Russia have a convergence of interest – terrorism, for one. And the regional approach, which emanates particularly from Afghanistan and in and around the area which is traditionally more influenced by the Russian Federation, and the neighbourhood in which we reside along with China – deserves a regional and common approach other than extra-regional powers.
I think we are the first who would have the implications, so we should be the foremost to take the initiative, and take the initiative and have the coordination and cooperation in the defence area, in the intelligence area, in the counter-terrorism, and so on and so forth. And I believe our side has very constructive engagement with the Russian authorities, with the Russian Federation’s state apparatus.
I fortunately had a chance to visit Moscow, when I was a senator, and I was mesmerised by the kind of architecture, particularly the representation of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity, its churches. And I just realised that we are even more close culturally in terms of value systems. The Orthodox Christianity does represent cultural values which are very close to home – family, ethical values, which is probably not that much popular beyond this region, which has more…well, Russia has a Eurasian identity, you have a presence in Europe and a presence in Asia. But at core, at heart, we feel we are more Asians, and we feel more near you.
As far as energy is concerned, I think, we are an energy-deficient country. With a population of almost 240 million people, it is itself a huge market. And we do understand that our energy minister just attended Energy Week in Russia, with very fruitful and constructive engagement from your side and the team came with some concrete proposals, be it the supply of oil, gas. We are thinking of some creative options to explore or to do.

Our relations have always been based on mutual respect, friendship and regard for each other’s interests, and they are still developing in a wide range of areas, including in the cultural, economic and political spheres.
Unfortunately, amid the turbulence in international relations, our mutual trade decreased slightly last year. I hope that the joint commission on bilateral trade and economic cooperation will make its contribution to reverse this trend.
I am very pleased to note that our cultural relations have not been put on hold. As of today, 150 young people from Thailand are studying in Russia. The tourist flow is increasing; in January-September 2023, almost one million Russian nationals visited Thailand. In 2024–2025, we will hold cross years of cultural exchanges and tourism in Russia and Thailand.
Mr Prime Minister, we are cooperating actively on the global stage. For our part, we will do our best to make our relations develop as intensively as possible and contribute to the development of our states.
I am very happy to see you, and it is nice to meet you.
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand Srettha Thavisin (retranslated): I am happy to meet with you today. As you said, Thailand and Russia enjoy long-term friendly relations, and we recently marked the 125th anniversary of our diplomatic ties.
We do not have much time today, so I will speak of what is most important. This includes agricultural production issues.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President, friends. I am happy to see you.
First of all, I would like to ask you to convey my best wishes to the General Secretary [of the Vietnam Communist Party Central Committee].
The relations between our countries are developing in a traditionally friendly atmosphere.

Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the backbone document between our countries, the Treaty on Principles of Friendly Relations. It was signed in June 1994. But the relations between Russia and Vietnam have deeper roots and there is no need to say how close our peoples are and how this connection was formed in the previous decades.
In the beginning of our meeting, I would like to speak about the foundation of our relations, the foundation of relations between any countries, which is trade and economic ties.
Unfortunately, last year we saw a certain decline in our trade and economic interaction. But this year, there is a trend towards improvement, and the growth in the first half of this year was over 6 percent. A joint intergovernmental commission is working to make trade ties develop at the pace we need. From the Russian side, it is headed by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko, who is also present here.
Since 2015, a free trade agreement between the EAEU and Vietnam has been in force, and I believe that its potential has not been fully unlocked yet.
Cultural ties are also developing. In this regard, I would like to note a very important issue that symbolises our relations: the unveiling of a monument to comrade Ho Chi Minh in St Petersburg on June 30. The unveiling was to mark the 100th anniversary of his first visit to Russia’s northern capital. The Russian Culture Days in Vietnam were also successfully held in July.
Of course, we are also actively cooperating on the global stage.
Overall, we have an extensive agenda, and we are very happy to see you. I am sure that this meeting will be efficient, constructive and fruitful.
President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Vo Van Thuong (retranslated): Mr President,
I am very happy to meet with you today as with a close and great friend of the people of Vietnam. I would like to use this occasion to wish you a belated happy birthday. I wish you good health so that you can govern Russia well, leading it to become even stronger and more powerful under your guidance.
Thank you very much for the congratulations you sent to me on my election as President of Vietnam. Thank you for the kind regards you sent to me via Comrade Medvedev
, Comrade Lebedev
and, quite recently, Comrade Volodin
.
I would like to convey warm greetings from General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen Phu Trong and other supreme leaders of Vietnam.
Vietnam highly and consistently values comprehensive strategic partnership between our countries and the years-long affinity and close ties between them.
Russia is a top foreign policy priority for Vietnam. This is why we want to develop relations with your country, substantially and effectively.
The people of Vietnam will never forget the heartfelt assistance we received from the Soviet Union, Russia and Russian people at the difficult time of war and now when we are developing our country.
Many Vietnamese, including myself, hold in our hearts the picture of the beautiful Russian scenery, the Russian character and the kind Russian people. We saw and felt this when we visited Russia or studied there.
We are glad the relations between our countries have recently been developing in all areas. Despite COVID-19 and other problems, our countries maintain contacts at various levels, including at the high and top levels. These contacts help us build up mutual trust and warm, positive relations.
This year, we welcomed Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia and Chairman of the United Russia Party Dmitry Medvedev to Vietnam. We also met with Comrade [Vyacheslav] Lebedev and Deputy Prime Minister [Dmitry] Chernyshenko. And yesterday we welcomed Comrade [Vyacheslav] Volodin.
The Defence Minister, the Public Security Minister and the Deputy Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam visited Russia. The symbolic event that took place in our bilateral relations this year, which you have mentioned, – the unveiling of a monument to President Ho Chi Minh in St Petersburg – was attended by Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee Nguyen Van Nen. I would like to note that St Petersburg and Ho Chi Minh City maintain close ties and cooperation.
We are grateful to the St Peterburg City Administration, to you personally and to the Russian authorities for helping us conduct that solemn ceremony. As I have said, it was a symbolic event in the history of relations between our countries.
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen Phu Trong, I and other leaders of Vietnam are looking forward to your official visit to Vietnam to discuss the main aspects of cooperation between our countries. I believe that your future visit to Vietnam will be a joyful event for Vietnamese people and a landmark in our bilateral relations.
As for our trade and economic cooperation, we can report certain achievements, despite all the difficulties. They may be minor achievements and our trade is not as large as in previous years and is below our countries’ potential, but I believe that it is a successful outcome to our endeavours.
I have said this because there have been problems and challenges in the global situation over the past years. But what we have achieved is the result of our joint efforts. I would like to note that Vietnam and its government are working hard to settle these problems effectively and once and for all.
I would like to say a few words about our oil and gas cooperation. We are grateful to Russia for helping Vietnam create this sector from scratch. We achieved positive results over that period.
