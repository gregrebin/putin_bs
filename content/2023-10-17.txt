Pavel Zarubin: President Biden is pondering running for re-election, and in his latest interview he said that the main priority of the collective West is to finally put Putin “down where he cannot cause the kind of trouble he’s been causing.” What kind of trouble do you think you were causing and what do you feel about this desire to put you down?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: You know the point is… First of all, I believe that President Biden is certainly one of the most experienced politicians in the world, in terms of his time in the so-called upper echelons of power. He has been in politics for a long time and, of course, he is an experienced person who knows what tasks he should set for himself and how to achieve them. If they have no other tasks but how to construct relations with Russia, that’s fine in a sense.

So, despite the experience I have mentioned, still…We have a well-known saying in Russia: live a lot, learn a lot. And this applies not only to President Biden, but to the political elites in the United States as a whole. We must learn to respect others, and then there will be no need to put anyone down. But the desire to suppress someone all the time for some reason or no reason at all leads to problems. Of course, they love doing that with their usual brilliance – and they do it well: they put on a fake smile and pat everyone on the shoulder. But respect for other people, for other countries, for other nations lies in something else – in taking their interests into account. And then there will be no need to put anyone down.
But I will repeat the point that the desire to suppress someone means exactly that they have to learn a lot. And the key is to learn respect for others. It includes, among other things, the ability to search for compromises.
But if they are taking an interest in Russia, that is not a bad thing actually.
Pavel Zarubin: Actually, is it possible to put you down?
Vladimir Putin: This is not about me personally. This is about the country’s interests, and it is impossible to put down Russia’s interests, they will have to be taken into account.
Pavel Zarubin: Today, you had several back-to-back bilateral meetings. Clearly, journalists were most interested in your talks with Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban. It is also clear that he will now face obstruction from his Western counterparts. What do you think about these methods? Not only are active politicians being targeted but also leaders who used to work with you and cooperate with you in the past.
Vladimir Putin: Regarding my counterpart today, Mr Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, he is part of a small cohort of European politicians who know how to assert their interests. He does this persistently, consistently, and in my view, quite tactfully. Our views do not always overlap, and moreover, we often find ourselves on entirely different platforms. But this does not prevent us from talking and looking for solutions to various issues and problems.

Even though our opportunities to maintain contacts and develop relations are limited due to the current geopolitical situation, it is satisfying that we maintain and develop relations with many countries in Europe. Hungary is one of these countries.
For the past decades, relations between Hungary and Russia have been built exclusively on respect for each other’s interests and based on everything positive given to us by the past. It relates to many areas of activity, first of all, the economy. Last year, our trade and economic interaction grew by more than 80 percent, which is a very significant figure. Unfortunately, in the first seven months of this year, we saw a 35 percent decline. The good news is that it does not eliminate last year’s 80-percent growth, but there is reason to think about what we can do additionally to improve the process. This is the first issue.
Second. Naturally, it is very important that we have the opportunity to exchange opinions on both bilateral relations and also on the situation in Europe and the world with a European country, in this case, Hungary. We know that our positions are not always aligned, but I believe it is extremely important that we have the opportunity to exchange opinions.
We are happy to have this meeting, which, I am sure, will be positive. Thank you.
Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban (retranslated): Mr President,
I have calculated that this is our 13th meeting since 2009. There have been difficult meetings but not as difficult as this one; we have never been in a more serious situation.
Hungary has never wanted to stand against Russia; on the contrary, its goal has always been to build and expand the best mutual contacts. And we have managed to do so.
However, due to the military operation and sanctions, our relations and the very basis of what we built together has been severely damaged.
Mr President, you know Hungary and you know its capabilities. We are doing what we can in this situation, that is, we are trying to save what is left of our bilateral contacts. We are interested in maintaining this cooperation not only at the level of communication, but at the level of the economy, while it is possible.
I want to thank you for the fact that Rosatom remains our reliable partner. I also want to thank Gazprom for fulfilling its contractual obligations. This helped us save much of what we have achieved together. Nobody likes it when the results of their work are rendered null through no fault of theirs.
We hope that we will continue our interaction.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, I am delighted to see you.
I recently met with your Vice President on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. Today we have an opportunity to continue that dialog, that conversation.

We in Russia know you as a reliable friend. Actually, you and I were university students in Leningrad at almost the same time, during the same years. I was there during the same period as you.
Overall, the political level [of our relations] is quite high. What we need to do is fill it with more economic content. Unfortunately, bilateral trade further decreased last year. Nevertheless, I believe there are prospects, good prospects. We will discuss this now.
President of Laos Thongloun Sisoulith (in Russian): I would like to recall my Russian and tell you this.
Thank you very much, Mr President, for finding the opportunity to meet today despite being so busy. I did not have a chance to attend the forum in Vladivostok where you had invited me, but I was in Cuba at the time. I am grateful to you for finding the time to meet with Vice President Pany Yathotou. She substantively informed me about the results of the forum and the agreements you reached, and I was very happy about that.
I know we have not met for a very long time. The last time was maybe in 2017 in Singapore, a brief conversation. But time flies. The way you were standing and talking to me then became very popular in Laos. People kept asking, what language were they speaking? The people in Laos were deeply touched when you offered me your words of friendship and understanding.
Mr President, if you do not mind, I would like to hear your opinion first, and then we will exchange views.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends. I am very happy to see you again. I remember our Moscow meeting in 2021, when we marked the 100th anniversary of our diplomatic relations.

The Soviet Union was the first country to recognise Mongolia, and next September, we will celebrate the 85th anniversary of our joint victory in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. Over 10,000 Red Army soldiers and commanders gave their lives defending Mongolia.
Much was done at that time to build the foundation and economy of Mongolia, its healthcare and education systems. In 2019, a backbone document, the Treaty on Strategic Partnership, was signed.
Last year, our mutual trade increased significantly, by some 40 percent. This year, the growth slowed slightly. But we have something to discuss in this area, and our intergovernmental commission should pay proper attention to it.
We also have major projects in many areas, including joint projects with the People’s Republic of China. These are, for instance, the construction of a gas pipeline through Mongolia to China. Everyone approved of this project and all parties want to participate. The next step is its implementation. I think, we will be moving fast.
There are also such famous flagship projects as the Ulaanbaatar Railway. We will talk about it later in detail.
I am very happy to see you.
President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
It pleases me to see you again as well. I warmly recall our previous meeting and the wide-ranging exchange we had on our relations and cooperation during my official visit to Russia on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between our countries. I would like to point out that we adopted a joint declaration on the occasion of the centenary and outlined short- and medium-term goals and objectives for our cooperation and a roadmap for advancing our relations and cooperation.
As you mentioned earlier, in 2019, we signed the Treaty on Friendship and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership which formed the basis for our ongoing cooperation and friendship. Of course, much time has passed since then, and there have been some geopolitical complexities, economic challenges, and issues related to the world order. However, we are pleased to note that the economic situation is improving.
Developing relations with Russia has always been our top foreign policy priority. For centuries, we have had warm and friendly feelings towards the Russian people. I also believe that we must never forget the history of friendship between our nations, the legacy of our forefathers whether it be during times of war, when we supported each other, or during peacetime and the era of socialism. We must always remember this.
Next year marks the 85th anniversary of joint victory on the Khalkhin Gol River. Mr President, I once again extend my invitation to you to pay a state visit to our beautiful country during the celebration of this glorious date. Also, as you are aware, 2025 will mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, and we will celebrate this momentous event with great solemnity. We must not forget the historical feat of the Russian people who saved the world from the threat of Nazism and I believe that we should commemorate this glorious anniversary together.
I am pleased that our cooperation and relations have intensified in recent years. Not long ago, the Russian Parliament Speaker, Mr Volodin, visited Mongolia. The first meeting of the commission on cooperation between the State Great Khural of Mongolia and the State Duma of the Russian Federation was held, and a working group was set up. Mongolia has always strived to cooperate with Russia across all areas of mutual interest.
We have a significant stake in cooperating with Russia on all major energy, railway and motorway projects that we plan to implement in the coming years. The Ulaanbaatar Railway, our joint venture and a symbol of our friendship, currently handles 30 million tonnes of cargo per year. We have an excellent opportunity to increase the cargo volume to 100 million tonnes per year.
