Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Dear friends and colleagues,
Allow me to cordially welcome you once again, this time in Moscow.
I am aware, Mr President, that you had a very hard day yesterday, and I was glad to hear that you are satisfied with the work and its results.
We had a chance to discuss practically the whole range of issues in our cooperation in an informal atmosphere in Sochi. We discussed both economics and investment activities.
Important positive shifts have recently taken place in the relations between the Russian Federation and Bulgaria. Chief of them is the creation of a new atmosphere of interaction and, as we note, the desire to cooperate in every field.
I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your country and I will gladly go next year during the events to mark the 125th anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria from the Ottoman yoke.
