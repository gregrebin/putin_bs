Question: In what fashion will the new organization build relations in the matter of ensuring security in Central Asia and Middle Asia with the SCO and CIS?
Vladimir Putin: The purpose and meaning of the activities of the Collective Security Treaty Organization is to ensure the security, territorial integrity and sovereignty of member countries. This is the principal task. We proceeded on this assumption and recently worked persistently to make its work efficient. For this purpose we had to create the necessary instruments.
We have today conclusively agreed as to what kind of instruments those will be — unified headquarters, the approval of rapid deployment forces. And, as my colleagues have already said here, with definite military components. It is also political activity, the coordination of positions, of which my colleagues have already spoken. All this combined must ensure the accomplishment of the tasks which face the Collective Security Treaty Organization. The other organizations of a regional character, like the SCO and CIS, do not have such instruments, but common tasks exist and one of the most important is to fight against terrorism and the narco-threat.
It means that organizations of this kind — and those you've mentioned — should not interfere with each other, but — I am sure — supplement each other. This I do not doubt.
Thank you.
