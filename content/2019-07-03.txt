Meeting with Mikhail Shemyakin
Vladimir Putin met in the Kremlin with painter and sculptor Mikhail Shemyakin.

The Kremlin, Moscow
With painter and sculptor Mikhail Shemyakin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Please. Mr Shemyakin, I see you have brought along something interesting.
Mikhail Shemyakin: Just some aesthetic junk. (Laughter.) It is one of the 16 volumes I am working on now. Four volumes are finished. This is the first volume titled Letter. Word. Text.
You probably know that for the past 15 years I have been working on the analysis of human psychology in art. A laboratory has been created that is analysing the developments in this sphere in the West and compares its findings to what is taking place in Russia.
And this is a book published by the FSB, The Investigation Continues. Both you and I are in this book. This is me (shows on the overleaf), and this is you, in a different uniform.
Vladimir Putin: Oh my, where did you find it?
Mikhail Shemyakin: It is one of a series of books. It is the 10th volume. I help them with the design and also with some stories. The whole department send their regards.
Vladimir Putin: Good, thank you.
Mikhail Shemyakin: They remember you as a young and active man.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. And what is this?
Mikhail Shemyakin: These are my projects that I would like to discuss with you today. But above all it is my legacy. As it is, I believe that everything I have accomplished after I was kicked out of the Soviet Union with $50 – I have established an institute and collected a huge and unique library, a collection of works and rare autographs, starting from Igor Stravinsky, etc. – I believe that everything I have done should keep going for as long as I live, and that it should belong to Russia.
In short, I would like to donate everything I have accomplished and collected to Russia, so that when I pass away – none of us are immortal – my legacy continues to work. As usual, I ask for your assistance to make this happen.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Shemyakin, but what about your foundation? You have created a foundation in St Petersburg.
Mikhail Shemyakin: The materials I have brought are from that foundation. Do you remember that you gave me a studio where I could live and work? I did not live there for a single day but immediately turned it into an education centre.
I have a small flat in another place, where I live with my wife Sarah on and off. For the past 16 years the foundation has conducted annual academic and educational programmes. We also hold academic exhibitions.
This is an exhibition catalogue. Besides, I am a professor at the Stieglitz Academy, where I train a group of students. They will defend their theses next year. I have six students and two postgraduates. They will graduate next year. I have actually trained international-class professionals.
We are being pushed back everywhere, as you know, with these ridiculous sanctions. But we fight back. So, I believe that “victory will be ours,” as usual and as one of our leaders used to say.
Vladimir Putin: Very good. Let us talk about this in greater detail.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Now aboutour second issue, which is the main issue, legislative support for implementing national projects. I want to say a few words about this.
Regulatory support for national projects is undoubtedly a complicated issue. It covers a wide range of new areas where we need to build a system of legal regulations almost from scratch.
I primarily mean the digital economy. We will have to adopt over 50 regulatory acts, 50 laws. In spite of the sophisticated and challenging nature of this work, we must do it professionally and with high quality, and set a legal background for national projects and development programmes. This concerns both the new areas that I mentioned and the traditional sectors, specifically the business climate, promoting exports, the environment, housing and public utilities, which we just talked about, transport and many other areas.
I know, and Mr Medvedev and I have discussed this many times, the Government has done a lot in this respect. Some framework laws have been passed, and more have been submitted for consideration by the parliament. It is important to expedite the background work for this, but that does not mean it should be done at the expense of quality. We do not need to rush in this respect. But it is essential to adopt the necessary acts during the current spring session or at least the autumn session, better at the beginning.
If there are any difficulties with this, let’s discuss it now. I would ask our colleagues from the Presidential Executive Office to oversee this important process and help the government promote these issues in the State Duma.
