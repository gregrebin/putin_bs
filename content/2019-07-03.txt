Meeting with Mikhail Shemyakin
Vladimir Putin met in the Kremlin with painter and sculptor Mikhail Shemyakin.
July 3, 2019
20:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
With painter and sculptor Mikhail Shemyakin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Please. Mr Shemyakin, I see you have brought along something interesting.
Mikhail Shemyakin: Just some aesthetic junk. (Laughter.) It is one of the 16 volumes I am working on now. Four volumes are finished. This is the first volume titled Letter. Word. Text.
You probably know that for the past 15 years I have been working on the analysis of human psychology in art. A laboratory has been created that is analysing the developments in this sphere in the West and compares its findings to what is taking place in Russia.
And this is a book published by the FSB, The Investigation Continues. Both you and I are in this book. This is me (shows on the overleaf), and this is you, in a different uniform.
Vladimir Putin: Oh my, where did you find it?
Mikhail Shemyakin: It is one of a series of books. It is the 10th volume. I help them with the design and also with some stories. The whole department send their regards.
Vladimir Putin: Good, thank you.
Mikhail Shemyakin: They remember you as a young and active man.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. And what is this?
Mikhail Shemyakin: These are my projects that I would like to discuss with you today. But above all it is my legacy. As it is, I believe that everything I have accomplished after I was kicked out of the Soviet Union with $50 – I have established an institute and collected a huge and unique library, a collection of works and rare autographs, starting from Igor Stravinsky, etc. – I believe that everything I have done should keep going for as long as I live, and that it should belong to Russia.
In short, I would like to donate everything I have accomplished and collected to Russia, so that when I pass away – none of us are immortal – my legacy continues to work. As usual, I ask for your assistance to make this happen.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Shemyakin, but what about your foundation? You have created a foundation in St Petersburg.
Mikhail Shemyakin: The materials I have brought are from that foundation. Do you remember that you gave me a studio where I could live and work? I did not live there for a single day but immediately turned it into an education centre.
I have a small flat in another place, where I live with my wife Sarah on and off. For the past 16 years the foundation has conducted annual academic and educational programmes. We also hold academic exhibitions.
This is an exhibition catalogue. Besides, I am a professor at the Stieglitz Academy, where I train a group of students. They will defend their theses next year. I have six students and two postgraduates. They will graduate next year. I have actually trained international-class professionals.
We are being pushed back everywhere, as you know, with these ridiculous sanctions. But we fight back. So, I believe that “victory will be ours,” as usual and as one of our leaders used to say.
Vladimir Putin: Very good. Let us talk about this in greater detail.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Now aboutour second issue, which is the main issue, legislative support for implementing national projects. I want to say a few words about this.
Regulatory support for national projects is undoubtedly a complicated issue. It covers a wide range of new areas where we need to build a system of legal regulations almost from scratch.
I primarily mean the digital economy. We will have to adopt over 50 regulatory acts, 50 laws. In spite of the sophisticated and challenging nature of this work, we must do it professionally and with high quality, and set a legal background for national projects and development programmes. This concerns both the new areas that I mentioned and the traditional sectors, specifically the business climate, promoting exports, the environment, housing and public utilities, which we just talked about, transport and many other areas.
I know, and Mr Medvedev and I have discussed this many times, the Government has done a lot in this respect. Some framework laws have been passed, and more have been submitted for consideration by the parliament. It is important to expedite the background work for this, but that does not mean it should be done at the expense of quality. We do not need to rush in this respect. But it is essential to adopt the necessary acts during the current spring session or at least the autumn session, better at the beginning.
If there are any difficulties with this, let’s discuss it now. I would ask our colleagues from the Presidential Executive Office to oversee this important process and help the government promote these issues in the State Duma.

Development of Parliamentarism International Forum
Vladimir Putin took part in the second Development of Parliamentarism International Forum.
July 3, 2019
15:25
Moscow
1 of 4
At the second Development of Parliamentarism International Forum.
The main topics of the forum are international security and stability, development of the digital economy, youth and environmental policy, and the prospects for the work of inter-parliamentary institutions.
The forum was attended by representatives of 132 states, about 800 parliamentarians and experts, including, inter alia, President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Gabriela Cuevas Barron, Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey Mustafa Sentop, President of the Pan-African Parliament Roger Nkodo Dang, President of the Baltic Sea Parliamentary Conference Jorgen Pettersson and others.
The first Development of Parliamentarism International Forum was held in Moscow in June 2018.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, friends,
I am absolutely delighted to welcome to the Russian capital all our guests – heads of parliaments, heads of international parliamentary organisations, people’s representatives in the broadest sense of the word, politicians, scientists and experts representing a whole range of different countries.
Your forum is being held for the second time and has already proved its relevance and significance, the absolute relevance and importance of inter-parliamentary interaction and dialogue. The modern world badly needs such broad cooperation, an open and free exchange of views, building trust and seeking mutual understanding.
Its global agenda is complex and controversial. It is filled with great challenges and real threats that do actually exist, the answers to which can and will be effective only if these threats are recognised by the entire international community and if the states wish to discuss and find joint solutions to common challenges in a rapidly changing world.
Its transformation to multi-polarity is already obvious. At the same time, the stubborn unwillingness of some countries to accept this new reality results in an increased confrontation in the world, ignoring international law, and undermining strategic stability. All this hinders collaboration.
I am confident that refocusing the discussion of the updated global development model on concepts such as sovereignty and peoples’ right to adhere to their original path would enable us to reach feasible agreements, and international forums and summits would adopt not only declarations but also binding rules based on the interests of all states and their mutual responsibility.
This should open up fundamentally new opportunities for the entire global community – opportunities for effectively fighting international terrorism and drug trafficking, for ensuring information security, and for removing barriers to trade and technology that are hindering global growth.
What is extremely important – it will help us overcome the enormous inequality in the development of different regions in the world and the migration crisis triggered by that inequality. These are issues facing billions of people on the planet.
The transition of the global economy to a new technological order objectively generates global challenges. In this context, all of us face the need to support sustainable development and guarantee the social and legal protection of individuals.
The duty of all responsible politicians, academics and business people is to comprehend the nature of the technological revolution, the present and the future of the digital age; to coherently and, most importantly, timely deal with such issues as eliminating or smoothing out differences and risks arising during this revolution.
There are many of them. So we need to close the ranks for the sake of using the enormous possibilities offered by technological breakthroughs in various fields in the interests of people.
I would add that digital technology, artificial intelligence, the era of social media and big data will undoubtedly have an impact on politics and parliamentary activity, and on legislative practices; it will open new horizons for expanding direct democracy, direct, interactive participation of citizens in decision-making, and developing legal frameworks from the national to the local level.
In short, new technology can play a huge positive role in enhancing transparency, democratising public and political life, and strengthening democratic institutions – but only if we all keep in mind the most important thing. Digital technology cannot replace freedom; it is the people who are always the source of power. The individual, and their rights, are the backbone and cornerstone of development.
And of course, the most important civilizational task is to protect the planet from environmental and climatic degradation. Speculating on this hot topic, resisting progress, and retracting to outdated and primitive solutions will not help; but finding a real balance between the techno- and the eco-sphere, between nature and human prosperity, quality of life and longevity will.
I believe the parliamentary community has an enormous role to play in consolidating the efforts of countries and peoples for resolving common problems. You possess real, effective levers.
First, legislative regulation has been and will be a basic factor in the world’s ongoing transformations.
Second, you have absolute democratic legitimacy. You are endowed with high authority – to express the will of your nations and, let me repeat, to act and cooperate in the interests of people.
Today, the main mission of parliamentary diplomacy is to promote a unifying constructive agenda, facilitate the harmonisation of economic and humanitarian ties, build up trust between peoples and enhance the responsibility of the world’s parliamentary community for its ability to uphold democratic values.
After all, it is possible to conduct practical and trustworthy dialogue, exchange legislative practices, improve and develop the system of international law only in a sound, strong inter-parliamentary environment.
Your forum fully meets these requirements. Indicatively, your emphases on certain topics and those made at the recent G20 summit and during discussions at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum converge and largely supplement each other.
Promoting sustainable development, making education and healthcare more accessible, strengthening human capital, resolving environmental problems, implementing digitisation and upgrading the labour market are priorities for the entire international community.
These issues may be resolved successfully only in conditions of an open and safe common information space whereby all countries, civil societies and the media are truly interested in disseminating unbiased, honest information and straightforward news.
I know the forum paid special attention to this issue. Let me repeat that consolidation of parliaments in drafting common rules for the exchange of information and its protection are very important for enhancing human rights and freedoms, and establishing and developing a balanced and fair world order.
However, regrettably, we are seeing attempts to monopolise the global information space and misappropriate “the right to the truth.” Incidentally, these trends are expanding at the national level, when some countries actually impose censorship bans and barriers. We believe such bans on a different opinion fundamentally contradict democratic values, the principle of the freedom of speech and, in general, a parliamentary tradition that inherently implies respect for a different opinion or position.
Colleagues,
In conclusion I would like to thank all of you for deeming it important and necessary to attend this forum and discuss the multifaceted issues of inter-parliamentary cooperation based on trust and constructive approaches.
Such respectful and productive cooperation makes a tangible contribution to the consolidation of genuine partnership between our countries and peoples.
Let me wish you success in your work today and your activities at home.
Thank you for your attention.
