President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today, we will discuss plans to develop liquefied natural gas production in our country. As you know, there is a reason that we gathered here, on Yamal. NOVATEK has built the largest LNG plant in Russia on the Yamal Peninsula. As you saw, we have just attended the shipment of the first batch of liquefied natural gas. This grand project required huge investment, $27 billion; it is also multi-profile, as other sectors of the Russian economy are involved in its implementation.
In this sense, we can certainly describe it as a megaproject. It is of great importance for the country as a whole, and is yet another confirmation of Russia’s status as one of the world's leading energy powers.
Yamal LNG opens new horizons for the gas industry’s development, for the entire national economy; it creates high-tech jobs, including in Russia’s North and Far East, where the transhipment terminal will be located. Mr Mikhelson [Chairman of the Management Board of NOVATEK] also talked about this today. This in itself is a separate interesting project, providing work to related enterprises; it lays the groundwork for the effective and balanced development of the Arctic and the Northern Sea Route.
It is also important that this project contributes to strengthening economic cooperation with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, primarily, our key partners in this region, including Chinese companies. We have established successful international cooperation with France, Italy, Germany, and a number of other European states.
Of course, the number of such promising projects needs to be increased. According to experts, global demand for gas will increase by over 40 percent by 2040. It is particularly important that supplies of liquefied gas will be growing faster than any other. Here, growth can reach about 70 percent. Russia can and should occupy a decent niche on this market. Today, as you may be aware, it remains fairly modest.
In addition to Yamal LNG, we have a large gas liquefaction centre on Sakhalin, but, to reiterate, this is clearly not enough. Our fuel and energy complex is faced with the key task of increasing capacities and volumes of LNG production.
In this regard, I would like to emphasise a few points.
First, the production and export of LNG should not lead to weakening of existing positions on the pipeline gas market. Moreover, they need to be retained and, of course, strengthened. The work should be constructed in such a way that the LNG projects do not compete with our pipeline gas. On the contrary, it is necessary to create conditions for balanced, complementary areas of business in order to maximise the return.
Second, the demand for liquefied gas needs to be actively promoted within our country as well.
Its use can be expanded, including through supplying it to remotely located customers without pipeline gas and moving public transport to cleaner and more environmentally friendly natural gas engines. In this sphere, we already have good special programmes.
I hope we will have the chance to talk more about measures to support the consumption of liquefied gas on the domestic market during our today’s meeting.
Third, I would like to emphasise that such projects as Yamal LNG create the foundation for the sustainable development of territories. Here in Sabetta alone it created 32,000 jobs. As Mr Mikhelson said, now the workforce is smaller but there are still tens of thousands of jobs. There is a new port, aviation and railway infrastructure, housing and social facilities. In other words, this is not the predatory, mindless mining of resources but comprehensive development of the territory, accompanied by the implementation of many programmes, including environmental ones. This is exactly the approach that should be used in future LNG projects.
It is also important that Yamal LNG is accompanied by navigation along the Northern Sea Route, the formation of logistics routes, and a build-up of the tanker and icebreaker fleet. I am sure that this will give us unique advantages in the economy, trade and power engineering.
Fourth, obviously to increase LNG supplies it is necessary to develop gas liquefaction capacities and create the conditions for localising the production of equipment essential for its production, storage and transportation, and this creates work for domestic industrial enterprises.
I know that such work is being carried out now. Moreover, it should be carried out quicker so that future LNG projects are based on domestic equipment and technology as much as possible.
And one more point. To diversify the defence industry, I suggest considering the potential participation of defence companies in projects on localising and producing high-tech products for gas companies.
And naturally, in conclusion I would like to wish Yamal LNG success in implementing all of its plans – the second, third and the unexpected fourth line. And, of course, I wish you success in implementing the next phase, Yamal LNG-2.
Thank you. Let’s start the discussion.

Speech at a ceremony of first tanker loading under Yamal LNG project
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
This is a remarkable day for us all. There are no random people here. I congratulate you all, the entire huge team of NOVATEK all those who worked on this project, and all those who have just got on-board and are now working, on this wonderful occasion, the first loading of the gas carrier, a new tanker named after our friend Mr de Margerie. Unfortunately, he is not with us today. He was one of the pioneers of this project, but we have a tanker named after him.
This is an extremely important sector for Russia. This is not just an important event in our country’s energy sector, or gas production and liquefaction. This is a more ambitious project. What I mean is that we are faced with the enormous task of developing the Arctic and the Northern Sea Route.
Someone has already mentioned the number of jobs created across the country – more than 100,000. Over 30,000 people worked here alone during the peak period, and about 30,000 are working now. I just had a chance to talk with the people who work at this facility. They themselves are saying that personnel is one of the key issues. We need to train employees. We had no reason to train them earlier, since we did not possess this competence, and did not work in this area previously.
We do now. This is not only about mineral extraction and building such gas liquefaction plants. It also means further development of nuclear shipbuilding. Just yesterday, during the Security Council meeting, we discussed our further plans for building the nuclear icebreaker fleet. This is yet another competence that we have and that we will further develop and improve, because we need special-class vessels.
Yesterday, we spoke about building such vessels, which are called Leader and which can break ice of any thickness, absolutely any. What does this mean? This means that the Northern Sea Route and an enterprise advantageously located here can operate and ship its goods to consumers across the world all year round.
Even now, the eastward route is open for six to seven months, and the westward route already year round. With the icebreaker fleet, which I just mentioned – and it is being built and gradually put into service, one of the 60 megawatt vessels will be commissioned soon – and later on, with the development of these projects, shipments from here will be possible all year round. This means Russia will develop the sea route in the medium and long term.
All this is interconnected and secures Russia’s future, the future of its economy. This is certainly a complex project, and we have good people here in this room, good professionals, who warned me at the beginning of this journey: “Do not do this.” When asked why – the first, second, third – the reasons they cited were all really serious. But those who started this project took the risk, and the risk proved to be justified, and they achieved success.
This is only the first part of the project, the first phase of a large 16.5 million tonne project. I am confident that the second phase will be implemented ahead of schedule, as early as next year, and most likely, the third phase will also be completed ahead of schedule, also at the end of next year, at the very least in early 2019. And what is especially important, the fourth phase is being planned already, exclusively with Russian technologies.
Now, speaking here before you, I would like to thank our foreign friends and foreign partners (many of them are with us in this room), because without their help, without their trust in their Russian friends and partners, this project would not have happened either. I am referring to both financing and technologies. The project involved companies from the East, from Europe, all of them took an active part in it. And today's shipping, the first shipment, is our common victory. I very much count on them continuing to work together, in this case for the benefit of global energy development.
And I would like to thank the Russian side for their significant contribution through implementing this project, their significant contribution to attaining our major goals for the development of the Arctic as a whole.
Thank you very much. I am sure that this is only the first step in our magnificent joint work.
Thank you.
