President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
By and large, the Security Council of Russia and its regular meetings prepare strategic planning documents in a variety of spheres. But today we will talk about foreign policy, an area of the Security Council’s direct responsibility.
The Foreign Ministry has prepared an updated draft of the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation. It is certainly a strategic planning document. The Foreign Ministry took into account the recent global changes, including changes that took place in international politics over the past five years.
The report will be delivered by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Let us proceed.
