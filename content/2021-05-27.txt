Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu presents the Armed Forces Museum project at Patriot Park.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu
: Mr President, you approved the construction of the Armed Forces’ Main Cathedral, and now we are presenting a large project for a major museum of the Armed Forces.
Of course, we have one in Moscow. We are building this one so that some 740,000 items that are in storage at various museums could be…
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Exhibited.
Sergei Shoigu: Exhibited for our people, for our compatriots to see.
This building will be unique because we plan to establish something like a historical theatre in each wing, for example, the Battle of Borodino here.
There will be artifacts, redoubts, weapons, cannons, uniforms and flags: everything that we keep in storage today will be presented. We have 43,000 items of small arms from different wars alone.
This is why we would like to ask you to support this initiative. It would be the largest museum: almost 150,000 square metres.
Vladimir Putin: What a beautiful model. Is this a star?
Sergei Shoigu: Yes, Mr President, stars. These stars will overlap each other, and of course, here they will be presented at different levels.
In addition to this, there will not be just a passage here but also a weapons exhibition. We show this simply to see the scale of the building. And, of course, here we have heavy equipment, aircraft, and many other things, like we did next to the Main Cathedral of the Armed Forces: we have a similar battle installation there.
And here, the exhibition will change, for example, once a season or every six months. For example, the Battle of Stalingrad here and the Defence of Brest Fortress there.
In order to do this, we will set up workshops that will change the exhibits every six months, and people will visit and say like in a theatre: tonight, there will be this show. Not even a show, but an exhibition of historical events of the time, such as World War I, or the Battle of Kulikovo, or many other events.
Vladimir Putin: A live museum.
Sergei Shoigu: Yes, Mr President, a live museum.

An analysis of armed conflicts of the past few decades and the experience of the development of the world’s leading armies show the growing role of the effective use of, say, cruise missiles with different platform bases, as well as guided munitions. It is important to provide our Army and Navy with an adequate number of precision weapons of this kind.
Now our troops have received or are receiving the latest Х-101 and Calibre long-range cruise missiles, ballistic and cruise missiles of the Iskander tactical systems, multiple launch rocket systems and guided air bombs of different calibers.
In terms of specifications, they are not inferior to their foreign counterparts. Moreover, they are often superior to them and unique in some specifications. This has been confirmed in combat as well – during the anti-terrorist operations in Syria.
It is important to maintain the necessary production rate of contemporary strike weapons for their use and combat training.
Colleagues, I would like to hear from you what organisational and economic decisions would allow for dealing with this task in the most efficient way and also about the preparedness of defence industry enterprises for the serial production of the most advanced weapons.
The second issue is the development of the military transport aviation of the Aerospace Forces. I want to note that its consolidated operation and the fleet’s readiness defines its capability to move troops promptly over great distances. For our country, the largest country in the world, it is especially important that our army can be compact but efficient. It is also important for holding successful landing operations.
It is obvious that our Armed Forces need to have enough military and transport aircraft and heavy helicopters. There are certain achievements and groundwork in this area.
Thus, the technical serviceability of An-124 strategic airlifts is being maintained with the use of Russian-made components. The state trials of the Il-112V light military transport aircraft are being concluded; in 2021, plans call for delivering two such planes. The production of Il-76 is being resumed on a new technological base. The army will receive five Il-76MD-90As before the end of the year.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the Defence Ministry requires many more military transport aircraft and helicopters.
Let us discuss today how to solve this problem, outline measures to boost production and modernise the military transport industry.
Let us get down to business.
