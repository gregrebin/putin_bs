Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon respected colleagues,
We are holding the first session of the Council for the Fight against Corruption today. And I would like to describe its tasks in more detail.
Many countries, to some or other extent, have to deal with the problem of corruption. And a certain practice has already been worked out, while great experience in targeted anti-corruption policies has been accumulated. Entire systems to counteract this evil are in place.
The main form of corruption in Russia today is bribery. Meanwhile, corruption as a social manifestation is a far more complicated matter. Its consequences extremely negatively affect the most diverse spheres of state and public life, from the economy to morals.
It is obvious that corruption is closely linked with various forms of abuse of power. Moreover, this occurs at all levels. This comes in the form of all sorts of preferences for so-called close businessmen and the creation of extra-legal advantages when receiving state services and much more.
In essence, this means actions that lead to violations of equality and the very freedom of economic activity. They lead to the state failing to fulfil its obligations to guarantee honest competition.
As a result, citizens’ legal rights are violated, the economy’s normal development is held back and serious barriers emerge in the way of economic growth.
In general, corruption demoralises society, while it damages the authorities and the state apparatus. It is particularly unacceptable in judicial and law enforcement practice, in judicial and law enforcement bodies, for whom the fight against corruption is a primary function.
I believe that the main task of the council, as a consultative body, is to identify the reasons for and the conditions in which corruption spreads. And this is the basis for drawing up a systemic anti-corruption policy. This should be a policy that is reflected in both current legislation and in the organisation of enforcement proceedings.
I would like to stress once again: the roots of corruption lie in the very flaws of the organisation of the state’s economic and administrative life. Poor quality legislation cultivates these roots, while they spread due to the lack of effective control over the activity of officials, and bodies of state and municipal power.
As you know, the authorities in Russia have repeatedly and forcefully declared that corruption needs to be dealt with. Entire programmes have been drawn up, while individual, quite tough measures have been taken. However, I should say directly that they have not, unfortunately, had much effect.
The scale of this problem will only be reduced when the country sees the law, its institutions of democracy and the civilised market strengthened. And when the authorities will not only fight with the consequences of corruption, but also its causes.
Accordingly, I would like to set out the main priorities that, in my view, form the basis of our joint work.
Firstly, constant and systemic anti-corruption expert studies have to be conducted with regard to legislation. This applies to both articles that could lead to abuse and the very possibility of corruption in current laws and bills being prepared. The legal field has to be cleared of empty declarations, dual interpretations and internal contradictions. Laws should only include clear and realistic demands, as well as comprehensible mechanisms for their application.
Secondly, the council will have to become involved in work to analyse the activity of federal, regional and local bodies of power. I would like to emphasise that this does not mean interfering in the work of local authorities. I am speaking about analysing their activity. You know that the relevant commission has already been set up, whose results should not only influence the course of administrative reforms. I should reiterate that we have delayed this process, but also the definition of an anti-corruption component part of the state policy.
The execution of any administrative procedures should be as transparent as possible. Bodies of power have to part once and for all with the traditions of making state and municipal decisions outside the limits of budgetary and taxation legislation. And the budget and extra-budget funds established by the law must become the only way to receive and allocate money for the authorities.
The third area of our activity is the improvement of the state and municipal apparatus, the tough regulation of officials’ rights and obligations. A task connected with this is the creation of a working mechanism to settle conflicts of interests of state and municipal service officials. They need to be put within strict procedural limits, while the results of their work must be open to civil society, to people, in essence, taxpayers, who pay for the services of the state apparatus from their own pockets.
We should not be afraid, in my opinion, of improving the material situation, raising the wages of officials, but their activity should be transparent, open and absolutely understandable for society.
The council will have to form working commissions featuring specialists who know the problem and have great authority in the professional and public sphere.
The council should possess objective information about the scale of corruption and in which areas it has become the most entrenched. It should rely on clear legal criteria and appraisals. We must provide an exact definition of the very notion of “corruption” and understand what facilitates it in today’s conditions.
And, finally, my last point. The more effective and stronger the institutions of civil control are, the fewer chances to abuse power in the interests of personal and collective gain there will be. And, therefore, one of the council’s tasks is to work out effective forms of public control over state and municipal authorities.
We have already raised this subject repeatedly, but effectively working mechanisms of control have so far not been established. I would suggest that the council should put forward its own specific proposals in the form of legislative initiatives of the Government and the President of the Russian Federation.
In conclusion, I shall add that the period of the organisational formation of the council must be completed as soon as possible, including with regard to its expert and working mechanisms. Empty talk, any fuss or form of “campaigning” is totally unnecessary in this sphere and they must be consigned to the past.
On the contrary, precise and realistic measures are needed both to deal with instances of corruption and, most importantly, to prevent them. To fulfil this task and form, as I have already said, working bodies quickly, I propose that we appoint the council’s chairman today. I know that some of my colleagues are of the opinion that the chair should rotate for a period of six months. I agree with them. We shall do this. I propose that the council’s chairman for the first six months be Chairman of the Russian Federation Government Mikhail Kasyanov. If there are no objections, then let’s do this.
Now let’s talks about the formation of the two working commissions and determine who will chair them.
