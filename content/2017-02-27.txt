Meeting with President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon.
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon: Mr Putin,
I wish you a warm welcome to Tajikistan and I am grateful to you for accepting our invitation to make this official visit to our country.
Tajikistan’s relations with Russia hold a special place among our foreign policy priorities. Russia is our key strategic partner and all areas of cooperation with Russia are important to us. I am sure that your visit will give new impetus to developing our bilateral relations.
Welcome!
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Rahmon.
Let me start by passing on the greetings of President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, with whom I met just before.
Emomali Rahmon: Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: This year, we are marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. Tajikistan is one of our most important partners in the region. We are happy to see that Russia is Tajikistan’s biggest trading partner.
We have already carried out big projects and we have good plans ahead. We are bound by long years of cooperation and friendship, and we truly consider Tajikistan to be our strategic partner.
We agreed during our last meeting in St Petersburg that I would come to Tajikistan on this visit. I am sure that this will give us the chance to discuss many matters concerning our bilateral relations and the situation in the region.
Tajikistan’s position on regional issues is of great importance for Russia. In this sense, I consider Tajikistan a key country for maintaining security and stability in the region.
As we know, Russia has a military base here in Tajikistan, the purpose of which is to guarantee Tajikistan’s security, and that of Russia’s southern borders.
Our colleagues will discuss matters with each other and go over all areas of our relations. Thank you very much for the invitation.
You know of our decision to present a Russian Federation state decoration to you. It is my pleasure to do so now. I congratulate you most sincerely and thank you for all you are doing to develop the relations between our countries.
Emomali Rahmon: Thank you very much.
Presentation of state decoration to the President of Tajikistan
Emomali Rahmon: Thank you, Mr Putin.
It is a great honour to receive this high Russian Federation decoration. I express my sincere gratitude for this assessment of our work to strengthen the strategic partnership between our countries.
Vladimir Putin: For my part, I want to thank you once more for all you are doing to bolster our bilateral relations.
Emomali Rahmon: Thank you.
Presentation of state decoration to Tajikistan’s Foreign Minister
Vladimir Putin: We work together very closely on the international stage. As the diplomats say, we share very close or similar approaches. This truly is the case. Thank you for supporting Russia’s initiatives.
Mr Rahmon, let me assure you that we will also do all we can to support Tajikistan on the international stage.

Press statements following Russian-Tajikistani talks.
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Ladies and gentlemen,
Our work today was constructive and fruitful, and we signed a number of bilateral cooperation agreements. It is symbolic that Mr Putin’s visit takes place as we mark the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. I am sure that this visit will give a new boost to dynamic and harmonious development of our relations in all different areas.
Russia was and is Tajikistan’s key strategic partner in all areas. As guarantor of the peace agreement, Russia played an important part in restoring peace and harmony to Tajikistan, and made a big contribution to Tajikistan’s socioeconomic development, and strengthening its national independence.
Over the years since independence, cooperation with Russia has developed dynamically in all important areas of life. The legal base for our relations now counts around 260 documents that cover practically all areas of cooperation, from military-technical cooperation to big socioeconomic projects.
The summit meeting today confirmed once again the high level of political trust, which we value very highly. Both countries give a high assessment of our level of relations and agree that there is much potential that could be put to use to develop them further.

Russian-Tajikistani talks
February 27, 2017
We expressed our mutual desire to continue our on-going political dialogue, which helps us to optimise our cooperation in all areas. We looked in detail at the situation with and prospects for cooperation on our bilateral relations and within international organisations such as the UN, SCO
, CIS
, and CSTO
.
Expanding interregional cooperation is very important for adding new substance and content to our economic ties and deepening our existing ties in this area. We reaffirmed our readiness to continue working together in important economic sectors such as agriculture, textiles, mining, and energy, including the oil and gas sector.
We affirmed our readiness to increase supplies of environmentally healthy fruit and vegetables on the Russian market. We agree that the intergovernmental commission on economic cooperation plays a key part in resolving the tasks before us today.
We have discussed labour migration issues. We hope that the Tajikistani side’s initiatives in this regard will be supported by the Russian Government.
We decided to take a number of efficient measures in the cultural and humanitarian, including educational, fields. In this context, we noted the importance of creating favourable conditions to meet the growing interest of Tajikistan citizens in receiving education in Russian.
Today, there are branches of three Russian universities in Tajikistan, and over 20,000 Tajikistani citizens study at Russian universities, including under quotas annually allocated by Russia.
We are grateful to the Russian Government for the decision to increase the number of quotas for students from Tajikistan in the academic year. Other priorities are the construction of new secondary schools in Tajikistan with Russian-language lessons and providing our educational institutions with teachers of Russian, textbooks and manuals.
During the discussion of international issues, special attention was paid to cooperation in the fight against terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking and other forms of transnational organised crime. We noted the efficient and fruitful cooperation of law enforcement agencies and agreed to further coordinate our efforts in this regard.
As we all know, Tajikistan accounts for about 60 percent of the Commonwealth’s external borders with Afghanistan. Our country is an outpost on this line, and this imposes on us a great responsibility to respond adequately and prevent any emerging threats and challenges. In this regard, we paid particular attention to the situation in Afghanistan and expressed our shared view of the extreme importance of establishing peace and stability in this neighbouring country.
Mutual desire to develop military and military-technical cooperation was expressed, primarily through upgrading the Armed Forces of Tajikistan in order to strengthen our country’s defence capability and ensure regional security.
In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the President of Russia, Mr Putin, for awarding the high state decoration of the Russian Federation – the Order of Alexander Nevsky. I take this decoration as a symbol of great appreciation for the Tajikistani people’s contribution to the development and strengthening of friendly relations with brotherly Russia.
I am pleased to give the floor to Mr Putin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon, ladies and gentlemen, friends,
My talks with the President of Tajikistan took place, as always, in a friendly and warm atmosphere. Meeting first in narrow format, we discussed in detail practically all areas of our cooperation, and then continued these discussions with the heads of our ministries and agencies.
I want to emphasise that Tajikistan is Russia’s reliable ally and strategic partner. Our countries share friendly ties that have stood the test of time. In April this year, as has been noted several times during this visit, we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.
The President of Tajikistan has made a big personal contribution to strengthening our bilateral cooperation. In recognition of these particular services, it was with great pleasure that I presented to Mr Rahmon today a high Russian Federation state decoration, the Order of Alexander Nevsky. As you know, Tajikistan’s foreign minister was awarded the Order of Friendship
.
We gave priority attention to expanding our trade and economic partnership during the talks today. Russia is Tajikistan’s biggest foreign trade partner. Our country covers close to Tajikistan’s entire demand for petroleum products.
Unfortunately, the unstable global economic situation in recent years, price fluctuations for raw materials, and volatile exchange rates, have meant that trade turnover has dropped somewhat in value terms, though it remains practically unchanged in terms of actual volume.
We have been working on putting in place new conditions for developing our trade and economic ties, because we cannot be satisfied with the current situation, of course.
The intergovernmental commission, which is working energetically and quite effectively, plays a key part in resolving our economic development tasks and promoting trade and economic ties. Russia is a leading investor in Tajikistan’s economy. Our companies have invested more than $1.6 billion in Tajikistan.
We have big projects in the energy sector. The Sangtuda hydroelectric power plant, which was built with Russian help, generates 12 percent of Tajikistan’s electricity today and can supply electricity to other countries.
The intergovernmental agreement on cooperation on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, signed today, opens up new opportunities for work together in this important area. Let me say right away that this will make it possible to resolve environmental problems, above all.
There are good prospects for expanding our mutually advantageous cooperation in agriculture. Russia seeks to increase imports of agricultural produce from Tajikistan. Russian Railways
last year set a preferential tariff for transport of agricultural produce, in order to help Tajikistan’s producers send their produce to Russia, and is ready to continue this practice.
We had a constructive discussion of our interregional ties, an area we consider very important. Practically all of Russia’s regions work with partners in Tajikistan.
Tajikistan’s economy receives substantial support in the form of the remittances sent home by Tajikistani citizens working in Russia. An estimated 876,000 Tajikistani citizens work in Russia, and last year alone, they sent home more than $1.9 billion, which is close to a third of Tajikistan’s GDP.
Let me stress that Tajikistani citizens in Russia benefit from maximum preferential conditions. They can spend 15 days in Russia without needing to register, and can obtain a work patent for a three-year period. We do all we can to ensure that they have decent living and working conditions and guaranteed social protection and medical care.
The bilateral agreement on cooperation on labour and employment matters builds on our ties in this area. The President of Tajikistan raised other issues in this area, including the question of people, who for whatever reason, have been prohibited from entering the Russian Federation. We discussed this situation. Overall, we have found a solution and will work with the President of Tajikistan in line with the agreement reached.
Our contacts in education, science and culture are all at a good level. More than 21,000 students from Tajikistan are studying at Russian universities, half of them at Russian government expense. This year, we decided to increase the number of Russian state scholarships accorded to students from Tajikistan.
I want to note how much effort Mr Rahmon puts into maintaining and developing the Russian language. We place great importance on this and value it very much. We agreed today to take further steps to pursue joint work in this area, including by developing a network of schools where teaching is conducted in Russian.
The Russian-Tajikistani (Slavic) University is working with success in Dushanbe and has more than 6,000 students. The branches that Moscow State University
, the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys, and the Moscow Power Engineering Institute have opened in Tajikistan are also working well.
We had a useful exchange of views on the biggest issues on the international and regional agendas. It is pleasing to see that our positions coincide on most issues. In particular, we discussed the problematic situation in Afghanistan, and both countries support raid efforts to achieve national reconciliation in Afghanistan, and stated their readiness to provide Kabul with all possible assistance in advancing the negotiation process.
Russia and Tajikistan share concern over terrorist groups such as Islamic State spreading their influence in Afghanistan. We are concerned by the rapid increase in drug trafficking and cross-border crime. In this respect, we agreed to step up our joint efforts to protect the Tajik-Afghan border, including by making use of the possibilities offered by the Russian military base in Tajikistan.
We agreed to continue the priority attention we give to cooperation within important organisations such as the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO, and to continue our work together in this area.
In conclusion, let me thank Mr Rahmon for the warm and very hospitable welcome, and for the substantive and productive talks. I am sure that the agreements we reached during this visit will help to develop our economic cooperation in the interests of both countries’ peoples.
Thank you for your attention.

Meeting with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
Vladimir Putin had talks with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev while on a working visit to Kazakhstan.

Almaty

With President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
Bilateral cooperation and key issues on the international agenda were the main subjects of discussion. The two presidents noted, in particular, the need to develop additional joint cooperation projects, in line with the instructions given to the two countries’ deputy prime ministers. Mr Putin and Mr Nazarbayev also examined in detail issues related to the Eurasian Economic Union
.
Mr Putin also thanked Mr Nazarbayev for organising the inter-Syrian talks in Astana.
* * *
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Kazakhstan. It is our tradition to meet at the start of the year to set our watches and outline our plans and our work together.
Over the 25 years that we have been implementing our basic treaty on friendship and cooperation, a document created for the 21st century, I think that we have built the kind of model relations that countries that are good friends and neighbours should have.
This year, we are set to mark the 25th anniversary of our diplomatic relations too. Our foreign ministries will mark this occasion, which we welcome as an important milestone in our cooperation.
Our close cooperation has enabled us to establish the Eurasian Economic Union. There is no getting away from the fact that circumstances have had an impact, of course, but I think that this undertaking is a promising and important project that will benefit all member countries.
Today, 7,000 Russian companies are present in Kazakhstan and are opening a huge number of processing facilities there. During your visit last autumn and the big business forum that took place in St Petersburg, we signed 41 contracts for a total of $3 billion. This keeps Russia in place as Kazakhstan’s top partner, whether in politics or in the economy.
We share the same approach with regard to the international agenda. Kazakhstan is currently a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. With Russia’s support, we will resolve the common tasks ahead.
Russia is currently engaged in important international undertakings, particularly your involvement in the Syrian process and the proposal to hold several rounds of talks in Astana.
Talks are underway in Geneva today. Yesterday was a day off, but today, they will sit down to talk. The process has begun, in other words, and this is very important.
We have the chance now to discuss some of the issues on our agenda. We have a series of meetings ahead this year. I know that you have agreed to China’s One Belt One Road initiative, a conference on which will take place in China in April. Then there is the SCO
summit on June 8 in Kazakhstan, along with the opening of the EXPO 2017 world exhibition. Our annual interregional conference will take place in autumn. We therefore have many opportunities for meeting to discuss and resolve current issues.
Let me say that our delegation has no issues to raise with the Russian delegation. The delegations met just earlier and discussed everything. All current matters are settled in friendly spirit and I see no problems.
We can move ahead on establishing joint industrial ventures in the processing sector, agriculture, the defence industry, and at Baikonur
. We will settle all issues, including, most importantly, those that come up within the EAEU.
I wish you welcome, Mr Putin, and I wish you success.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for the invitation. We have had regular meetings since the start of the year, and in general, we have a busy programme of work and meetings.
I would like to start this meeting by expressing our gratitude for your efforts to organise the inter-Syrian talks in Astana. I know that Kazakhstan played a very positive role in this, not just as the host country and organiser, but also through its influence, which made it possible to produce some very positive results from the two rounds of talks organised in Astana.
I know that you personally took part in this, worked with the delegations’ participants, and were instrumental in bringing these talks to a productive close. The talks produced progress in the form of a new ceasefire mechanism, and this is the biggest achievement really, as it laid a foundation that made it possible to continue the Geneva talks you just mentioned.
Regarding our bilateral relations, our economic ties are the foundation here. Kazakhstan is one of Russia’s key economic partners in the region, and you spoke of this too.
It is true that our trade turnover has dropped somewhat in value terms. As we discussed, this is linked to the exchange rate difference, particularly the price fluctuations on the global markets for our main export goods. But in terms of physical volume, our trade turnover remains at its previous level.
Our task is to increase the physical volume and achieve sustainable growth. This is all the more possible now that our integration efforts have put the needed conditions in place. The Eurasian Bank is working well now.
The bank has already approved a project worth several billion dollars for Kazakhstan. I think this is a good sign and gives us reason to be confident that our economic relations will continue to develop.
As for our foreign policy work, we count very much on the support of Kazakhstan, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, in resolving global problems. Our integration work continues as planned.
Of course, as in any undertaking, there are difficulties and problems that require attention from our countries’ leaders, and I hope that we will discuss all of these matters during our meeting today.
Thank you very much.

Beginning of Russian-Tajikistani talks in expanded format
February 27, 2017

Dushanbe
Russian-Tajikistani talks.
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: You bestowed on me a high Russian Federation state decoration, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, just before. I consider this particular significant this year, as we mark the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. I express my sincere gratitude for this high assessment of our contribution to strengthening our bilateral relations and strategic partnership.
Mr Putin, friends,
This official visit by the Russian President to Tajikistan is without any exaggeration an important milestone in developing our countries’ relations, and a good opportunity to discuss current bilateral cooperation and exchange views on the regional and international issues on the agenda today.
We seek to further strengthen our strategic partnership with Russia, a country close to us in all areas. I am sure that both countries share this desire, which is in our common interest.
It is with pleasure that I give you the floor, Mr Putin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for the kind words and for the invitation to make this official visit to Tajikistan, a country that is our friend and with which we have worked together for many years. This year, we celebrate the 25th anniversary of our diplomatic relations with independent Tajikistan.
Tajikistan was and remains our important ally and strategic partner in all respects. We place great importance on Tajikistan’s work and your personal efforts to ensure stability in the region.
Of course, trade and economic ties are of crucial importance. As I said before at the meeting in narrow format, we have already carried out big projects and we want to continue our work.
We want to continue our efforts not just on big projects, but in all different areas, including small and medium-sized business, and develop interstate ties at the personal, human level.
At our past meetings, and today too, at the narrow format meeting, you always come back to the question of humanitarian cooperation, which I think is extremely important, particularly in education.
We will certainly examine your proposal to continue expanding cooperation in education, and not just at the higher education level, but at the school level too. As was noted just before, 21,000 students from Tajikistan are studying at Russian universities, and 10,000 of them are doing so at Russian government expense.
Defence and security ties are another aspect of our cooperation. Tajikistan is home to a Russian military base. I want to thank you for the attention you give to this area of our cooperation and for the assistance you give to our base’s operation. I have no doubt at all that this is also an important factor for stability and security in the region, including in Tajikistan itself.
Thank you very much for the invitation. I hope that we will look in detail at these various cooperation areas in this expanded format now.
