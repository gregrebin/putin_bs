With Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kadyrov, as far as I understand, the operation is complete.
Head of The Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov
: Yes, Mr President, it is complete. We have eliminated all ten bandits. All their bodies have been found. Unfortunately, it was not without losses. But the intentions of the bandits, their plans were foiled thanks to our colleagues.
We already provided assistance, initial help, to families so that they can bury their sons. And the necessary assistance has been provided to the injured. Moreover, the buildings that have been destroyed are already being rebuilt: a school and the Printing House. The operation is completed, but we will work on ensuring that we are not ashamed in front of the people of the Russian Federation, in front of you. It is truly uncomfortable, we have such an event today, and suddenly, the Chechen Republic almost ruined it.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Kadyrov, you have nothing to be ashamed of, because you personally and your colleagues acted swiftly and professionally. So I want to express gratitude for this to you and to all law enforcement staff in the Chechen Republic; thank you very much. But, of course, I want to send special words of gratitude to law enforcement agents. The Chechen Republic’s law enforcement agencies have not only matured but also become professional. And staff members who met these bandits demonstrated themselves to be true professionals and heroes.
As usual, as we all know, the criminals are essentially acting from a corner, shooting people in the back. Who did they attack? They did not attack your special units that are fighting terrorism; they attacked the highway patrol, people who simply protect order on the roads, ensuring the normal function of transport – that’s who they attacked. And in essence, they killed people from a corner.
But I am confident that Chechnya’s law enforcement agencies will adequately assess the situation and react professionally to all such events, as happened now. We will never forget the names of the comrades who perished, the names of the heroes, and we will need to provide all the necessary help to the bereaved families. And we must support the injured. You have already said that the first steps have been taken. I know that you are treating this carefully and I am asking you to bring this work to a close.
Ramzan Kadyrov: Absolutely, Mr President. Thank you.
