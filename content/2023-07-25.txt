Video address on Investigation Officers’ Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers,
I would like to congratulate all current staff and veterans of investigative bodies to your professional holiday.
First, I would like to thank you for your service to the Fatherland and the people of Russia.
Working as an investigator means being on the side of the law and justice, waging a fierce battle against corruption, extremism and terrorism, exposing criminals, preventing arbitrary actions and the persecution of innocent people, and defending the rights of those who have suffered at the hands of criminals.
This job requires a special professional grasp, strong character, moral backbone, deep and diverse knowledge, readiness to withstand a high level of psychological stress and act under any, even the most complicated circumstances, in a principled, responsible way, sometimes at the risk of one’s life.
This is exactly how preliminary investigation bodies are now working in the new regions of our country – Novorossiya and Donbass, facilitating their integration into Russia’s common legal space and protecting constitutional order and law.
It is necessary to continue system-wide work on investigating crimes by punitive squads, foreign mercenaries and neo-Nazis, and acts of terror against civilians, government officials, public figures and journalists.
I am sure you understand the importance of this task as well as of many other key areas of activity related to investigating crimes against people’s lives and health, against property, national and public interests.
I know I can count on you to keep doing the daily work needed to ensure the supremacy of law and, hence, the sustainable, stable development of our entire country, strengthening of its security and sovereignty.
I want to thank you for your honesty and commitment, and, of course, for your loyalty to the best traditions of your profession, which took centuries to develop and are now enjoying their due historical continuity through your work.
I wish you good health and success, and happiness to your families and friends.
Happy holiday!
