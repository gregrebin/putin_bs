President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev,
I am in the happy situation today of not having to describe the state of our relations. You are one of the initiators of the integration that has been taking place in the post-Soviet area and one of the people behind the creation of the Eurasian Economic Community and the Customs Union
. The idea of the Eurasian Union, which I hope we will see realised in the future, also belongs to you. 
I remember very clearly the time we met here in Moscow with your Prime Minister and some other colleagues a few years ago, and he brought with him your message on the need to establish the Customs Union. We started moving in precisely that direction in our integration efforts. I am very pleased that our common plans and ideas have been brought into fruition as real acts and that we now have an excellent springboard from which to keep moving further.
I am very pleased to see you and welcome you to Moscow. I am sure that we will continue to act and to move in this direction.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Thank you.
We are meeting today a week since your inauguration took place. Once more, I congratulate you and wish you success.
We are strategic allies, close neighbours and partners. I think that the relations between Russia and Kazakhstan set an example throughout the post-Soviet area of how close relations can develop.
The Customs Union has already produced results and we now have a trade turnover of $25 billion. Russia is one of our biggest trade partners. Our regional cooperation is developing too. In September, we will meet in Pavlodar, as agreed, given that our regions that share common borders account for 70 percent of our trade. 
We have CIS
and CSTO
events taking place today. The CIS gave birth to the Eurasian Economic Community
, which in turn produced the Customs Union. We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to the CIS, which, for all the different aspects and circumstances within it, poses no obstacle to anyone in any way.
Thank you for today’s meeting. I think that we will have the chance to discuss business matters at our later meetings. In any case, there are no big unresolved issues between us.
We have been following your first decisions and orders. Russia is turning its attention to Siberia. This is very good and this kind of development and effort is something that was long needed.
I recall the Soviet years, when, as head of Kazakhstan’s government I was a member of the Soviet government. Before construction of the BAM railway began we heard from Chairman of Gosplan [Soviet state planning agency] Nikolai Baibakov on how much natural wealth lies along this route and how many new cities would be built. All of the different Soviet republics took part in this construction effort, some building a section of the line, some building a station. We built the Chara station. But then the work fizzled out and came to a standstill. If this could all be revived again and put to Russia’s use it would indeed be a great endeavour. I wish you the greatest success.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
Aside from our joint integration projects, we also have good plans for our bilateral ties. We have, for example, the Joint Action Plan, which is essentially the roadmap for our relations’ development.
Nursultan Nazarbayev: Most important is that on May 25, we will mark the 20th anniversary of our fundamental agreement, the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. Some of its provisions are now outdated, left behind now that we have created the Customs Union. I hope we will address this matter, make the necessary amendments and extend the agreement. I therefore invite you to come and visit me in Kazakhstan.
Vladimir Putin: It is an offer I accept with pleasure.

Meeting of heads of CSTO member states
May 15, 2012
14:45
The Kremlin, Moscow
At the meeting of heads of states parties to the Collective Security Treaty.
President OF RUSSIA VLADIMIR PUTIN: Good afternoon, friends and colleagues,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Moscow to the anniversary session of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 10th anniversary of CSTO. I sincerely congratulate you on this significant milestone.
Today we will review CSTO’s main achievements over a 10-year period. I believe that our organisation has proved itself worthy. CSTO has strengthened and matured in recent years, its international prestige has grown and it has become one of the most effective tools for maintaining collective security in its area of responsibility. It is important that we do not stop there. We must optimise a number of CSTO activities to achieve greater coordination of our actions in the international arena.
”Our organisation has proved itself worthy. CSTO has strengthened and matured in recent years, its international prestige has grown and it has become one of the most effective tools for maintaining collective security. It is important that we do not stop there.“
In accordance with the established practice, I propose that we exchange views on international issues and further steps to combat global and regional challenges and threats. I am pleased to give the floor to Mr Nazarbayev, who is chairing the CSTO meeting today.
Mr Nazarbayev has the floor.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Thank you.
Good afternoon, colleagues,
First of all, on behalf of everyone present here I would like to express our gratitude to the Russian party and to Mr Putin personally for the excellent organisation of the Collective Security Council’s anniversary meeting and for the traditional hospitality.
We congratulate you on winning the presidential election and taking office, as well as the 67th anniversary of the Great Victory, which we all celebrated.
Colleagues, I propose we continue our meeting. I hope that today, in line with the established tradition, we will exchange views on topical issues in a confidential setting and adopt a number of decisions with regard to our organisation.

Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President, in accordance with the Federal Constitutional Law On the Government [of the Russian Federation] and in line with our agreement, I have held the necessary consultations, which resulted in a draft Executive Order of the President of the Russian Federation on the structure of federal executive bodies. It has been completed, and I as Prime Minister have signed it. I can submit it to you for consideration in line with the established procedure.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. What about the Government composition?
Dmitry Medvedev: We will not make the composition public so as not to stir up excessive interest. I have also held consultations with all the candidates to the Government and would like to submit to you the list of candidates so that you can continue consultations with them.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I will look at the draft executive order on the structure, sign it and begin consultations with all the candidates for the posts of federal ministers you propose.

Speeches at the expanded meeting of CSTO Collective Security Council

CSTO Collective Security Council meeting in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues and friends,
I am happy to greet you here in Moscow at the anniversary meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 10th anniversary of our organisation. Congratulations to all of you on this momentous occasion.
We have just held a meeting of the Collective Security Council in a restricted format, where we had a very frank exchange of views on current international issues, identified our further joint efforts to counter global and regional challenges and threats, and shared our analysis of the situation in the world and in international security.
I would like to note that our approaches to the main issues of international and regional security are very close. I am confident that CSTO’s role in the world will continue to grow.
I am pleased to give the floor to President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, who holds the presidency in the organisation this year.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
First of all, on behalf of all CSTO members I would like to express our gratitude to the Russian side and personally to President of Russia Vladimir Putin for the excellent organisation of the anniversary meeting of the Collective Security Council and the traditional hospitality. Mr Putin, I would like to once again congratulate you on your victory in the presidential election and on taking office, and to wish you success and all the best to the Russian people.
“We had a very frank exchange of views on current international issues, identified our further joint efforts to counter global and regional challenges. Our approaches to the main issues of international and regional security are very close.”
Esteemed members of the Collective Security Council, participants in the meeting,
I propose that we continue our meeting in an expanded format. At the restricted attendance meeting of the Collective Security Council we exchanged views on current global and regional security issues. As always, according to tradition, our discussion was very frank and trust-based. I believe it will be useful for our organisation and for the relations between our countries.
We also talked about boosting our collective measures in the field of security, including combating modern threats and challenges, primarily those emanating from Afghanistan. In addition, we reviewed the situation in the Middle East, Western Asia and North Africa, including the developments in Syria and the Iranian nuclear issue.
Following the restricted format meeting we adopted the Declaration of CSTO member states, which covers a wide range of international security issues that are in one way or another connected with the security of CSTO member states. The Declaration also provides a realistic assessment of the organisation’s activities since its inception.
Friends,
Today we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 10th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. In this regard, the central theme of the expanded format meeting should be CSTO’s main achievements in the period from 2002 to 2012, and priority areas of the organisation’s development.

Meeting with President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
Vladimir Putin and Emomali Rahmon discussed prospects for developing bilateral relations.
May 15, 2012
18:50
The Kremlin, Moscow
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the informal Commonwealth of Independent States summit.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon, colleagues,
I am very happy for the opportunity to meet with you – within the framework of our integration organisations and the event we are holding to address these matters – and talk about our bilateral issues.
You know, something I have noticed recently which makes me happy is that in addition to developing our relations in many different areas (not only the economy, but military cooperation as well: we have a full-fledged base functioning in Tajikistan, and I am very grateful to you for your support of its work), our relations are also developing nicely on a regional level. More than 70 of Russia’s federal constituent entities maintain relations with their partners and colleagues in Tajikistan. And when relations reach that level, it speaks to the fact that the mutual interest is becoming substantial and fundamental. We have a good foundation for diversifying all our relations, and I am certain that is exactly what will happen.
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Mr Putin, I am genuinely happy for the opportunity to meet with you.
I will take this opportunity to once again congratulate you on taking office as President of the Russian Federation.
“More than 70 of Russia’s federal constituent entities maintain relations with their partners and colleagues in Tajikistan. It speaks to the fact that the mutual interest is becoming substantial and fundamental.”
I agree with your statements and would like to add that in the last four years, despite the economic and financial crises, turnover between our nations has been increasing by an average of 10–15 per cent.
Our relations are also developing very well in the humanitarian sector: just a few days ago, we opened the second branch of one of Moscow’s higher education institutions, and a third branch will be opened this year.
Cooperation with Russia’s regions is indeed developing dynamically. Your representatives frequently visit us and our regions’ representatives visit your nation. But it is true that many untapped opportunities still remain.
We recently met – Russia’s Foreign Minister visited us – and discussed cooperation in greater detail. I want to say again that there are basically no complicated, unresolved issues between our nations.
You rightly noted that there is a military base, which exists and is operating. So far, we don’t have any problems; “Okno” [the opto-electric space surveillance station] is working well, as are other facilities on the territory of Tajikistan.
We are working quite well in the quadrilateral format within the regional integration process in the South Asian region – I am referring to Russia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. This year, we are scheduled to meet in Islamabad in September.
Overall, there are some issues that we must resolve after careful consideration, under mutually acceptable conditions, while taking into account the interests of each side. We need to negotiate and reach agreements, and we need to do that very seriously. I stated in my address and want to reiterate that in Tajikistan, we have always treated the interests of our strategic partner, the Russian Federation, with understanding and great respect. I feel that Russia must also respect the interests of its ally.
Vladimir Putin: We certainly will.
