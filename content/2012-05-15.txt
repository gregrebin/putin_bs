President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev,
I am in the happy situation today of not having to describe the state of our relations. You are one of the initiators of the integration that has been taking place in the post-Soviet area and one of the people behind the creation of the Eurasian Economic Community and the Customs Union
. The idea of the Eurasian Union, which I hope we will see realised in the future, also belongs to you. 
I remember very clearly the time we met here in Moscow with your Prime Minister and some other colleagues a few years ago, and he brought with him your message on the need to establish the Customs Union. We started moving in precisely that direction in our integration efforts. I am very pleased that our common plans and ideas have been brought into fruition as real acts and that we now have an excellent springboard from which to keep moving further.
I am very pleased to see you and welcome you to Moscow. I am sure that we will continue to act and to move in this direction.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Thank you.
We are meeting today a week since your inauguration took place. Once more, I congratulate you and wish you success.
We are strategic allies, close neighbours and partners. I think that the relations between Russia and Kazakhstan set an example throughout the post-Soviet area of how close relations can develop.
The Customs Union has already produced results and we now have a trade turnover of $25 billion. Russia is one of our biggest trade partners. Our regional cooperation is developing too. In September, we will meet in Pavlodar, as agreed, given that our regions that share common borders account for 70 percent of our trade. 
We have CIS
and CSTO
events taking place today. The CIS gave birth to the Eurasian Economic Community
, which in turn produced the Customs Union. We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to the CIS, which, for all the different aspects and circumstances within it, poses no obstacle to anyone in any way.
Thank you for today’s meeting. I think that we will have the chance to discuss business matters at our later meetings. In any case, there are no big unresolved issues between us.
We have been following your first decisions and orders. Russia is turning its attention to Siberia. This is very good and this kind of development and effort is something that was long needed.
I recall the Soviet years, when, as head of Kazakhstan’s government I was a member of the Soviet government. Before construction of the BAM railway began we heard from Chairman of Gosplan [Soviet state planning agency] Nikolai Baibakov on how much natural wealth lies along this route and how many new cities would be built. All of the different Soviet republics took part in this construction effort, some building a section of the line, some building a station. We built the Chara station. But then the work fizzled out and came to a standstill. If this could all be revived again and put to Russia’s use it would indeed be a great endeavour. I wish you the greatest success.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
Aside from our joint integration projects, we also have good plans for our bilateral ties. We have, for example, the Joint Action Plan, which is essentially the roadmap for our relations’ development.
Nursultan Nazarbayev: Most important is that on May 25, we will mark the 20th anniversary of our fundamental agreement, the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. Some of its provisions are now outdated, left behind now that we have created the Customs Union. I hope we will address this matter, make the necessary amendments and extend the agreement. I therefore invite you to come and visit me in Kazakhstan.
Vladimir Putin: It is an offer I accept with pleasure.

Meeting of heads of CSTO member states
May 15, 2012
14:45
The Kremlin, Moscow
At the meeting of heads of states parties to the Collective Security Treaty.
President OF RUSSIA VLADIMIR PUTIN: Good afternoon, friends and colleagues,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Moscow to the anniversary session of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 10th anniversary of CSTO. I sincerely congratulate you on this significant milestone.
Today we will review CSTO’s main achievements over a 10-year period. I believe that our organisation has proved itself worthy. CSTO has strengthened and matured in recent years, its international prestige has grown and it has become one of the most effective tools for maintaining collective security in its area of responsibility. It is important that we do not stop there. We must optimise a number of CSTO activities to achieve greater coordination of our actions in the international arena.
”Our organisation has proved itself worthy. CSTO has strengthened and matured in recent years, its international prestige has grown and it has become one of the most effective tools for maintaining collective security. It is important that we do not stop there.“
In accordance with the established practice, I propose that we exchange views on international issues and further steps to combat global and regional challenges and threats. I am pleased to give the floor to Mr Nazarbayev, who is chairing the CSTO meeting today.
Mr Nazarbayev has the floor.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Thank you.
Good afternoon, colleagues,
First of all, on behalf of everyone present here I would like to express our gratitude to the Russian party and to Mr Putin personally for the excellent organisation of the Collective Security Council’s anniversary meeting and for the traditional hospitality.
We congratulate you on winning the presidential election and taking office, as well as the 67th anniversary of the Great Victory, which we all celebrated.
Colleagues, I propose we continue our meeting. I hope that today, in line with the established tradition, we will exchange views on topical issues in a confidential setting and adopt a number of decisions with regard to our organisation.

I am aware that over the past several days you have been working very actively on the Government’s structure and composition. I propose that we talk about it in greater detail.
Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President, in accordance with the Federal Constitutional Law On the Government [of the Russian Federation] and in line with our agreement, I have held the necessary consultations, which resulted in a draft Executive Order of the President of the Russian Federation on the structure of federal executive bodies. It has been completed, and I as Prime Minister have signed it. I can submit it to you for consideration in line with the established procedure.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. What about the Government composition?
Dmitry Medvedev: We will not make the composition public so as not to stir up excessive interest. I have also held consultations with all the candidates to the Government and would like to submit to you the list of candidates so that you can continue consultations with them.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I will look at the draft executive order on the structure, sign it and begin consultations with all the candidates for the posts of federal ministers you propose.

Speeches at the expanded meeting of CSTO Collective Security Council
May 15, 2012
15:45
CSTO Collective Security Council meeting in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues and friends,
I am happy to greet you here in Moscow at the anniversary meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 10th anniversary of our organisation. Congratulations to all of you on this momentous occasion.
We have just held a meeting of the Collective Security Council in a restricted format, where we had a very frank exchange of views on current international issues, identified our further joint efforts to counter global and regional challenges and threats, and shared our analysis of the situation in the world and in international security.
I would like to note that our approaches to the main issues of international and regional security are very close. I am confident that CSTO’s role in the world will continue to grow.
I am pleased to give the floor to President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, who holds the presidency in the organisation this year.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
First of all, on behalf of all CSTO members I would like to express our gratitude to the Russian side and personally to President of Russia Vladimir Putin for the excellent organisation of the anniversary meeting of the Collective Security Council and the traditional hospitality. Mr Putin, I would like to once again congratulate you on your victory in the presidential election and on taking office, and to wish you success and all the best to the Russian people.
“We had a very frank exchange of views on current international issues, identified our further joint efforts to counter global and regional challenges. Our approaches to the main issues of international and regional security are very close.”
Esteemed members of the Collective Security Council, participants in the meeting,
I propose that we continue our meeting in an expanded format. At the restricted attendance meeting of the Collective Security Council we exchanged views on current global and regional security issues. As always, according to tradition, our discussion was very frank and trust-based. I believe it will be useful for our organisation and for the relations between our countries.
We also talked about boosting our collective measures in the field of security, including combating modern threats and challenges, primarily those emanating from Afghanistan. In addition, we reviewed the situation in the Middle East, Western Asia and North Africa, including the developments in Syria and the Iranian nuclear issue.
Following the restricted format meeting we adopted the Declaration of CSTO member states, which covers a wide range of international security issues that are in one way or another connected with the security of CSTO member states. The Declaration also provides a realistic assessment of the organisation’s activities since its inception.
Friends,
Today we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 10th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. In this regard, the central theme of the expanded format meeting should be CSTO’s main achievements in the period from 2002 to 2012, and priority areas of the organisation’s development.

Meeting with President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
Vladimir Putin and Emomali Rahmon discussed prospects for developing bilateral relations.
May 15, 2012
18:50
The Kremlin, Moscow
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the informal Commonwealth of Independent States summit.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon, colleagues,
I am very happy for the opportunity to meet with you – within the framework of our integration organisations and the event we are holding to address these matters – and talk about our bilateral issues.
You know, something I have noticed recently which makes me happy is that in addition to developing our relations in many different areas (not only the economy, but military cooperation as well: we have a full-fledged base functioning in Tajikistan, and I am very grateful to you for your support of its work), our relations are also developing nicely on a regional level. More than 70 of Russia’s federal constituent entities maintain relations with their partners and colleagues in Tajikistan. And when relations reach that level, it speaks to the fact that the mutual interest is becoming substantial and fundamental. We have a good foundation for diversifying all our relations, and I am certain that is exactly what will happen.
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Mr Putin, I am genuinely happy for the opportunity to meet with you.
I will take this opportunity to once again congratulate you on taking office as President of the Russian Federation.
“More than 70 of Russia’s federal constituent entities maintain relations with their partners and colleagues in Tajikistan. It speaks to the fact that the mutual interest is becoming substantial and fundamental.”
I agree with your statements and would like to add that in the last four years, despite the economic and financial crises, turnover between our nations has been increasing by an average of 10–15 per cent.
Our relations are also developing very well in the humanitarian sector: just a few days ago, we opened the second branch of one of Moscow’s higher education institutions, and a third branch will be opened this year.
Cooperation with Russia’s regions is indeed developing dynamically. Your representatives frequently visit us and our regions’ representatives visit your nation. But it is true that many untapped opportunities still remain.
We recently met – Russia’s Foreign Minister visited us – and discussed cooperation in greater detail. I want to say again that there are basically no complicated, unresolved issues between our nations.
You rightly noted that there is a military base, which exists and is operating. So far, we don’t have any problems; “Okno” [the opto-electric space surveillance station] is working well, as are other facilities on the territory of Tajikistan.
We are working quite well in the quadrilateral format within the regional integration process in the South Asian region – I am referring to Russia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. This year, we are scheduled to meet in Islamabad in September.
Overall, there are some issues that we must resolve after careful consideration, under mutually acceptable conditions, while taking into account the interests of each side. We need to negotiate and reach agreements, and we need to do that very seriously. I stated in my address and want to reiterate that in Tajikistan, we have always treated the interests of our strategic partner, the Russian Federation, with understanding and great respect. I feel that Russia must also respect the interests of its ally.
Vladimir Putin: We certainly will.

Meeting with President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych
Vladimir Putin and Viktor Yanukovych discussed prospects for developing integration processes within the CIS.
May 15, 2012

The Kremlin, Moscow
1 of 2
With President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the informal Commonwealth of Independent States summit.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Yanukovych, colleagues,
I am very happy for the opportunity to speak with you – within the framework of this informal meeting of CIS heads of state – about our bilateral relations, relations that have never been interrupted. These relations were never disrupted on a personal level, and certainly not on an interstate level.
At the same time, I want to note that recently, we have done a lot to develop bilateral ties. It is enough to say that in the last year, the growth rates for turnover between Russia and Ukraine have been much higher than the growth rate for economic ties between Russia and other nations. The turnover grew by more than 40 per cent and we achieved good results in absolute terms: trade turnover amounted to over $50 billion. Two years ago, Ukraine ranked fifth in terms of turnover with Russia, but last year’s data puts it in fourth place. Only China, Germany and the Netherlands have higher figures. This is a very good indicator. I hope that we will do everything so that these positive trends are maintained in the future.
“We have done a great deal of work on the integration track and agreed on a free trade zone. I think we now need to move toward ratification.”
President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych
: I absolutely agree with you. We have discussed this topic many times in 2010 and 2011. We understand quite well how all of this worked and where this result comes from.
Now, I would like to say a few words (we came with our small team) – first of all, to wish you success, not just in our bilateral relations, but also express our hope that you will once again strengthen Russia, literally and figuratively, and that you achieve everything. We congratulate you on taking office, the event that took place several days ago.
And naturally, we have great hope that our further work and our joint efforts in Eastern Europe and in Asia will be of interest to Ukraine and, since you are the hosting party today, that you will offer your vision of how we can become stronger together. This is very important.
We are very optimistic, and we want to support your positive disposition as well. We can see that recently, you have not hesitated to hit the ground running. This is good. We also feel that our peoples deserve to receive the amount of attention they need; we strive to improve the lives of the people of Ukraine and Russia, who are very close to one another in their mind-sets and culture. This is probably a realistic and achievable goal. We are with you.
Vladimir Putin: We have done a great deal of work on the integration track and agreed on a free trade zone. I think we now need to move toward ratification. I know we feel the same on this issue. I hope this will be true for all participating nations.
As for other areas, in order to become stronger (you know my position), we need to achieve a greater degree of integration, and this, of course, is the sovereign decision of each of our partners. I hope that today, we will also be able to discuss this in more detail.

Informal meeting of the CIS Council of Heads of State
An informal meeting of the CIS Council of Heads of State was held at the Kremlin.

Informal meeting of the CIS Council of Heads of State.
Given the informal nature of the meeting, which did not have a set agenda, the heads of CIS

Participants in the meeting included President of Russia Vladimir Putin, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
, President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan
, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
, President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
, President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
, President of Moldova Nicolae Timofti, President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
I am happy to welcome you all to this informal meeting of the CIS Council of Heads of State. I appreciate that you have all responded constructively to our invitation to come to Moscow, and that you were able to find the time to do so.
In opening our meeting, I would like to once again stress that the nations of the Commonwealth are literally our closest strategic partners. All aspects of our interactions with you are vitally important for our nation: these include issues of socio-economic development, strengthening humanitarian ties, contacts between our citizens and, of course, cooperation on the international arena.
The CIS summit and the CSTO
meeting are the first major international events to take place after Russia’s presidential election. It is true that many things unite us – first and foremost, solid traditions of friendship and good neighbourly relations between our peoples. We have a common past that spans many centuries; in more recent history, all of us were united by the Great Patriotic War and our Victory in that war, the anniversary of which we celebrated just recently.
Fortunately, we have maintained close economic, interregional, cultural and humanitarian ties. As a matter of fact, we cannot function and develop effectively in isolation from one another. Now, we face similar challenges in modernising our economies, countering new problems and threats, and working to form a more equitable and just world order.
Drawing on the solid foundation of our multidimensional cooperation, we have recently done a great deal to strengthen the CIS and other integration associations in the post-Soviet area – I am referring to our Agreement on a free trade zone, the Customs Union
, the Common Economic Space and other areas such as the CSTO, the Union State of Russia and Belarus, and others.
Among the regional associations I named, associations that differ in format, in the nature of challenges they address and the depth of integration process, the Commonwealth holds a special place as an organisation that unites the most representative composition of participants. That said, priority importance is given to further intensifying joint work with you to form an integrated economic and political union within the framework of the CIS, allowing for the efficient development of each of its participants. On the path to achieving this strategic goal, the Commonwealth will need to resolve many specific practical issues pertaining, in part, to the creation of a common economic and humanitarian space, improving the system of regional security, and increasing the international prestige of our association.
Today, we will discuss the most topical issues in our multidimensional cooperation in an informal setting. I am certain that we will have a sincere, friendly discussion. I am confident that it will benefit all the CIS member states and help to enhance the role of our Organisation.

Meeting with President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov
Vladimir Putin and Islam Karimov discussed Russian-Uzbekistani bilateral cooperation.
May 15, 2012

The Kremlin, Moscow
2 of 4
With President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the informal CIS summit, which is taking place in the Kremlin today.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Karimov, first of all, I would like to thank you for being here in Moscow today. We have amassed extensive experience of inter-state relations over the long years of our joint work, and I am sure we will be able to fully realise this potential, including the mutual commitment of our states to continue developing our relations, as well as the very high level of our personal relationship and contacts which have evolved over the years of our joint work. I am certain that we can and should use all this for the benefit of our bilateral relations and the development of ties between our nations.
President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov
: Thank you.
Mr Putin, I would like to use this opportunity to sincerely thank you and to offer my congratulations on your successful election campaign and your election to the high office of President of Russia.
I will not speak in platitudes. Everyone has congratulated you already (the whole world has been congratulating you but I am referring to our colleagues, presidents, heads of states, and prime ministers), and I find myself among the last. Therefore, I offered my sincere congratulations to you at the CSTO Summit today, which gave me great pleasure because I spoke from the heart when I said that your election is a historic event.
The situation in the world is changing rapidly, events are developing dynamically and, to put it plainly, all of us are at a turning point. I will repeat what I have already said on many occasions but this is the first time I will say it in your presence. Our time demands strong policies, especially in the socioeconomic sphere, as well as in politics and defence. We need strong people who have the understanding and the ability to fulfil their promises and do what is most necessary today.
I think some people do not fully understand the changes that are taking place in the world, and the fact that a country like Russia, which is one of the great global powers, a country with an enormous potential, should occupy a fitting place and be respected around the world.
”Uzbekistan and Russia are united by close, centuries-old ties of friendship and cooperation. Let us build on that base, which we inherited from history, from our ancestors, and move forward at the pace and with the quality that the time demands.“
In this sense, journalists should keep in mind how four years ago, when presidential elections were held in 2008, I asked you with complete honesty: “Mr Putin, perhaps you should run for a third term?” Others can interpret it as they wish but I was absolutely sincere. When demanding times come, it can happen that political upheavals (and any election is an upheaval) may take the country off course and things in general do not always go according to script, as they are expected or planned.
I am not going to continue with this theme, but in conclusion I would say this: I see a man in you who is a pragmatist, someone who looks realistically at what is going on, a man who has great patience. At the CSTO meeting today you have demonstrated your patience once again, your ability to control your nerves and hold a pause, so that everything returns to normal.
Therefore, I repeat, I sincerely congratulate you. The Russian people are a great nation, a people with a very high consciousness who put the interests of the country, of the entire nation first. Everything depends on the support you will receive, including from your colleagues.
Uzbekistan is not a small country in the post-Soviet space. Uzbekistan’s population today is nearly 30 million people. I am not saying that the population is growing rapidly: unlike Russia, we are doing everything we can to make sure that the population growth rate does not exceed 1.2 to 1.3.
It is our firm belief that given the present situation and our current prospects and resources, which include first of all water, territory and arable land, our main challenge is to provide everything our people need, and most importantly to make sure that the future generation lives better than we do, and is smarter and happier than we are. From this perspective, we try to use public campaigns, education and healthcare to ensure that population growth corresponds to economic growth. Our children should enjoy the same standards of living as children in the most developed countries. I have deviated somewhat, but this issue has a direct bearing on our bilateral personal relations.
When you first took office as President in 2000, I said that Putin is the kind of person you can go into a reconnaissance expedition with. And I want to repeat these words again today. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Mr Karimov, you have mentioned the events of 2008. At the time, my colleagues and I – it was first and foremost my own decision – decided to act strictly in line with the Russian Constitution, Russian law and the will of the Russian people. Indeed, we have completed this phase and now a new stage is beginning in Russia’s development, in the development of its economy, social sphere and I hope also of its relations with CIS countries, including Uzbekistan.
You spoke highly of Russia’s potential, and I am very grateful to you for that. We can also highly assess the potential of Uzbekistan, in terms of its population, natural resources and economic potential, which is most important. We have always considered and will continue to consider Uzbekistan as one of the key states in the region. That is how we intend to build a relationship with you, Mr Karimov, with your country as a whole. Uzbekistan and Russia are united by close, centuries-old ties of friendship and cooperation. Let us build on that base, which we inherited from history, from our ancestors, and move forward at the pace and with the quality that the time demands.
Islam Karimov: Thank you.
