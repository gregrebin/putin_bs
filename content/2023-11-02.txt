President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am glad to see you in Russia. Welcome to Moscow.
We are one month away from the 55th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries.
You have proven to be a reliable friend, and we know this well. You have also visited our country many times. Your country was represented at a high level during the recent Russia-Africa Summit.
Mr President, we have great potential in our relations, and plenty to keep us busy. I do hope that during the expanded meeting, together with our colleagues from the governments of the two countries, we will discuss our ties in their various aspects.
I am delighted to see you, Mr President. Welcome!
President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo
(retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much. Thank you for inviting me to visit your wonderful country and for the warm reception at the airport. This hospitality really struck a chord with me and my delegation.
Mr President, you know that we maintain good friendly relations with Russia. Soon, as you have just said, we will mark an anniversary of our relations.
Today, I would like to discuss our bilateral agenda with you, as well as international issues. Speaking of our relations, I would like to reinforce our defence cooperation.
Vladimir Putin: Very well, agreed.
