President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping President Putin,
Our cultural ties are developing rapidly. In 2018 and 2019, we will be holding the cross-years of Russia-China Interregional Cooperation. Our countries’ regions are making use of this opportunity to build up their ties, cooperation, mutual understanding and friendship. The number of educational and tourist exchanges between our countries is increasing.
In June of this year, Russia will host the FIFA World Cup, and in 2022 Beijing will host the Winter Olympics. China and Russia support each other in holding these international sports events and are increasing sports exchanges and cooperation.
China and Russia as permanent UN Security Council members are responsible world powers. President Putin and I have agreed to strengthen mutual support and assistance in international affairs and to deepen strategic interaction in this complicated and volatile international situation.
In this context, we are ready to work with the international community to firmly protect the world order and the system of international relations based on the norms and principles of the UN Charter. We will continue to advocate a multipolar world order and more democratic international relations, the political settlement of conflicts, new systems of international relations based on mutual respect, justice and mutual benefit. We will continue to create a community of nations with a common future and do all we can to build a clean and beautiful world of long-lasting peace, universal security, joint prosperity, openness and tolerance.
I know that the agenda of your visit is interesting and includes many events. I will accompany President Putin to a cultural event in Tianjin. We will continue discussions on issues of mutual interest. The day after tomorrow, we will attend an SCO summit with the leaders of the other member states to discuss the future of our organisation and the further development of the Shanghai spirit.
Friends, we will hold a special event soon. I will award President Putin with the first Order of Friendship. It is the highest state decoration in the People’s Republic of China awarded to foreign citizens. President Putin is a great friend of China. He is highly respected by our people and is making a great contribution to strengthening Russian-Chinese relations and friendship between our peoples. He truly deserves this award. I invite all of you to the award ceremony, which begins immediately after this meeting.
Thank you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, my dear friend! Ladies and gentlemen,
The Russian-Chinese talks were held in a constructive and business-like atmosphere. We discussed all issues related to the current state and future development of bilateral ties. We also had a meaningful exchange of opinions on key international issues.
We made certain arrangements, as you can see from our Joint Statement and a number of interdepartmental agreements we have signed.
I would like to point out the strategic nature of Russian-Chinese interaction, which is based on the principles of equality, neighbourly relations and trust.
We look forward to welcoming the President of China as the main guest at the Eastern Economic Forum, which will be held in Vladivostok in September.
Our interdepartmental commission, foreign policy and industry-specific ministries are working productively. Our parliaments and the general public have developed rewarding ties.
Our trade and economic cooperation is growing. Last year, our trade reached $87 billion. We have increased the delivery of added-value products, including machines, equipment, and vehicles.
In January to March 2018, Russian-Chinese trade went up by 31 percent. If we keep up the pace, we will be able to report a record figure this year towards which we have been working for the past few years – $100 billion.
We are expanding our investment cooperation. Over 70 priority projects worth more than $20 billion are being implemented within the framework of the Intergovernmental Commission on Investment Cooperation.
Energy is the key sphere of bilateral cooperation. Russia is China’s largest fuel supplier to the Chinese market. It supplied over 50 million tonnes of oil to China last year and increased deliveries by 26 percent in January to April 2018. The construction of a gas pipeline via the eastern route is proceeding to schedule.
The parties have coordinated the main parameters of Russian natural gas deliveries from the Russian Far East to China. Russian and Chinese energy companies are working together in gas production and liquefaction at Yamal LNG. Chinese consumers received the first gas from the Yamal field in December 2017.
Under a package of agreements that have been signed in Beijing, Rosatom will build two more power units for the Tianwan NPP. Russia and China have coordinated the construction of one more Russian-designed nuclear power plant in China.
Russia will assist China in the construction of a demonstration fast reactor. Cutting-edge Russian achievements will be applied in China’s Moon exploration programme.
I would like to point out the unequalled format of Russia’s cooperation with China. I am referring to the highly sensitive, unique joint projects of Russian and Chinese researchers.
We also discussed cooperation in high-tech areas, such as the creation of long-haul aircraft and a heavy-lift helicopter.
