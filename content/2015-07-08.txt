With President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon, friends, it is a great pleasure to welcome you to Ufa.
I am very happy to see that our relations with Tajikistan are developing very positively. Last year, despite the economic difficulties in Europe, the world, and here in Russia, our trade with Tajikistan increased by more than 21 percent, which is a very good sign. There was a small adjustment downwards at the start of this year, but the trend is very positive overall.
We note the good, high quality work Tajikistan is doing as the country presiding in the CSTO
. A large number of important events are taking place, including military exercises that have been a success. We are preparing for the CSTO summit in Tajikistan on September 15.
Thank you for agreeing to come to Ufa to take part in the BRICS
and SCO
summits. We are very happy to see you. Welcome!
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
I am pleased to have this chance to meet. Thank you for the invitation and for the excellent conditions for our work. I am sure that the SCO summit will be a success.
Tajikistan and Russia are strategic partners. I therefore want to talk today about developing the relations between our countries in all different areas. This is our priority.
Yes, the CSTO has organised many big events, not just military exercises. The defence ministers and the heads of other agencies held meetings during the summit. There have been meetings, and exercises, and a lot of effort has been made to strengthen the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
During our meeting today, we also want to discuss implementation of agreements signed earlier. You noted that our trade is not increasing just now, but there are some possibilities and some reserves that we need to put to use in the future.
Vladimir Putin: Our colleagues are coming to the BRICS summit too, as I said. I think you will have the chance to meet on the sidelines of the two summits with a broader circle of heads of state and government of other countries too.
Emomali Rahmon: Yes, certainly. Thank you very much.

With President of China Xi Jinping.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President of China, dear friend and comrade Xi Jinping, Chinese friends,
Let me wish you all a warm welcome to Ufa, one of the Volga region’s most beautiful cities. Thank you for agreeing to take part in first the BRICS
summit and then the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit
. This part of Russia is one of our country’s most beautiful corners and I hope you will like it here.
I know that the authorities here in Bashkortostan and the local people have put in a lot of effort to prepare well for hosting these events.
We are all very pleased to see our guests and friends here, but I will not hide that it makes us especially happy to see our Chinese friends, given the extensive humanitarian and political contacts we have and our growing trade and economic ties.
We are fully aware of the difficulties we face in the economy and in international politics, but if we join our efforts, I am sure we can overcome all problems before us and resolve all the tasks.
We are very happy to see you. Welcome!
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): Mr President, my old friend, it is a pleasure to see you again and to meet with other old friends.
I did indeed arrive in Ufa today in the best of moods. Many asked me, “Where exactly is Ufa?” and I also said that I was going there for the first time.
But when I looked out of the plane window, I saw what really is a very beautiful city. What’s more, there was so much forest down below. I am sure that this is a very clean and attractive city, and I am staying in an excellent hotel here. I thank you once again for the warm welcome and hospitality, and I thank the local authorities too for organising these summits.
I would also like to thank you again for the welcome reception I was given during my recent visit to Moscow. The parade on Red Square made a deep impression on my colleagues and me. It made a deep impression on the Chinese people in general and helped us to gain a deeper understanding of that war [the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War].
Our participation together in the events celebrating the 70th anniversary of Victory had broad resonance and sent a challenge to the entire world to celebrate this event.
I am looking forward to seeing you in September in China to take part in celebrating the 70th anniversary of victory in our war against the Japanese invaders and the victory in the war against fascism. We will continue working together with the international community to make our contribution to the cause of peace throughout the world.
It is with great pleasure that we have accepted your invitation to take part in the seventh summit of the BRICS and SCO leaders. I am ready to pursue the closest contacts with you in order to ensure that these summits are a success and produce results.
I know that your former Prime Minister, Mr Primakov, died recently and I express my profound condolences and pass on my words of sincere sympathy to his family and friends.
He was one of the founders of our strategic partnership relations and made a great contribution to developing peace. Our people will always have fond memories of him.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your condolences.
Mr Primakov was without question one of the founders of Russia’s policy today. He was a man of great influence and served his country long and well.

The two leaders discussed further development of the strategic partnership between Russia and India, and bolstering the share of innovation and high-tech cooperation in the two countries’ bilateral trade and economic ties.
Mr Putin noted too, that the process of India’s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
as a full-fledged member is now beginning.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, it is a great pleasure to welcome you to Russia.
Let me start this conversation by noting an important event: we are starting the process of India’s full-fledged accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We also want to thank you for the active support you have given our country’s presidency in the BRICS
group.
At this summit, we will adopt the BRICS countries’ long-term economic partnership strategy and launch the start of practical work on the New Development Bank and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement.
Of course, I am also pleased to have this chance to discuss our bilateral strategic relations and their development.
Welcome!
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi
(retranslated): First of all, Mr President, I want to thank you for this very warm reception you have given my delegation and I.
We began this journey to the BRICS summit in 2009, and today we are seeing the results. We have important events ahead at this BRICS summit.
The President of India visited Russia in May. I thank you for the warm reception you gave him. Later this year, another India-Russia summit will take place and I will have the chance to come to Russia.
If I have the chance to visit Astrakhan, I would like to do so, because when I was governor of my native state of Gujarat, there were, and still are, brotherly relations between Gujarat and Astrakhan. I see now that you have this good tradition of organising various summits in different venues. Perhaps we could organise our summit in Astrakhan.
On June 21, we celebrated International Yoga Day. We know that Russia was a co-sponsor of our proposal on this at the UN, but what is also pleasing to see is that this event was celebrated all around Russia, throughout the regions, on a big scale and with everyone taking part and full of enthusiasm. I thank you for this. I think that young people, with their general interest in living a healthy lifestyle, found a lot of inspiration here.
We hope that India will soon become a full-fledged member of the SCO
. This will happen during Russia’s presidency in the SCO. You called me and spoke about this, and I am grateful to you.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I have tried many things, but never yoga, but it cannot fail to attract. I will see what my level of fitness allows, but when you see real yogis, it seems that it would be impossible to reach that kind of skill, and that’s what stops me.
But we really do cherish and take genuine deep interest in Indian culture, and so all of our ties, including in humanitarian areas, are extremely important to us and we will continue to develop all of these areas.

Meeting with President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff
Vladimir Putin had a meeting with President of the Federative Republic of Brazil Dilma Rousseff. The two heads of state discussed key issues in bilateral cooperation, including the opportunity to expand trade and economic as well as cultural and humanitarian ties.

With President of the Federative Republic of Brazil Dilma Rousseff.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madame President, friends, good evening. We are very happy to see you.
We hope and are even confident that the BRICS
summit will be successful. And we are very happy to meet with you on the sidelines of this event, to discuss our bilateral relations and promising projects.
First of all, I would like to note that our relations are developing quite positively and we are seeing regular contacts in nearly all areas, including in the parliamentary dimension.
Last year, our trade grew by 15% and in the first quarter of this year, we have seen a slight decline, but I am confident that our trade growth will continue.
We certainly need to do more in terms of investment cooperation; we need to work toward the possible use of national currencies in our trade and economic ties and continue work in the high-tech sectors, such as aviation and space exploration.
We are grateful to you that two Brazilian stations are already using the GLONASS
system and now, we will agree on creating a complex for tracking space debris – an extremely important issue not only for Russia and Brazil, but for nearly all participants in international communications and those working in space.
Welcome, Madame President!
President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff
(retranslated): Mr President, it is a great honour for me to be here in Ufa. Unfortunately, I was unable to come for the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
I want to express my admiration of the level of preparation for this BRICS heads of state summit and I am confident that this meeting will be successful. I also feel that this seventh top-level meeting of the BRICS nations is a kind of watershed, because we are talking about the creation of a New Development Bank, as well as a Contingent Reserve Arrangement. I feel that we must do everything possible to increase turnover; its current level is insufficient compared to its potential. It is imperative for us to achieve the goal of $10 billion in turnover.
We must do everything possible to increase mutual investment and we are currently seeing a wonderful moment for this, because Brazil is implementing an infrastructure investment plan and we know that Russia has a fairly large number of companies that work on building ports and railroads.
In 2004, while you were serving as President of the Russian Federation, we established a strategic partnership and we are carrying out all our actions taking into account the priorities that were identified then. For us, one of the greatest priorities in our bilateral relations was trade cooperation, as well as mutual partnership in launching satellites.

Meeting with President of South Africa Jacob Zuma.
Mr Putin and Mr Zuma put particular emphasis on diversifying trade and economic cooperation, developing investment ties, and expanding humanitarian contacts.
The two presidents also exchanged views on a number of international issues and looked at cooperation within multilateral organisations and regional integration groups.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, let me wish you a warm welcome to Ufa and to Russia.
I would like to start by saying once again that South Africa is Russia’s major partner in Africa, a reliable and strategic partner. We have constructive cooperation in all areas, in our bilateral relations, and in our work in international organisations such as the UN, BRICS
, WTO, and the IAEA
.
Mr Zuma, I want to thank you for supporting the development of Russia’s contacts with organisations such as the African Union and the Southern African Development Community, in which South Africa unquestionably plays a key role.
I am very pleased to have the chance to meet with you on the sidelines of the BRICS summit to discuss our bilateral relations.
President of South Africa Jacob Zuma
: Thank you very much, Your Excellency, Mr President. Thank you for welcoming us so warm in a very beautiful city of Ufa. We are very happy to be here. I would like to congratulate you for hosting the BRICS meeting here. We are very happy to attend the BRICS in the Russian Federation.
We also agree, we think it is an appropriate theme of this BRICS, BRICS Partnership: A Powerful Factor in the Global Development. I think it is absolutely appropriate.
And I would like to echo the words that South Africa is indeed a true friend of the Russian Federation and it remains so, and we are happy to have that kind of relationship with your country.
We are happy to have this meeting on the sidelines of BRICS so that we could discuss our bilateral issues, I agree with you. We are very happy to have this opportunity. We are also happy with the process of preparing the BRICS because there was very good quality of working together with that delegation, and we agreed on all the important aspects that have formed the agenda of the meeting.
So, we are very happy and I think BRICS will go well.

Meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko

The two presidents discussed, in particular, bilateral cooperation in trade, the economy and investment, expanding cultural and humanitarian ties, and cooperation within Russia-Belarus Union State, the Customs Union, and the Eurasian Economic Union.

Meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, friends, good evening. Please allow me to welcome you to Ufa.
Belarus is certainly our closest strategic partner and ally. We cooperate in all areas, from military sphere to humanitarian, and resolve social issues in the interest of our citizens, developing cooperative ties within the framework of the Union State, as well as the Customs Union
, and now the Eurasian Economic Union
. We have many major, serious plans.
In light of your visit to Ufa, I would like to congratulate you on achieving the goal you have set for Belarus and which you asked us to support: enhancing Belarus status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
.
This matter can be considered resolved. Belarus gets observer status in this prestigious international organisation, whose role in the modern world is growing. We are confident that your participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s work will be beneficial for Belarus and all the participants in this process.
President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko: Mr Putin, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to visit another wonderful corner of Russia. This is my first time here, but I feel in my gut, as we say in Belarus, that this is a very comfortable, beautiful city, and I understand that it has changed for this summit.
I feel very good here because this is almost a copy of our Belarus, especially north of Minsk: during our landing, we noticed that the natural landscape is very similar. We are experiencing a serious heat wave, so we have come here to rest.
I would like to discuss three sets of issues with you. First, I thank you again for the opportunity to meet with presidents that I have long wanted to meet, and we have been working on these meetings for a long time. I don’t even have to go anywhere, since I am meeting with four presidents on the same platform. And perhaps there will be more meetings.
Second, I want to discuss the problems of the Eurasian Economic Union, particularly with regard to Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO. Earlier, we determined that we would have consultations on this matter, so I would like to discuss it.
And third, you just stated that Belarus is the closest ally of the Russian President and the Russian Federation. We have issues in our bilateral relations; we are going through a period that is difficult but can certainly be overcome; here, I completely agree with you.
We have been dealing with this for a long time, and now you are going through it too, though perhaps to a lesser degree, so we need to discuss, based on the resolutions of our Union’s Council of Ministers, how to make further steps to overcome the negative trends that may occur soon.
These are the three areas I want to discuss. I won’t hold you long, I know and see on television that you have much to do as the host these days – meeting and talking with everyone. Still, we fully support Russia’s agreements with the world’s leading powers through these organisations, especially since we finally have organisations that risked contradicting, or rather taking somewhat different actions on the global arena.
This can only benefit all the people of the world. And the financial and economic steps you have taken recently within the framework of the SCO and BRICS are a very good direction, and I thank you for your support.
Now, Mr Sergei Lavrov
will not reproach us for being oriented one way only – toward the West. I’m joking, of course. We will defend our interests and represent the common interests of these organisations. Thank you.
