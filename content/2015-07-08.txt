With President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon, friends, it is a great pleasure to welcome you to Ufa.
I am very happy to see that our relations with Tajikistan are developing very positively. Last year, despite the economic difficulties in Europe, the world, and here in Russia, our trade with Tajikistan increased by more than 21 percent, which is a very good sign. There was a small adjustment downwards at the start of this year, but the trend is very positive overall.
We note the good, high quality work Tajikistan is doing as the country presiding in the CSTO
. A large number of important events are taking place, including military exercises that have been a success. We are preparing for the CSTO summit in Tajikistan on September 15.
Thank you for agreeing to come to Ufa to take part in the BRICS
and SCO
summits. We are very happy to see you. Welcome!
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Thank you very much, Mr President.
I am pleased to have this chance to meet. Thank you for the invitation and for the excellent conditions for our work. I am sure that the SCO summit will be a success.
Tajikistan and Russia are strategic partners. I therefore want to talk today about developing the relations between our countries in all different areas. This is our priority.
Yes, the CSTO has organised many big events, not just military exercises. The defence ministers and the heads of other agencies held meetings during the summit. There have been meetings, and exercises, and a lot of effort has been made to strengthen the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
During our meeting today, we also want to discuss implementation of agreements signed earlier. You noted that our trade is not increasing just now, but there are some possibilities and some reserves that we need to put to use in the future.
Vladimir Putin: Our colleagues are coming to the BRICS summit too, as I said. I think you will have the chance to meet on the sidelines of the two summits with a broader circle of heads of state and government of other countries too.
Emomali Rahmon: Yes, certainly. Thank you very much.

With President of China Xi Jinping.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President of China, dear friend and comrade Xi Jinping, Chinese friends,
Let me wish you all a warm welcome to Ufa, one of the Volga region’s most beautiful cities. Thank you for agreeing to take part in first the BRICS
summit and then the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit
. This part of Russia is one of our country’s most beautiful corners and I hope you will like it here.
I know that the authorities here in Bashkortostan and the local people have put in a lot of effort to prepare well for hosting these events.
We are all very pleased to see our guests and friends here, but I will not hide that it makes us especially happy to see our Chinese friends, given the extensive humanitarian and political contacts we have and our growing trade and economic ties.
We are fully aware of the difficulties we face in the economy and in international politics, but if we join our efforts, I am sure we can overcome all problems before us and resolve all the tasks.
We are very happy to see you. Welcome!
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): Mr President, my old friend, it is a pleasure to see you again and to meet with other old friends.
I did indeed arrive in Ufa today in the best of moods. Many asked me, “Where exactly is Ufa?” and I also said that I was going there for the first time.
But when I looked out of the plane window, I saw what really is a very beautiful city. What’s more, there was so much forest down below. I am sure that this is a very clean and attractive city, and I am staying in an excellent hotel here. I thank you once again for the warm welcome and hospitality, and I thank the local authorities too for organising these summits.
I would also like to thank you again for the welcome reception I was given during my recent visit to Moscow. The parade on Red Square made a deep impression on my colleagues and me. It made a deep impression on the Chinese people in general and helped us to gain a deeper understanding of that war [the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War].
Our participation together in the events celebrating the 70th anniversary of Victory had broad resonance and sent a challenge to the entire world to celebrate this event.
I am looking forward to seeing you in September in China to take part in celebrating the 70th anniversary of victory in our war against the Japanese invaders and the victory in the war against fascism. We will continue working together with the international community to make our contribution to the cause of peace throughout the world.
It is with great pleasure that we have accepted your invitation to take part in the seventh summit of the BRICS and SCO leaders. I am ready to pursue the closest contacts with you in order to ensure that these summits are a success and produce results.
I know that your former Prime Minister, Mr Primakov, died recently and I express my profound condolences and pass on my words of sincere sympathy to his family and friends.
He was one of the founders of our strategic partnership relations and made a great contribution to developing peace. Our people will always have fond memories of him.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your condolences.
Mr Primakov was without question one of the founders of Russia’s policy today. He was a man of great influence and served his country long and well.

The two leaders discussed further development of the strategic partnership between Russia and India, and bolstering the share of innovation and high-tech cooperation in the two countries’ bilateral trade and economic ties.
Mr Putin noted too, that the process of India’s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
as a full-fledged member is now beginning.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, it is a great pleasure to welcome you to Russia.
Let me start this conversation by noting an important event: we are starting the process of India’s full-fledged accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We also want to thank you for the active support you have given our country’s presidency in the BRICS
group.
At this summit, we will adopt the BRICS countries’ long-term economic partnership strategy and launch the start of practical work on the New Development Bank and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement.
Of course, I am also pleased to have this chance to discuss our bilateral strategic relations and their development.
Welcome!
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi
(retranslated): First of all, Mr President, I want to thank you for this very warm reception you have given my delegation and I.
We began this journey to the BRICS summit in 2009, and today we are seeing the results. We have important events ahead at this BRICS summit.
The President of India visited Russia in May. I thank you for the warm reception you gave him. Later this year, another India-Russia summit will take place and I will have the chance to come to Russia.
If I have the chance to visit Astrakhan, I would like to do so, because when I was governor of my native state of Gujarat, there were, and still are, brotherly relations between Gujarat and Astrakhan. I see now that you have this good tradition of organising various summits in different venues. Perhaps we could organise our summit in Astrakhan.
On June 21, we celebrated International Yoga Day. We know that Russia was a co-sponsor of our proposal on this at the UN, but what is also pleasing to see is that this event was celebrated all around Russia, throughout the regions, on a big scale and with everyone taking part and full of enthusiasm. I thank you for this. I think that young people, with their general interest in living a healthy lifestyle, found a lot of inspiration here.
We hope that India will soon become a full-fledged member of the SCO
. This will happen during Russia’s presidency in the SCO. You called me and spoke about this, and I am grateful to you.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I have tried many things, but never yoga, but it cannot fail to attract. I will see what my level of fitness allows, but when you see real yogis, it seems that it would be impossible to reach that kind of skill, and that’s what stops me.
But we really do cherish and take genuine deep interest in Indian culture, and so all of our ties, including in humanitarian areas, are extremely important to us and we will continue to develop all of these areas.

With President of the Federative Republic of Brazil Dilma Rousseff.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madame President, friends, good evening. We are very happy to see you.
We hope and are even confident that the BRICS
summit will be successful. And we are very happy to meet with you on the sidelines of this event, to discuss our bilateral relations and promising projects.
First of all, I would like to note that our relations are developing quite positively and we are seeing regular contacts in nearly all areas, including in the parliamentary dimension.
Last year, our trade grew by 15% and in the first quarter of this year, we have seen a slight decline, but I am confident that our trade growth will continue.
We certainly need to do more in terms of investment cooperation; we need to work toward the possible use of national currencies in our trade and economic ties and continue work in the high-tech sectors, such as aviation and space exploration.
We are grateful to you that two Brazilian stations are already using the GLONASS
system and now, we will agree on creating a complex for tracking space debris – an extremely important issue not only for Russia and Brazil, but for nearly all participants in international communications and those working in space.
Welcome, Madame President!
President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff
(retranslated): Mr President, it is a great honour for me to be here in Ufa. Unfortunately, I was unable to come for the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
I want to express my admiration of the level of preparation for this BRICS heads of state summit and I am confident that this meeting will be successful. I also feel that this seventh top-level meeting of the BRICS nations is a kind of watershed, because we are talking about the creation of a New Development Bank, as well as a Contingent Reserve Arrangement. I feel that we must do everything possible to increase turnover; its current level is insufficient compared to its potential. It is imperative for us to achieve the goal of $10 billion in turnover.
We must do everything possible to increase mutual investment and we are currently seeing a wonderful moment for this, because Brazil is implementing an infrastructure investment plan and we know that Russia has a fairly large number of companies that work on building ports and railroads.
In 2004, while you were serving as President of the Russian Federation, we established a strategic partnership and we are carrying out all our actions taking into account the priorities that were identified then. For us, one of the greatest priorities in our bilateral relations was trade cooperation, as well as mutual partnership in launching satellites.
