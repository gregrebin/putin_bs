Vladimir Putin addresses Russian school leavers.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear school leavers,
Today is a festive and at the same time a sad day for you: you have graduated from school and are about to embark on your adult lives.
I am sure that despite all the difficulties and problems that you came across over the years in school, despite everything, you will look back on these years with warmth and love.
You will remember your teachers and you will stay friends. The school gave you loyal and reliable friends who will stay with you during your whole lives.
The door into the future is about to open before you. You should always think about the future, but on days like this, at moments like this, it is impossible not to think about it.
Whatever your destiny, many, if not all the most important things in your life will depend only on you.
Congratulations and I wish you the best of luck.
