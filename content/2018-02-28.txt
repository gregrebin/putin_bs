President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal Chancellor, friends,
First, let me thank you for accepting our invitation.
To commence our conversation I would like to emphasise the special relations we have been building for many years. They influence the most important area, the economy.
Last year we saw a growth in mutual trade of over 40 percent. Russian investments to Austria’s economy reached $23 billion, while Austrian investments into Russia’s economy accounted for $5 billion. We have an intergovernmental commission and other instruments that are working well.
Mr Chancellor, we are delighted to see you. We have a wide range of matters of mutual interest to discuss.
 Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz (retranslated):Mr President Putin,
I heartily thank you for the opportunity to meet with you here in Moscow. As Foreign Minister, I have had the honour in recent years to enjoy good cooperation with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
. Ii is a pleasure to be here in Moscow as Federal Chancellor.
We have a long-standing tradition of good bilateral relations. As you have said, since last year we have witnessed a positive development of economic ties, including tourism. I will be happy to discuss with you bilateral relations, their improvement, relations between the European Union and Russia, and international issues.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
