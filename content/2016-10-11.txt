President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
The current meeting of the Council on Sport is devoted to physical education, developing an effective system for involving our people in sports and creating new opportunities for self-realisation in sports.
 The demand for a healthy lifestyle and sports is one of the positive trends in the development of modern Russian society. In the past three years, the number of those who regularly visit gyms increased by almost 35 percent to reach 43.5 million people – almost one-third of the country’s population.
Let me recall that we planned to involve up to 40 percent of the population in systematic fitness and sports activities by 2020. I am confident that if we preserve the current dynamics we are sure to reach this goal.
However, the issue is not limited to statistics. The main point is health, useful leisure and a positive attitude to life that is formed by sports. Naturally, it is necessary to develop physical culture and a responsible attitude to oneself from an early age.
Much has already been done to get as many children and young people as possible involved in regular physical activity. This work should be continued. It is necessary to attentively monitor the efficiency of adopted decisions, such as, for instance, the development of the system of competitions and the student sports movement.
At the same time, involving the economically active population in sports remains an urgent issue. The existing organisational structure is inadequate. In this context, the proposal of the Council’s working group to restore physical fitness and sports societies is justified and promising. It is necessary to determine the goals and tasks of their activities, and define their authority and the mechanism of cooperation, in particular, with departments, large corporations and public associations.
Needless to say, both the Ministry of Sport and the Russian Olympic Committee should carefully look into all this, while sports federations should draw the appropriate conclusions.
Concentrating resources in a rational way and forming a clear-cut system for training our budding athletes should be among the priorities of the new Olympic cycle. I suggest discussing these issues at the next meeting of our Council.
Naturally, we need to focus on science in sport, which we are not developing fast enough, and on combating doping, of course.
We certainly see considerable politicisation of this sphere and sometimes, as I have already said, a biased attitude to our athletes. However, we must acknowledge that in a way we ourselves gave cause for this. We made quite a few mistakes and miscalculations in this most important and highly sensitive area.
There are many problems here. Some are ours, others are common for world sport and should be resolved in close cooperation with our partners.
Both Russia and other countries are interested in the existing international anti-doping system becoming transparent and open, and, most importantly, ensuring the absolute equality of all members of the large Olympic family and the immutability of the provisions of the Olympic Charter. No doubt, Russia will do all it can to reach these goals.
We have already drafted some proposals and established the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission headed by IOC Honourary Member Vitaly Smirnov who is present here today.
Overall, to ensure the absolute independence of national anti-doping agencies we intend to considerably adjust the organisational activities of the Russian anti-doping structure RUSADA.
As you already know, the Ministry of Sport is no longer its founding member. Now Russia’s Olympic and Paralympic committees will become its founders. It will be funded directly from the federal budget. Incidentally, the activities of the World Anti-Doping Agency — WADA—will be financed in the same way.
Changes will also affect the Russian Anti-Doping Laboratory. Moscow Lomonosov State University will coordinate its work.
Of course, new formats will make their way to the sports management system as well. I think that none of those present here will object if I say that national Olympic and Paralympic committees and Russian sports federations, rather than the executive authorities, should interact with the international sports federations and the International Olympic and Paralympic committees.
I discussed this with Alexander Zhukov [President of the Russian Olympic Committee]. We are aware that he was elected First Deputy Speaker of the State Duma, and we discussed it with him. He wants to concentrate on his work in the Duma (it is a big job, and he has a high position). The Olympic cycle has ended, and the new one is just beginning. This is certainly correct, and we will support it in every way. Mr Zhukov has done a lot for sports, and I hope he will do even more.
However, this issue should be tackled in contact with the International Olympic Committee, so that we do not lose Russia’s standing in the IOC. It is imperative to consult Mr Bach on these issues before we do anything or decide on anything.
Besides, I would like to tell you that Prime Minister Medvedev and I have discussed a number of issues that are close to sports, such as youth policy and tourism. Sports, youth, and tourism are all very close. We believe they should be brought together under one roof and be supervised by one deputy prime minister. The Government will come up with specific proposals in the near future, including the name of such a supervisory authority.
Importantly, these are the first steps on the path of reform in the sports sector.
I would like to reiterate that Russia has always been a proponent of fair, just and equitable sports competition. At the Games in Rio, our team showed what ”clean“ Russian athletes are capable of.
A large number of our athletes were able to prove themselves in spite of everything. Our country now has new heroes and new positive role models. Let us think of ways to make sure that these role models enjoy even more recognition and fame.

Vladimir Putin spoke at a plenary session of the sixth Russia – Country of Sports international forum.
The forum is being held in the town of Kovrov, Vladimir Region, on 10–13 October, and is dedicated to promoting physical fitness and sport in Russia through 2030, and developing mechanisms to counter global threats, including doping and fixing the outcome of competitions. The programme also includes a number of sporting events, workshops, and exhibitions.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.
I am pleased to welcome you to our traditional international sports forum.
This year, it is held in Vladimir Region. Kovrov is a small town, but this is an ancient land, a centre of Russian statehood. For us, this land is of a particular historical, cultural and civilisational value.
I am sure that many of you have already explored the landmarks of Vladimir Region, witnessed the magnificence of Russian architecture, the unmatched crafts practiced here, and had a chance to experience the sincere and warm hospitality that is characteristic of the Russian people, and their open and generous hearts. I am referring to our foreign guests. Let us welcome them once again, and thank them for coming here.
I hope you also had a chance to see that the centuries-old history of Vladimir Region goes hand in hand with its dynamic present-day growth. Indeed, this is a region with major industrial, cultural, educational, and tourist potential.
This potential is being successfully developed, and the example of Vladimir Region shows us how much positive change has occurred in this country in recent years, including the sphere of physical fitness and sport. Promoting them has become a top priority of our social policy. These efforts of the state, society, and numerous sport enthusiasts have already produced visible results. Sport has reclaimed its appeal, most importantly, among children and young people.
The combination of brilliant victories at the world's biggest competitions, the development of the sports infrastructure, an ever growing appreciation of the importance of a healthy lifestyle are positive results. Opting to do sports is an evident trend in our country; sports have become trendy. The Government will continue working to create conditions for physical fitness and sports.
We will certainly welcome those who take on the responsibility to establish local teams, develop school and university sports, and organise various competitions; we certainly support athletic and sports organisations and the revived Ready for Labour and Defence movement.
The sports industry is primarily socially oriented. However, we understand that at the same time, it should be a factor of economic growth and economic development, should contribute to the development of modern sports infrastructure and industry, and should stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises to manufacture sporting goods and equipment.
All the targets listed in the sector’s Development Strategy until 2020 should certainly be met. Moreover, we must start working towards the targets of the next long-term period of sports development in Russia.
Friends, as I have said, forum participants include heads of international sports organisations, those who are professionally engaged in sports and sports event organisation, who see sport as the focus of their lives, who devote their talent and skills to promoting the humanistic values of sport.
Sports are rightly called a universal language of communication, and I am confident that our cooperation will unfold in the spirit of mutual trust and strong partnership. We will work together to keep sport fair and transparent, completely open and non-political, so that its ideas and values unite countries and peoples.
When we discuss the purity of sport, we mean not only politics, which, unfortunately, interferes with sport, but also taking on doping. Of course, sport should be free of doping. We will fight for the purity of sport. But we must know for sure what is being done and how in this critical area. We all need to know who is being checked and when, how such tests are conducted, what the results are and what comes next in the process.
We must, of course, eliminate any and all abuse in this sphere. We all saw how many so-called authorisations for medical reasons were issued to particular athletes. Perhaps all is as it should be, and I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but we need to understand how we are going to approach this. Otherwise, we may face a situation where all the records and victories come from athletes who suffer from particular chronic diseases.
Clearly, these athletes must be protected. But we all need to understand what we are going to do about it. Perhaps we should create a special category for them and put in place a separate system to account for their merits, points, seconds, and achievements. I am not sure yet, I have no answer to that question, but, clearly, we must think about it.
The Olympic Charter clearly states that the purpose of the Olympic movement is to serve the harmonious development of humankind, and promote a peaceful society. These objectives are paramount for international sport and the international sport movement. That is what we should be working towards, that is where we need to focus.
I wish all the forum participants productive and constructive work.
Thank you.

Meeting with representatives of international sports organisations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends and colleagues, I am very glad to greet all of you once again.
Many of you – virtually all of you – have been in this country more than once and took part in organising different events. You know how sports life is organised here. I was eager to let you see how it is developing in the regions at the grassroots level.
We are in one of the regions. It is not a metropolis, not a city with a multi-million population. It is one of Russia’s small cities. We are trying to build sports facilities in such places as well.
Regrettably, this is certainly not enough. Speaking today at the meeting with my colleagues, with the Presidential Council on Sport, I said that 43 million people go in for sports here. However, this is less than some other countries, our neighbours have. We still have to do much in this respect, but the pace is good and we will continue moving in this direction.
You know that we also hold major sports events, world and European championships. We hosted the Olympic Games in Sochi recently, in 2014.
Mr Zhukov, Chairman of our National Olympic Committee, is actively working on the IOC’s instructions in China, helping our Chinese friends on the IOC’s behalf to prepare for the 2022 Olympic Games.
We are hoping that our contacts with you, heads of international sports organisations, will continue at the top level for the sake of developing sports in our countries and the world as a whole, for the sake of consolidating the Olympic movement and, most importantly, in the interests of millions of people.
