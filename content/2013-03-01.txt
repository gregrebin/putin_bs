At an event paying tribute to the memory of paratroopers killed in action.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, families of the hero-paratroopers,
This evening’s event pays tribute to the immortal deeds and eternal memory of the heroes from the 6th Paratroopers Company. They will remain forever in Russian military history and in our hearts.
They fought their battles at a decisive moment in the fate of Russia and its people. International terrorism unleashed a cruel, ruthless and criminal war against us with the single aim of tearing our country apart, violating its sovereignty, and plunging Russia and its people into a bloody civil war.
Of course we could not let this happen, and thus it was that the heroes from the 6th Company did not retreat a single step and stayed loyal to their oath of service and the brotherhood of soldiers.
They grew up in a time of peace, came from all corners of Russia to this regiment, and were proud to be serving in the paratroopers forces. They probably never specially prepared to become heroes, but as befits a soldier, they were ready without question to carry out their mission, no matter what the difficulties, risks and dangers involved.
When the hour came they acted as true heroes and fought the enemy every bit as fearlessly as their grandfathers before them fought the Nazis. They proved at the cost of their lives that the most sacred values still live on through the generations. Who would dare say after this that our young people have no patriotic spirit?
The 6th Company’s soldiers showed the entire world that Russia is invincible because at the critical moment its courageous sons will always fight to the death for their homeland.
We bow our heads in tribute before the hero-paratroopers. We are proud of their devotion to Russia. I bow low before the parents who raised such worthy sons.
Eternal glory to the immortal 6th Company! Glory to all who have given their lives defending Russia!

Meeting with paratroopers commanders
March 1, 2013

Pskov
Meeting with commanders of paratroopers units.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: You all know why we are here today, and so I will not repeat myself again, though there is no repeating the number of times we could talk about the feats of the 6th Company’s men. But we are here now to discuss the issues facing the Armed Forces in general and the paratroopers in particular.
When I said on the parade ground before that our people feel love and pride for and trust in the paratroopers those were not chance words. This is the truth. This really is the case.
But the paratroopers are to be up to the task in every sense of the word. Of course they must be ready in practice for every test that comes their way, and ready to work effectively in conditions of modern warfare.
Let’s talk about all of the different aspects of your life and work – the everyday conditions, training, weapons, in short, about all the different issues of interest to you.
Please, go ahead.
Commander of The 76TH Guards Air Assault Division Guards Colonel Alexei Naumets: Comrade Commander-in-Chief,
First of all, I want to express my real gratitude to you for finding the time in your very busy schedule to come here on this day of tragedy and commemoration to be with us here, be together with the families and relatives who lost in this battle the most precious thing they had. We remember the men who did not leave the battlefield even at the cost of their lives.
I also want to say a huge thank you to you on behalf of all of our comrades in arms for the attention you give the servicemen and their family members, and I can assure you that the paratroopers in my division will carry out any mission that you and the Government give them.
Vladimir Putin: Good, I have no doubt of this. Now let’s discuss the specific issues on your minds.
