President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear veterans,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear guests,
My most heartfelt congratulations to you all on Victory Day! The Day of Russia's glory and might! The holiday that lifts our hearts shedding the light of kindness and spiritual generosity!
Victory in the Great Patriotic War represents a milestone that changed the world. It is a universal, world-scale event. And no matter how much time has passed since the triumphant day of May 9, 1945, our country will always honour the generation of the victors.
Time cannot blur either our memory or our common responsibility for the preservation of the heroic legacy of our Motherland's defenders. The glorious Victory has been and will always be the ultimate yardstick to measure our thoughts and deeds.
Our people fought for their national sacred things – for their Motherland, home, culture and mother tongue, for the moral and spiritual values. For freedom in Europe and for peace on Earth. And in this righteous and sacred fight against the Nazism they did not spare their lives. They withstood it all and won!
We will always remember that the Victory was ensured by unity and genuine brotherhood of all the peoples of the Soviet Union.
We pay tribute to the heroic deed of the soldiers of the anti-Hitler coalition and the antifascists who drew the fight nearer to victory.
The spirit of alliance forged during World War II today remains an example of partnership and cooperation of all the countries in the name of peace and just cause.

Dear friends,
Today we share the same feelings of joy and excitement, grief and pride. And of course the feeling of gratitude to our veterans.
It is a great honour for all of us to be here with you on these days. To be able to embrace you, shake your hand, listen to your advice, tell you the most important words of our love to you. To tell you that we admire your courage and dignity, your principle to abide by the laws of truth and justice throughout your life.
You have stuck by this high bar in times of war as well as in times of peace. You rebuilt the country, worked hard and with zeal, made friends, loved, brought up children, and knew how to value life and enjoy it. Duty to your Motherland and work for the common good have always been your most precious values.
You have passed these traditions and the feeling of patriotism on to your children and grandchildren. And this bond between generations is Russia's strength, national asset and indestructible moral pillar.
We bow down to you.
Let me propose a toast:
To the glorified generation of victors!
To the veterans of all the countries who fought against the Nazism, to their brotherhood, courage and heroic deed!
To Russia's peace and well-being!
To the Great Victory!

The discussion focussed on bilateral relations and prospects for the development of cooperation between Russia and the European Union.

With President of Czech Republic Milos Zeman.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, allow me to once again welcome you in the Kremlin.
I would like to say that it is a pleasure to know that there are politicians in Europe who are capable of directly expressing their viewpoint and of asserting and conducting an independent policy.
Mr President, you know we did not initiate the cooling in relations with Europe, and I hope that politicians like you would make it possible to not only restore them to the full, but also to move on.

I am very grateful to you for being with us today and sharing our emotions on this day – the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
Serious battles took place on the territory of the Czech Republic in which more than 50,000 Soviet soldiers and officers were killed. I would like to thank you and all our friends in your country who take care of the burial places of Soviet officers and men. This is an important and very sensitive aspect that speaks of the depth of our relations, which have gone through different times. Nevertheless, we expect to not only restore our relations with Europe in general, and with Eastern Europe and the Czech Republic, but to develop them further.
Unfortunately, we have had a certain fall in our trade turnover due to obvious developments, including mutual economic limitations. This damages everyone, there is nothing good about it, we see it and we are ready to fully restore our ties.
Thank you very much for coming to Moscow today.
President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman
(in Russian): Thank you, Mr President.
You know, politics are like the weather: it cools off and then it gets warmer. A person is happy when it warms up after a cool-down. This is one thing.
The other is that I have stated several times in public that I am here primarily to pay tribute not only to those soldiers who died on the territory of the Czech Republic, but to all the 20, or some say 27 million Soviet citizens, both soldiers and civilians, who died during the Great Patriotic War. This was the first purpose of my visit.
As you surely know, I am confident that normal relations will follow the cool-down. Why speak of super-normal relations? What are they? Normal ties are cultural, political and economic ties. Since every president protects the interests of his nation, I am here to protect the interests of the Czech Republic. I don’t want to speak of the whole world the way the UN Secretary-General does.
As for economic interests, they are very simple. I do not know if you remember our first meeting 15 years ago – I was visiting you in your capacity of Prime Minister. I was already performing all the political functions, though I had never been a mayor. I said “We have a minor point” and you said there were no minor points. We also spoke of a gas pipeline somewhere in Kamchatka then. It had to do with an unpaid loan. You resolved it in 14 days. Congratulations.
Some problems recur, as usual. I am certain that the sanctions are a short-term affair. I publicly spoke against the sanctions.
Vladimir Putin: We know that.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, allow me to once again welcome you in Moscow. Thank you for accepting the invitation and coming to Moscow to celebrate the 70th Victory anniversary.
I would like to use this opportunity to yet again congratulate you, Mr President, and all the people of Vietnam on the 40th anniversary of the restoration of your country’s territorial integrity, the reunification of the country’s north and south. My congratulations go not only to the entire friendly Vietnamese people, but to you personally as a participant in combat action. The people of Vietnam know like no other people the trials brought by war and the value of peace.

This year we mark another date – the 65th anniversary of the restoration of our diplomatic relations. We maintain a very rhythmic political dialogue and develop our strategic partnership. I am very happy to have this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations with you.
President of Vietnam Truong Tan Sang (retranslated): Comrade Putin, comrades, first, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to meet with you, despite your very busy schedule these days.
I would also like to use this opportunity to congratulate you on behalf of our leadership on the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
We highly value this victory. It laid the foundation for the struggle for independence by various peoples of the world – in Asia, Africa and America. It also became a precondition for the victory of our revolution in August 1945.
This is also a chance to confirm the traditional nature of relations between our two countries. We would like to further these relations – this is one of the key priorities of our foreign policy.
We are fully aware of the fact that everything Vietnam has achieved today is, of course, a result of maximum efforts on the part of the Vietnamese people, however Vietnam also accepted help and assistance from its international friends, including Russia.
It was a great honour for us to take part in the parade on Red Square this morning. We could feel the spirit of victory. All the songs, the music we heard today in Red Square are also very dear to us, Vietnamese people.

Interview to Rossiya television channel
Following the events celebrating the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, Vladimir Putin answered questions from Sergei Brilev, anchor of the Vesti v Subbotu (News on Saturday) programme on Rossiya television channel.

Anchor of the Vesti v Subbotu programme on Rossiya television channel Sergei Brilev: Mr President, did you see everyone you hoped to see at the parade today?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Do you mean the guests, or everyone in general who came to the parade?
Sergei Brilev: Let’s start with the guests. At one point, we were expecting the Americans and Europeans to come after all, but in the end they did not. Did this disappoint you?
Vladimir Putin: No. It makes me happy that around the world people are celebrating the Day of Victory over Nazism. I think that no matter where people are celebrating, if this is a genuine holiday for them, this is already a good thing.
There were veterans from the United States and Britain present today at the reception at the Kremlin. They came up and spoke very warm and friendly words. These were people who took part in the northern convoys, in the Normandy landing and in the fighting in Europe. We saw everyone we hoped to see here.
The main thing is for people to understand that the fight against Nazism was very important and that it was a very important milestone in human history.
As for what we saw today, I want to say that we saw many happy faces, our fellow citizens’ faces, and this is the main thing. We see May 9 as our great holiday, perhaps the most important date of all in our country’s history.
Finally, you saw the event today, the public event that was given the name The Immortal Regiment. People carried portraits of their loved ones, their fathers, mothers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers. People carried these portraits across Red Square.
Sergei Brilev: When did you decide to join in this event and walk together with the people?
Vladimir Putin: I can’t say that it was just a last-minute decision, but it was something I had not really thought about. Later, I learned that the march would take place right on Red Square and I decided that I would take part too. After all, my father was just an ordinary soldier, but it was the courage, blood and bodies of the ordinary Soviet soldiers that paved the road to Victory.
When we carry their photos, it is our way of paying tribute to all that they did for our country. At the same time, we realise that the responsibility for Russia now lies on our shoulders. We must be worthy of the feat of our fathers and grandfathers.
Sergei Brilev: Thank you, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Happy holiday!

Thank you for accepting our invitation and coming to attend the events to mark the 70th anniversary of the victory over Nazism.

We are grateful to you, Mr Secretary-General, and to all the people working in this universal international organisation for your efforts to ensure world peace.
Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon
(in Russian): Thank you, Mr President. I am very happy to be in Moscow again. Thank you for your welcome.
(in English): We are honoured to participate in this historic event of Victory Day. And thank you for your invitation and also Director-General of UNESCO, Madame Irina Bokova, is here.
I am humbled and I was very excited to commemorate the great contribution and sacrifice Russian people had to make 70 years ago in defence of freedom and peace and liberty. That was a huge tragedy, but a very valuable contribution for humanity.
70 years after, today I was able to witness myself the proud faces and the strong commitment for peace by not only soldiers who participated in it, but by people who were watching and were a part of this event. Congratulations for your leadership and vision.
After this parade I saw hundreds of thousands people still in the street. I thought they were demonstrating against government, but they were supporting your leadership, they were very proud citizens. And they were waving hands to the United Nations, so I was also honoured. I think you deserve all this pride of your people.
Mr President, I think this World War was a tragedy, unspeakable tragedy. But it also made people resolve to create the United Nations. The United Nations is also celebrating the 70th anniversary this year. Therefore, my participation in this parade as Secretary-General of the United Nations means that we are working together for humanity and world peace and freedom.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, allow me to once again welcome you in Moscow. Thank you for accepting our invitation to take part in celebrations marking the 70th Victory anniversary.

I am very happy to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the development of our relations in various areas.
We are very happy to see you, Mr President.
President of India Pranab Mukherjee
(retranslated): Mr President,
First I would like to congratulate you on Victory Day in the Great Patriotic War. We know the important role the Soviet Union played in those years. It was the country that dealt the decisive final blow and destroyed the forces of Nazism and fascism.
I would also like to congratulate you on the wonderful celebration of Victory Day.
We recall your visit to India, when we met and you also had a meeting with our Prime Minister. I would like to thank you for your invitation to take part in today’s celebrations.
I would also like to convey warm greetings and best wishes from our Prime Minister to you personally and to the people of the Russian Federation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, dear Jacob, allow me to welcome you once again.
I am very happy to see our friends in Moscow during the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
Relations between Russia and South Africa are of a special nature: this is our leading partner on the African continent.
We are developing our relations within the framework of international organisations, including BRICS
. We need to do a lot to make sure that this organisation becomes an effective mechanism for developing our economies. And we have everything we need for this.
In any case, we are very happy to see you. I am happy to have the opportunity to discuss bilateral issues.
President of South Africa Jacob Zuma
: Mr President,let me thank you very much firstly for the invitation. We were given a very warm reception and hospitality since the arrival of our delegation.
When it comes to the commemoration today, it has been an overwhelmingly good day and a big day for the country, but I think for many of us. I think it defines how the globe stands today to some degree and I think it is very clear, and to have so many good friends come together.
To us in South Africa it is extraordinarily more important, given our history with this country, our relations now and where we are looking forward to develop our relations bilaterally.
I think this has been one of the days that defined the friends and relationships and everything. I think today it was clearer than any other day.
From the point of view of bilateral relations, we are very committed.

Relations between Russia and Egypt have been developing dynamically. They are based on a solid foundation of friendship, cooperation and a strong historical background. We know that Egypt and you as its leader are facing grand tasks.

I am very happy to be here with you on this wonderful day. Nobody can deny the role that Russia, the Soviet Union played in combatting Nazism, and it will remain in history.

We are very interested in strengthening relations with the Russian Federation and with you personally, Mr President. Together we can create and implement a lot. There are many areas we can cooperate in, including combatting terrorism and developing the economy.
Russian-Egyptian relations have a long history and they are becoming stronger every day.
Thank you once again, Mr President, for your invitation to attend today’s events and for everything you are doing for our country. This gratitude comes not only from me, but from the entire Egyptian people. We are speaking of the strong relations that unite us.
Thank you, Mr President.
