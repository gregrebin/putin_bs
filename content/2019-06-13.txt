President of Kyrgyzstan Sooronbay Jeenbekov
: Mr President, welcome to Kyrgyzstan.
I am pleased to meet with you again. I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate the people of Russia on Russia Day; it is a major holiday. We are happy to welcome you here; you are always our welcome guest. We have always believed and said that Russia and Vladimir Putin are Kyrgyzstan’s best, most reliable friend.
Thank you very much.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your invitation, Mr President.
At the outset of our work, I would like to wish success to this great, large-scale international event that you have organised and started hosting. Every country participating in our Organisation’s work is interested in a positive outcome of this work. Not only in the participating countries, but also in the rest of the world there is a great deal of attention and interest in this event. In that sense, Bishkek has become a centre of international activities to a certain extent.
Organising such a large-scale, big event at the proper level is no easy task. I am sure everything will be at the highest level. I know you paid a lot of attention personally to ensure this. I would like to wish you the best of luck.
Sooronbay Jeenbekov: Thank you for your support in organising this summit. Russia’s technical assistance came just in time and has been fully utilised in hosting the summit.
Thank you very much.
