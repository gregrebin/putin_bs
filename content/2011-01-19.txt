King Abdullah II of Jordan: Your Excellency, if you allow me to welcome you to Jordan.
We have always enjoyed a very special and warm relationship between our two countries that were built by His Majesty the Late King Hussein. It has been an honor for me to have develop that relationship with my Russian colleagues. We have known each other for several years. We truly welcome your presence here in Jordan and we are also very excited about the new levels of cooperation between our two countries especially in the economic fields. And we will have an opportunity to discuss this in greater detail later today.
We welcome Russia’s extremely important role in Middle East affairs you have played, an important role in bringing stability to the region, and more importantly your country’s very strong will in a peace process. We all believe, as you do, in the future of the two state solution, an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. And we continue to welcome active Russian engagement which is so critical to the future stability of this region and your prominent role in bringing Israelis and Palestinians together.
As a friend and as a colleague I personally welcome you to Jordan. I hope this is the first visit of many visits to our country. And we are very-very delighted to have you and your delegation here in Jordan. Thank you.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Your Majesty, it is truly my pleasure to be here in Jordan on my first visit, because we consider Jordan a friendly nation. We are bound by an enormous number of various cooperative and other opportunities. We often meet, in Russia and in other places during international forums, and naturally, it benefits the development of the multifaceted economic and humanitarian relations between our countries.
Yesterday evening, you and I began discussing these matters and will continue our discussion now. We are optimistic about development of our relations, and we believe they will be most advantageous and mutually beneficial for our states.
I am coming here following a visit to the Palestinian Authority. That is certainly a major, serious topic to be addressed. Yesterday, I had talks with President Abbas and I think that we can and must do everything to bring peace to the Middle East. Russia has been and will remain a co-sponsor of this process. We understand our responsibility and will continue to act in accordance with the decisions that the international community has made. The ultimate goal is unquestionably the establishment of an independent, modern, unified Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem, as I said yesterday to our Palestinian friends.
I would like to once again thank you, Your Majesty, for welcoming our delegation to your wonderful country today. I am certain that we will now continue our talks to our mutual benefit.
