Speech at concert celebrating National Unity Day
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good evening, friends,
We warmly greet you and congratulate you on our state holiday, National Unity Day.
Vladimir Putin and I have truly enjoyed spending this day in Nizhny Novgorod, here at the Gorky Automobile Plant, because this holiday essentially originates from this area, the birthplace of the volunteer corps, which ultimately saved our country. Of course, it is very important that this day symbolises the unity of our nation, the fact that we sometimes face problems, but we all work together to resolve them.
I hope that you are in good spirits today. This is a very bright, sunny day, and a number of performers have come to your celebration. We just saw the new line of products released by this plant, and heard about its plans for the future.
I am absolutely certain that our plant, our pride – the Gorky Automobile Plant – has a bright future. And we will do everything to ensure that the people working here feel that they are needed, and for everyone to be in a good mood, not just during celebrations.
I want to once again sincerely congratulate you and wish you all the best on the National Unity Day.
