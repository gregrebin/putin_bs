President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
I wanted to meet with you. We actually agreed on this when I was at the White House after the decision to change the Government was made. I said I wanted to meet with everyone here, and now here we are. I am meeting with some of our colleagues who have stayed in the Government or are moving to new roles primarily to thank them for their cooperation over the years.
The Government, led by Mr Medvedev, operated in a difficult environment, confronted by numerous challenges, but I think plans are never fulfilled 100 percent. Overall, I believe that the Government accomplished a lot of important things to promote the country’s long-term strategic development.
Determining the goals of national development and developing a mechanism for achieving these goals in the form of national projects was not easy. Comprehensive and diverse efforts to expand the country's economy and social sphere were not easy, either. Nevertheless, a lot has been accomplished.
I want to thank you once again and express hope that you will use your potential and your extensive personal and professional experience in your new assignments to move forward on a personal level and to address the tasks that will be set for you. I believe we will form a large tight-knit team. I am counting on you and I know that it will be interesting for you and good for the country.
Almost everyone here knows where they will work next, but there remain just a couple of subtle points. I think we will finalise them during today's meeting. Thank you very much again, and I wish you all the best in your new positions.
