We also spoke about the possibility for Vnesheconombank to set up a “project factory.” I would like to hear from Mr Oreshkin how this work is progressing, and what has been happening in real terms since we spoke about it.
Economic Development Minister Maxim Oreshkin:
It is significant that inflation has gone down: the latest figure is 3.1 percent. This has allowed the Central Bank to cut the interest rate. Their latest decision was to cut the interest rates by 50 basis points. In general, this opens the way to further increasing lending operations by the banking system. We are already witnessing a record-breaking dynamics in mortgage loans, if we discount seasonal factors. And increased economic activity in the autumn months will lead to an actual, nominal increase in lending volumes. This must provide good support to the construction and construction materials industries during the autumn and up to early next year. The industries that experienced a plunge in the past two or three years are actively recovering now. The mortgage boom we are expecting will help recovery here and will on the whole contribute positively to economic growth.
Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov: Thank you, Mr President,
