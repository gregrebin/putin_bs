Press statements following Russian-Ecuadorian talks. With President of Ecuador Rafael Correa.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President,
Our talks with our friends from Ecuador, with the delegation headed by President Rafael Correa, have just ended. We discussed all bilateral issues in detail and exchanged views on some international ones.
Relations between our countries are developing on the basis of the principles enshrined in our Strategic Partnership Declaration. One of its central themes is the expansion of trade and economic ties. Ecuador is one of Russia’s leading partners in Latin America. Our trade has doubled over the past five years, reaching $1.3 billion, and in the first 8 months of this year it increased by another 11 percent.
Today we talked about how it’s imperative that we diversify our ties and develop investment cooperation. We just signed an agreement on financing a gas turbine power generation unit and a steam turbine at Termogas Machala thermal power plant in Ecuador. Inter RAO will work on implementing this project from the Russian side. New projects worth approximately $1.5 billion are coming up.
”I am confident that the partnership between Russia and Ecuador will continue to flourish for the benefit of our nations, and help further peace and stability.“
We also discussed the possibility of attracting Russian businesses to get involved in implementing major industrial programmes in Ecuador, including in infrastructure, particularly railway infrastructure. Our countries have great opportunities to cooperate in prospecting and extracting hydrocarbons. During our talks we paid special attention to cooperation in high-tech sectors.
Russia and Ecuador successfully cooperate in combating organised crime and drug trafficking. We intend to continue to actively cooperate in the fight against terrorism financing, money laundering, and cybercrime.
Our cultural, educational and scientific links are growing stronger. We will continue the practice of providing scholarships to Ecuadorian undergraduate and graduate students. At present more than 4,000 Ecuadorians have been educated in our country.
Today active integration processes are underway in Latin America, and Russia is interested in expanding contacts with regional associations there.
In conclusion, I want to thank President Correa for the detailed and useful conversation. I am confident that the partnership between Russia and Ecuador will continue to flourish for the benefit of our nations, and help further peace and stability.
Thank you very much for your attention.

Meeting with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening! I am very happy to see you.
First of all, I want to congratulate you on receiving the title of Honorary Professor of the Diplomatic Academy of Russia.
You are more than just a long-time veteran of diplomatic service and related work – you have been involved in global politics for nearly your entire life. You have many friends in Russia – our foreign policy veterans, and people who always follow your assessments of developments in the world and various regions with great interest. So presenting you with the title of Honorary Professor of the Diplomatic Academy of Russia is fully justified.
Let me congratulate you once more, and I am very glad to see you again.
Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: Thank you very much, Mr President, for receiving me, in the midst of a very busy period.
I’ve been coming to Russia for over 50 years. And things change, but the basic necessity that our two countries should find a way to cooperate remains ever stronger. And over the years, you have been very generous with your time, to explain your thinking and the Russian point of view to me. And you can be sure that I transmit it to the highest levels in the United States.
When you say kind things about my writing, it doesn’t always help me in the United States. But I appreciate it. And I’ve had very interesting talks here, which actually make me very hopeful. So thank you for receiving me.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, dear friends and colleagues, we are very happy to see you and welcome you to Moscow.
I am very pleased to welcome Ecuador’s President to Russia’s capital. Your country is one of our most important Latin American partners.
Relations between our countries are developing very successfully. Our trade is very decent: nearly $1.5 billion – $1.3 billion to be precise – and continues to grow despite all the problems in the global economy. It rose by more than 10 percent in the first half of this year.
We have a lot of promising, exciting projects, and today we’ll talk about all of them. I am very pleased to have this opportunity, Mr President. Welcome.
President of Ecuador Rafael Correa
(translated from Russian): Thank you very much, Mr President.
We are very pleased to visit Russia – a wonderful, great country – again.
Yesterday we visited St Petersburg, one of the world’s most beautiful cities. Who can forget such a terrible event as the Siege of Leningrad that lasted almost 900 days, where people preferred to die of hunger and cold rather than giving up or capitulating to Nazism!
And today we are visiting Moscow, a great capital. It is also a heroic city, a city that won the war against Napoleon and the Second World War. For us it is a great honour to be in such a heroic city, indeed in this heroic country. And happy circumstances make that it is also a country with many ties to Ecuador.
Russia is our third largest trading partner, among those not trading oil. We can also boast that Russia has made very large, significant investments in Ecuador. We have many beneficial projects which, in addition to creating profits for our countries, also further Ecuador’s development. And one example of such cooperation is a very important hydroelectric power plant called Toachi Pilaton.
Ecuador is a developing country. And while we really have done many things together with the Russian Federation, we are confident there is much more to do. We can work in our Gulf [of Guayaquil], in the southeast of the country, and develop mineral deposits. And there are many more things we can do together. I think that people’s skills, science and technology are very important, crucial for our relations, and in Russia much is available of the very highest quality. So I hope that during this visit we can deepen and improve our cooperation in these areas.
We can also improve our scholarship programmes, as well as programmes between our two cities of knowledge: Skolkovo in Russia and Yachay in Ecuador.
Mr President, thank you very much once again for receiving us with such warmth and cordiality. Thank you very much.

Presenting Russian Federation state decorations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear friends,
Following tradition, today the ceremony awarding state decorations is taking place in the Kremlin. And as always in these cases, there is a sense of pride here in the great achievements represented in this hall: pride in your talent, your work, your successes, and the outstanding outcomes of your work. In the run-up to National Unity Day, we are particularly aware of the importance and significance of these achievements. And especially of their role in consolidating our multi-ethnic nation around the values of patriotism, allegiance to the Motherland, and responsibility for its fate.
Here today there are figures from science, culture, art and fashion; there are workers from industrial sectors, healthcare and education; and there are diplomats, law enforcement officers, and entrepreneurs who have high standards for efficiency and social responsibility.
I sincerely want to thank you all for your work and contribution to our country’s development. And I would like to say a special word to the older generation. For us, naturally you are an example of professional duty, honesty, and uncompromising, dedication to your vocation. Whatever Russia’s fate, whatever historic changes it experienced, you always faithfully served the Fatherland. The creative biographies of Yury Lyubimov and Vladimir Etush, as well as their service in World War II, bear witness to this. We admire your energy, optimism, efficiency and talent. Famous directors and actors such as Tatyana Doronina, Mark Zakharov, Inna Churikova, Alexander Zbruyev, Margarita Terekhova and Dmitry Pevtsov carefully preserve the traditions of Russia’s theatrical school. Each of you has his or her own artistic credo, style and way of opening new horizons in the theatrical arts. But you are all loved and respected by your audiences, which is the best evidence of your talent and creative work.
The title National Artist of Russia is being conferred today on Chulpan Khamatova. We all know you not only as a wonderful actress, but as a person who, for many, many years now, has responded to the call of your heart and helped gravely ill children. Faina Zakharova, head of the Lifeline charitable foundation, commits similar selfless deeds. She is being awarded the decoration For Good Deeds.
”Each of you has not only made a significant contribution to Russia’s development, but your lives indicate respect for values such as professional and civic duty, respect for the traditions of our ancestors, and the desire for honest and constructive work.“
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to Syria Azamat Kulmukhametov is being awarded the Order of Courage. In difficult conditions, Mr Kulmukhametov and his colleagues demonstrated unwavering firmness and integrity when protecting the interests of their Motherland.
For military valour, courage and utmost professionalism while performing critical tasks, the Order for Services to the Fatherland, IV degree is awarded to the commander of Rys special rapid reaction unit, Colonel Vladimir Yershov. A military officer, he served for more than 25 years, and since 1993 has passed through virtually all so-called hot spots, and participated in the liberation of the hostages from Dubrovka Theatre. Such people are the honour and pride of our law enforcement agencies.
Dear friends,
Each of you has not only made a significant contribution to Russia’s development, but your lives indicate respect for values such as professional and civic duty, respect for the traditions of our ancestors, and the desire for honest and constructive work. You directly influence the creation of an atmosphere of mutual understanding and civic responsibility in our society.
A great deal of work to strengthen the harmony and development of interfaith dialogue is being carried out by leaders of Russia’s traditional religious organisations, [Supreme Mufti of Russia] Talgat Tadzhuddin and [Chief Rabbi of Russia] Adolf Shayevich. What you are doing is very important for our multinational country, for the unity of the large, multi-ethnic Russian people, and for strengthening our country’s spiritual power and greatness.
Today I am glad to welcome our great, longstanding friend, sports expert from Italy and head coach of the Russian national judo team, Mr Ezio Gamba. He has done a lot for the sport’s development. At the London Olympic Games, our judo team achieved completely unprecedented results in the history of the Olympic movement.
I sincerely congratulate all those receiving state decorations today. They reflect the extent to which our society and people appreciate you.
I wish you further significant, important, brilliant successes!
Thank you very much for your attention.
