Press statements following Russian-Ecuadorian talks. With President of Ecuador Rafael Correa.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President,
Our talks with our friends from Ecuador, with the delegation headed by President Rafael Correa, have just ended. We discussed all bilateral issues in detail and exchanged views on some international ones.
Relations between our countries are developing on the basis of the principles enshrined in our Strategic Partnership Declaration. One of its central themes is the expansion of trade and economic ties. Ecuador is one of Russia’s leading partners in Latin America. Our trade has doubled over the past five years, reaching $1.3 billion, and in the first 8 months of this year it increased by another 11 percent.
Today we talked about how it’s imperative that we diversify our ties and develop investment cooperation. We just signed an agreement on financing a gas turbine power generation unit and a steam turbine at Termogas Machala thermal power plant in Ecuador. Inter RAO will work on implementing this project from the Russian side. New projects worth approximately $1.5 billion are coming up.
”I am confident that the partnership between Russia and Ecuador will continue to flourish for the benefit of our nations, and help further peace and stability.“
We also discussed the possibility of attracting Russian businesses to get involved in implementing major industrial programmes in Ecuador, including in infrastructure, particularly railway infrastructure. Our countries have great opportunities to cooperate in prospecting and extracting hydrocarbons. During our talks we paid special attention to cooperation in high-tech sectors.
Russia and Ecuador successfully cooperate in combating organised crime and drug trafficking. We intend to continue to actively cooperate in the fight against terrorism financing, money laundering, and cybercrime.
Our cultural, educational and scientific links are growing stronger. We will continue the practice of providing scholarships to Ecuadorian undergraduate and graduate students. At present more than 4,000 Ecuadorians have been educated in our country.
Today active integration processes are underway in Latin America, and Russia is interested in expanding contacts with regional associations there.
In conclusion, I want to thank President Correa for the detailed and useful conversation. I am confident that the partnership between Russia and Ecuador will continue to flourish for the benefit of our nations, and help further peace and stability.
Thank you very much for your attention.

Meeting with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening! I am very happy to see you.
First of all, I want to congratulate you on receiving the title of Honorary Professor of the Diplomatic Academy of Russia.
You are more than just a long-time veteran of diplomatic service and related work – you have been involved in global politics for nearly your entire life. You have many friends in Russia – our foreign policy veterans, and people who always follow your assessments of developments in the world and various regions with great interest. So presenting you with the title of Honorary Professor of the Diplomatic Academy of Russia is fully justified.
Let me congratulate you once more, and I am very glad to see you again.
Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: Thank you very much, Mr President, for receiving me, in the midst of a very busy period.
I’ve been coming to Russia for over 50 years. And things change, but the basic necessity that our two countries should find a way to cooperate remains ever stronger. And over the years, you have been very generous with your time, to explain your thinking and the Russian point of view to me. And you can be sure that I transmit it to the highest levels in the United States.
When you say kind things about my writing, it doesn’t always help me in the United States. But I appreciate it. And I’ve had very interesting talks here, which actually make me very hopeful. So thank you for receiving me.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, dear friends and colleagues, we are very happy to see you and welcome you to Moscow.
I am very pleased to welcome Ecuador’s President to Russia’s capital. Your country is one of our most important Latin American partners.
Relations between our countries are developing very successfully. Our trade is very decent: nearly $1.5 billion – $1.3 billion to be precise – and continues to grow despite all the problems in the global economy. It rose by more than 10 percent in the first half of this year.
We have a lot of promising, exciting projects, and today we’ll talk about all of them. I am very pleased to have this opportunity, Mr President. Welcome.
President of Ecuador Rafael Correa
(translated from Russian): Thank you very much, Mr President.
We are very pleased to visit Russia – a wonderful, great country – again.
Yesterday we visited St Petersburg, one of the world’s most beautiful cities. Who can forget such a terrible event as the Siege of Leningrad that lasted almost 900 days, where people preferred to die of hunger and cold rather than giving up or capitulating to Nazism!
And today we are visiting Moscow, a great capital. It is also a heroic city, a city that won the war against Napoleon and the Second World War. For us it is a great honour to be in such a heroic city, indeed in this heroic country. And happy circumstances make that it is also a country with many ties to Ecuador.
Russia is our third largest trading partner, among those not trading oil. We can also boast that Russia has made very large, significant investments in Ecuador. We have many beneficial projects which, in addition to creating profits for our countries, also further Ecuador’s development. And one example of such cooperation is a very important hydroelectric power plant called Toachi Pilaton.
Ecuador is a developing country. And while we really have done many things together with the Russian Federation, we are confident there is much more to do. We can work in our Gulf [of Guayaquil], in the southeast of the country, and develop mineral deposits. And there are many more things we can do together. I think that people’s skills, science and technology are very important, crucial for our relations, and in Russia much is available of the very highest quality. So I hope that during this visit we can deepen and improve our cooperation in these areas.
We can also improve our scholarship programmes, as well as programmes between our two cities of knowledge: Skolkovo in Russia and Yachay in Ecuador.
Mr President, thank you very much once again for receiving us with such warmth and cordiality. Thank you very much.
