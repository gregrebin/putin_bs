Speech at the Military Parade in Honour of the 60th Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War
May 9, 2005
10:40
Red Square, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear citizens of Russia!
Distinguished guests!
Comrade soldiers and sailors, sergeants, sergeant-majors and warrant officers!
Comrade officers, generals and admirals!
I congratulate you on this, the sixtieth anniversary of our great victory! I congratulate you on this celebration of peace and triumph of justice, this day that marks the victory of good over evil and of freedom over tyranny.
Sixty years have now passed. But every year on May 9 the memory of the war appeals to our reason, committing us to great responsibility and making us realise with more acuteness just how close the world came at that time to plunging into an irreversible abyss. On this day we see more clearly just what monstrous consequences violence, racial intolerance, genocide and outrage committed against people could have had.
We will never forget that these enormities bring people nothing but fear, humiliation and death.
We will always honour all those who fought on the frontlines and those who selflessly toiled in the rear.
We will mourn the dead and pay them the debt of gratitude of those who they saved.
The Second World War caught up 61 countries and almost 80 percent of the Earth’s population in its inferno. This hurricane of fire blazed a trail of destruction not only across Europe but also across Asia and Africa. It reached all the way to Novaya Zemlya and Alaska, to the frontiers of Egypt and Australia.
But the most ruthless and decisive events — the events that determined the drama and the outcome of this inhuman war — unfolded on the territory of the Soviet Union. The Nazis counted on rapid enslavement of our people. Their intention was to destroy our country.
Their plans failed. First, the Soviet army halted the Nazi advance outside Moscow. Then, over the next three years, not only did they hold the enemy in check but were able to drive it back, back into its own lair.
The battles of Moscow and Stalingrad, the courage of besieged Leningrad and the successes at Kursk and on the Dnieper decided the outcome of World War II. Through the liberation of Europe and the battle for Berlin the Red Army brought the war to its victorious conclusion.
Dear friends!
We never divided victory into ours and theirs. We will always remember our allies – the United States, Great Britain, France and the other countries who fought in the anti-Nazi coalition, the German and Italian anti-fascists. Today we pay tribute to the courage of all Europeans who resisted Nazism.
But we also know that the Soviet Union lost tens of millions of its citizens during those years of war. And people of every nationality in the former Soviet Union were among the soldiers who gave their lives on the battlefields.
All the peoples and all the republics of the Soviet Union suffered irreplaceable losses. Grief entered every home, every family. May 9 is therefore a sacred date for all the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
We all share a common grief, common memory and common duty to future generations. It is our obligation to hand down to our descendants this spirit of historical kinship, common objectives and hopes.
I am sure that there can be no alternative to our brotherhood and friendship.
Russia seeks to build relations that are not only forged by the lessons of the past but that are also reaching out towards our common future, both with our closest neighbours and with all countries of the world.
History teaches us that states and peoples must do everything they can not to let their eyes close to the emergence of new lethal doctrines, to anything that can become fertile soil for new threats.
The lessons of the war send us the warning that indifference, temporising and playing accomplice to violence inevitably lead to terrible tragedies on a planetary scale. Faced with the real threat of terrorism today, we must, therefore, remain faithful to the memory of our fathers. It is our duty to defend a world order based on security and justice and on a new culture of relations among nations that will not allow a repeat of any war, neither “cold” nor “hot”.
Since the era of global confrontation came to an end, we have made considerable progress towards the noble aim of ensuring peace and tranquillity in Europe.
Our policy is based on the ideals of freedom and democracy and the right of every nation to choose its own path of development. Our policy is founded on trust and the search for future progress and development prospects for all peoples, including those who have traversed the difficult experience of the last confrontation and have been able to find a new road to international dialogue and cooperation.
The historic reconciliation between Russia and Germany is a shining example of this policy.
I see it as one of post-war Europe’s most valuable achievements and an example worthy of emulation in modern world politics.
Dear citizens of Russia!
Distinguished guests!
May 9 was and always will be a sacred day for our country, a celebration that not only inspires and elevates us but also fills our hearts with a most complex mix of feelings – joy and sorrow, sympathy and nobility.
It is a celebration that inspires us to the most lofty moral acts and gives us the opportunity once again to bow down before those who gave us freedom, the freedom to live, work, feel joy, create, and understand each other.
Victory Day is our closest, sincerest and most truly national holiday.
For the peoples of the former Soviet Union it will always be the day celebrating the great feats they achieved together.
And for the countries of Europe and the entire planet it marks the day when the world was saved.
Our fathers and grandfathers were willing to lay down their lives for the honour and freedom of their country. They were united and they defended their Fatherland.
I bow low today before all veterans of the Great Patriotic War and I wish them a long and happy life.
Glory to the victorious soldiers of the Great Patriotic War and the Second World War!
To the Victory Day!
Glory to Russia!
Hurrah!

Speech at a Formal Reception Dedicated to the 60th Anniversary of Victory
May 9, 2005
15:06
The State Kremlin Palace, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear veterans,
Ladies and gentlemen, heads of state and government,
Dear friends,
Today is a special day for all of us, without exaggeration. It is a sacred day for our peoples. It is one of the most memorable and important dates for their history.
On 9 May 1945, great justice was done. All of Europe believed in it and waited for it. The entire world hoped for it.
And now, when together we honour the anniversary of the Victory over fascism, we mark the Victory over a criminal regime.
Victory over a monstrous ideology that made it possible to enslave and exterminate entire peoples.
For us, it is clear that the Second World War was the most tragic event of last century. But at the same time, it was also the most heroic event of that era.
In the war on Nazism, people’s rights to freedom were won back, their rights to life itself, to an independent choice of the path of development. For their descendents, rich traditions of many centuries, the spiritual and moral culture of many peoples of Europe were preserved.
But most importantly, it was a victory of civilisation over barbarism in the form of fascism.
I would like to take this opportunity to stress once more: I am genuinely glad that we are celebrating this day together – in such a representative international group. I believe this fact is fundamentally important, and I am deeply grateful to all our guests who came to share the joy of these celebrations with us here in Moscow, the capital of Russia.
Dear colleagues and friends,
Even on this blessed day of victory we cannot forget the tremendous victims and suffering that fell to the lot of our and other peoples of the world.
As long as we remember this and value the deeds of this generation, as long as we go hand in hand, we are invincible. And together, we can defend the world from terrible new challenges and threats.
In the complex world of today we are especially aware of the excessive cost and the permanent value of the Victory of 1945. We pay our tribute to everyone who liberated the world at the cost of their lives.
In Russia, we will never forget the people who were burned in tanks and planes, who jumped out of trenches into the line of fire, who were shot and tortured. In our country we will never forget the people who were brutally persecuted by the Nazis, who were tortured and burnt alive in death camps.
We are forever grateful to everyone who passed through these enormous ordeals and torments, and overcame the enemy saving the Homeland.
Six decades later, this memory and the solidarity our people showed are still important to us. And we need a clear-sighted, lucid attitude to the lessons of war, in connection with the danger of contemporary threats.
There should be no illusions: the ideas of fascism and racial superiority still persist. They are still very strong and may, by setting nations on to fight and by duping people, lead to a new catastrophe.
Similar ideas lie at the base of extremism and terrorism, which the modern world has already encountered. And they are just as ruthless as Nazism. Understanding this, we must strengthen cooperation in the war on this evil, which genuinely threatens civilisation.
I am certain: the international community has every capability for this. A resource of cooperation has already been built up. There is an understanding of the need to prevent new dangers together. And together to oppose them.
Without exaggeration, a recognition of this was earned by suffering in the period of the Second World War. It was strengthened and built up – as we emerged from the era of global ideological confrontation. And it is required once more, in our times, during the formation of the international anti-terrorist coalition.
Dear friends,
Today we are genuinely grateful to everyone who in the terrible forties of the last century supported the Soviet Union, which took the most powerful, most brutal blow of the war. To everyone who helped us with brotherly solidarity and their aspiration to independence and freedom. Those who provided us with medicine, food and weapons.
We will never forget the courage and bravery shown in this terrible war by our allies.
We will always honour the deeds of the anti-fascist resistance in Europe.
And of course, we will remember the innumerable disasters which Nazism brought to the German people themselves. We will not forget the German anti-fascists who suffered for the ideas of a democratic, progressive future for Germany,
We all had one common enemy then – fascism. Countries and peoples of the world fought against it together. And differences in national traditions or religions, in ideology or languages, made no difference to this unity.
The victory of 1945 greatly raised the value of life itself. It called for true respect of the individual and human rights. It opened the path to the triumph of humanistic ideals and the very chance of civilised dialogue between peoples, and peaceful cooperation between nations.
It is also clear that Victory in the war of 1941–1945 was one of the most important prologues to the formation of such a unique and large-scale international structure as the UN, and to the passing of the General Declaration of human rights.
Ladies and gentlemen,
In these days of May, all veterans of the war, who are scattered all over the globe, will remember their severe youth. And they will remember their fallen comrades who remained forever on the roads of war.
But we, who have been lucky to live and work under a peaceful sky – remain eternally grateful to the fallen and to the living alike. Both to those who fought and those who kept up our home front. And we will do everything to make sure that veterans’ lives are worthy, and they have peace of mind and don’t have to worry for the future of their children and grandchildren.
Allow me to propose the first toast to them. To the veterans of the World War II and the Great Patriotic War, to everyone who brought our nations and peoples independence and prospects. To everyone who protected our historical past and gave us a future.
To you, victorious soldiers!
To a peaceful future and freedom on our planet!
To the prosperity of Russia and all the peoples of the world!
Congratulations with this great holiday!

Beginning of Meeting with Federal Chancellor of Germany Gerhard Schroeder
May 9, 2005
21:57
President hotel, Moscow
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. Mr Federal Chancellor, please allow me to give you a hearty welcome in Moscow. I am greatly pleased by your acceptance of my invitation to come here to Russia today, and join us the day we are celebrating the Victory over Nazism.
German anti-fascists were the first victims of the nazi regime, and we know it. They represented a wide range of political parties: Left parties – Communists and Social Democrats, and other trends and parties, Christian among them.
As you and I know quite well, the historical periods when our nations were together in creative efforts were the times of the European continent’s heyday. We have the best samples of our partnership to proceed from, and we have been doing so within the decade.
Allow me, dear Mr Federal Chancellor, to thank you for your contribution to the progress of Russo-German relations within the preceding years.
GERHARD SCHROEDER. Mr President, I am heartily grateful for your invitation. I regard it as an honor done my country and myself. I congratulate you on having organized extremely worthy commemorative events. I am especially grateful for the way you have greeted my wife and me.
You were right to say that the war unleashed by Nazi Germany took the heaviest-ever toll of lives of peoples within the former Soviet Union. But today, the remembrance of it is transforming into pondering together about a future we share, and that is good.
I don’t think we ought to forget – to force out of our mind – the fact that, within the preceding several decades and the recent years, we have managed to get going a genuine strategic partnership, which offers good prospects to young people of the Russian Federation and of Germany. You made an extraordinary contribution to those efforts, Mr. President, and I want to stress it. As we are here today, we are pointing out what former opponents in the war are sharing. That has a symbolical impact. It is a message and a responsibility for such things never to be re-enacted, and I am optimistic in that respect.

Beginning of Meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
May 9, 2005
19:13
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, dear colleagues,
Allow me once more to wish you a warm welcome to Moscow. I am very pleased to note the increase in Russian-Indian contacts and the development of our ties in all areas. In literally two weeks we will have the pleasure of receiving the Indian President, Mr Kalam, in Russia. And at the end of the year we expect you, dear Mr. Prime Minister. We will prepare for both the first and second event.
We have plenty to work on in widening our trade and economic ties. I think that you will agree with me that unfortunately the level of exchange of trade turnover is not what it could be between India and Russia. We could give substance to these relations, pay more attention and provide greater support to cooperation in science intensive fields.
Dear Mr Prime Minister, I remember my last visit to India. I would like to thank you for the very warm meeting and the productive talks that you organised with all the Indian colleagues.
Thank you once more for being with us today, together with the Russian people, and are celebrating this important holiday for us, the Day of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
Manmohan Singh: Mr President, for us relations with Russia are very important. I agree with you that we must continue to develop our relations, and we are very grateful to you for your personal contribution in developing our relations. Russia is our friend, who has endured the test of time, and all sections of society in India consider Russia to be our friend. For us, mutual relations with Russia have strategic importance.

Beginning of Meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
May 9, 2005
23:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
Junichiro Koizumi: I was uneasy a bit today because of the weather—but the weather was fine. We even saw a rainbow. So I am very glad the galas were a success.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Prime Minister, for finding an opportunity to be here with us today. We greatly appreciate it.
Today, we are remembering World War II victims and sacrifices. We recollect the victory over Nazism. And it matters tremendously to us that the Prime Minister of Japan – our neighbor country and long-established partner – is present at Moscow galas today.
As our talk is starting, I should like, Mr Prime Minister, to express heartfelt condolence with the recent railroad accident in Japan, in which a hundred perished. That was a tremendous tragedy.
I am glad to see our contacts making dynamic progress. The trade turnover is assuredly coming close to a nine billion dollar mark.
We are very glad to see you, Mr Prime Minister.
Junichiro Koizumi: I have just met Mr Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
If we are to look back at the past, Japan and Germany were the vanquished countries. But sixty years have passed, and brought major changes. That is the opinion we shared. Mr. Chancellor and I had the chance to meet here in Moscow. That means the previous confrontation has evolved into friendship, and we highly appreciate it.
We had a commemorative ceremony in Japan last month – in the town of Shimoda, where our diplomatic relations were established 150 years ago. Your humble servant was taking part in that ceremony.

Unveiling of a Monument to General Charles de Gaulle
May 9, 2005
20:00
De Gaulle Square, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr President,
Dear veterans,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Today, on the day marking the 60th anniversary of Victory, we are unveiling in Moscow a monument to Charles de Gaulle, a glorious son of the French people, one of the twentieth century’s outstanding statesmen and a friend of our country.
De Gaulle said, “Destiny gives each of us the fate we merit”, and so in all his actions as an individual and a politician he was guided by firm moral principles and the values of honour, duty and patriotism.
A true soldier and citizen of France, Charles de Gaulle was always faithful to the oath he had sworn. During the most difficult and dramatic time of the Nazi invasion he courageously took on immense responsibility. His historic appeal to his countrymen to continue fighting united the nation and gave people belief that victory would be theirs. And the world saw that the French did not surrender and their spirit was not broken.
The French Committee of National Liberation founded by General de Gaulle became the centre for the growing resistance against the occupying forces. France’s soldiers made an important contribution to the liberation of Europe and by right shared the triumph of victory with the allies in the anti-Nazi coalition.
We will never forget the unity forged between our peoples as they fought Nazism side by side. We will never forget their fraternity of arms, the chronicle of which counts many outstanding episodes, including the glorious road of the Normandy-Neman squadron. We will also never forget the deeds of thousands of our countrymen who fought bravely against Nazism in the ranks of the French Resistance.
Ladies and gentlemen,
For Russians, the name Charles de Gaulle embodies a free and strong France, a country that, during the post-war years, thanks to the authority, ideas and energy of this man, achieved impressive successes, joined the ranks of the world’s leading powers and was recognised as one of the greatest driving forces behind European integration.
Several decades ago now, de Gaulle spoke with great foresight of creating a Europe stretching “from the Atlantic to the Urals” and of the fact that “the need for a Franco-Russian alliance becomes apparent with every turn history takes”.
Over and over again life proves de Gaulle right. Now, in this new century, his political legacy will serve our peoples who are bound by common ideals and values and united by a common desire to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and a long-term partnership in the name of a prosperous Europe and a safe and stable world.
Happy holiday, dear friends!
Happy Victory Day!
Jacques Chirac: Dear Mr President, dear friend!
Mr Mayor, Mr Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Sixty years ago, the capitulation of Nazi Germany brought to an end one of the greatest tragedies history has known.
Never before had the world known such a ruthless and deadly war.
This morning, at the invitation of the President of the Russian Federation, we were all filled with the same emotion and remained faithful to the history and the memory of our peoples as we celebrated this peace that came at such a high cost.
Today we all remember the immense sacrifices made in the name of freeing our peoples from the yoke of Nazi barbarism. And here in Moscow we remember, of course, the decisive contribution your country made to the final victory.
The Nazis suffered their first defeats near Moscow, at Kursk and Stalingrad, and your people, showing unprecedented courage, sent a tremendous signal to the world not to give up and not to lose hope.
Our peoples and Russia played a central part in those battles. They were allies, friends and brothers-in-arms like the veterans of the Normandy-Neman Air-force Squadron. I just met with these heroes who wrote such glorious pages in history. I told them how proud we are of them, what admiration we have for them and what gratitude we feel towards them. The Free France movement, all the fighters of the Resistance, following General de Gaulle’s example, showed unshakeable determination and refused to accept defeat. The hope they inspired proved stronger than the evil fate the enemy promised.
They remained true to the end to the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. They remained true to the ideals of France. They defended the honour of our Motherland, when France was finally able to take its own destiny back into its hands.
I would like to express my gratitude to my friend, the President of the Russian Federation, to the Mayor of Moscow Mr Luzhkov, and also to the sculptor, Mr Zurab Tsereteli, for the tribute they have decided to pay to the memory of General de Gaulle. We share these feelings with them at this time, this moment of emotion, gratitude and almost reverence.
You know what place General de Gaulle holds in the hearts of the French. For all of us he is an example of what people are capable of and the incarnation of a certain idea of France. He always held aloft the image of France handed down through all the many centuries of her history. He always gave expression to France’s ambitions and desires. He embodied himself in France, returning our country to a worthy place in the world. General de Gaulle was the man who took the head of Free France. He was a statesman who passionately loved his country and always believed unfailingly in Europe and its future.
He always had the deep conviction that peace would reign again on our continent and that the peoples of Europe would make peace with each other. It was he who led France along the road to reconciliation.
With the energy that characterised him, an energy inspired by a farsighted view of history, he rejected the logic of a world divided into blocs, the logic of ideological confrontation, and he gave peoples the chance to proclaim loud and clear their desire for independence and sovereignty – a possibility they did not have.
When General de Gaulle arrived in Moscow on December 2, 1944, he visited the Russia that had always existed, the eternal Russia which, as he wrote in his memoirs, “is stronger than any theories and any regimes”. It was in this Russia, this great country, that he shared his vision of Europe and spoke of the necessity of friendship between Europe and Russia.
Remaining true to the will of General de Gaulle, we have respect for history and do not forget the suffering and trials our peoples lived through. This is why it is our duty to continue to move forward together along the European road, along the road to a Europe united on the foundation of humanist values, a Europe that is at peace with itself. The peoples of this Europe are proud of their unique past. They have forever put an end to old contentions and have overcome the dramas of the past, and today they are working together to shape their common destiny.
Today, May 9, is also Europe Day. On this day of special significance, allow me to express my certainty that tomorrow’s Europe will be even more united and stronger.
For every state, for every people of the European Union, the Constitution will become tomorrow’s foundation for creating the future they are all to forge together. The Constitution will form the foundation on which they can all calmly and confidently build solid and balanced relations with Russia decisively pursuing political, economic and social reform, thus helping to strengthen peace and democracy on our continent.
This Europe is already strong through its economic and trading power and through its flourishing science and culture. Tomorrow it will more confidently take its place as a political power. And this Europe, aware of the full extent of its responsibilities on the international stage, will act in the name of peace and development, in the name of a world order based on greater justice and solidarity, in the name of the universal human values with which our continent has enriched the entire world.
This Europe, a Europe of great ambitions, a peaceful Europe that has reached maturity after all the tragedies it has lived through, will become, I assure you, not just a partner for Russia, the great country that is Russia. This Europe will become a true friend for Russia.
Thank you for your attention.
