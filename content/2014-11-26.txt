Meeting on military planning.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
We are continuing the work we began the other day and will today examine issues related to military planning.
Over these last years, we have completed the development of an integrated military planning system, clarified our military organisation management policy and in January 2013, approved the Russian Federation Defence Plan.
As I have said before and say again now, we are not threatening anyone and have no intention of getting dragged into any geopolitical games, intrigues or conflicts, no matter who might want to drag us into such things and how.
But at the same time, we do need to ensure reliable protection of Russia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and our allies’ security.
I place particular importance on the need for a comprehensive approach and a united effort on the part of all state and government bodies in carrying out our defence tasks. 
Let’s begin work and move on to the reports.
