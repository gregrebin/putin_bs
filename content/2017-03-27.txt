Meeting with leadership of the National Guard
Vladimir Putin met with the heads of the Federal National Guard Service.

The Kremlin, Moscow
Meeting with leadership of the National Guard.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers,
I want to congratulate you on your professional holiday [National Guards’ Day] and express the hope that the decisions we have taken at the presidential and legislative levels about establishing this new federal security organisation will prove useful.
Your areas of work are of great importance: maintaining and protecting public law and order, and control over the circulation of weapons. This is very important anywhere in the world today, and important here in Russia too.
The latest terrorist attack in the Republic of Chechnya, where they attacked a national guard unit, causing victims – I ask you to pay attention to supporting the families of your colleagues who were killed – shows that control over the circulation of weapons is a critically important, even one of the most important, areas of work.
The fight against terrorism and against any terrorist manifestations, no matter where they take place, is extremely important, and all of the security and law enforcement agencies give this their utmost attention.
The National Guard’s establishment is going according to plan, and I want to thank you for this. The work is proceeding smoothly and the relevant executive order and federal law are being implemented with the hoped-for pace and quality.
We must monitor this work constantly. I count very much on your professionalism and your ability to work for results in the interests of our people.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Prime Minister. It is a great pleasure to see you in Moscow.
Let me say that our common efforts have succeeded in changing the situation in the trade and economic sector for the better, not by much as yet, but nonetheless.
We saw a slight increase of around 2 percent in bilateral trade last year. Your Government’s efforts meant that this increase was mostly thanks to growing exports from Serbia to Russia. Some sectors were leaders in this, agriculture, for example, with an increase of around 40 percent.
We have good joint projects that are developing actively, especially in the energy sector. I am sure we will discuss all of this today.
Of course, we know that Serbia will soon hold presidential elections. We are sure that in today’s Serbia, in today’s conditions, this election will be of the highest standard, and we wish good luck to the current authorities.
No matter how the political situation develops, we are sure that our bilateral relations will continue to develop just as positively, in the spirit of friendship that has characterised our ties over these last years.
Of course, we very much want to discuss with you the situation in the region today, because various outside signs suggest that a degree of escalation is taking place. We would like to discuss all of this with you today.
Welcome.
Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic
: Mr President, thank you for the warm reception and for your hospitality.
I want to say that we need to thank you personally and the Russian Federation for supporting the Republic of Serbia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. As you said, I hope and am sure that we will have plenty of opportunities to increase our bilateral trade and economic ties.
We will discuss the situation in the region. I think that this is important for both countries. It is very important that, as you know, we remain committed to our national independence, freedom and military neutrality. We will discuss together all of this and examine the steps we need to take for the future.
Once again, thank you very much for your friendship. I am absolutely certain that we will take our relations to a very high level. Thank you once again for this very warm reception.
