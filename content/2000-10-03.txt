Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to start by expressing my sincere gratitude for bestowing on me the honorary Doctorate in Law.
This is a great honour – not only because your university is recognised as one on India’s leading educational institutions, and not only because it is a research centre known worldwide, but also – which especially matters to me – because it bears the name of Jawaharlal Nehru, an outstanding Indian statesman and Russia’s friend. We cherish his memory because he came down in world history not only as the founding father of Indian statehood but as the man who laid a firm foundation of sincere and heartfelt friendship between our two nations.

Much has been said here today about the new democratic world order. I would like to support my colleague and call your attention to the following. We often hear calls to cut armaments coming from all sides. We not only agree – we have been working on that so persistently that many could follow our example. However, comprehensive global disarmament will not become a reality until the international law irreversibly triumphs in the entire world, until the global situation induces participants in international relations to rely not on the force of arms or on economic power but on the power of the law. Russia has done a great deal in this respect, and we are sure we will achieve even more together with other countries. In that sense, India is Russia’s reliable partner and ally.
Allow me once again to express my sincere heartfelt gratitude for the great honour conferred on me. I wish the university, all its professors and students, and the entire Indian nation wellbeing, prosperity and every success.
Thank you.
