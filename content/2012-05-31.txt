President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
: Mr Putin, friends,
I want to once again welcome you to your Belarus, where you certainly aren’t strangers. As President Putin just said, it is deeply symbolic that the first visit he makes is to Belarus, because Belarus is Russia’s closest and most faithful ally. This has been, is, and always will be the case. As always, we will consistently speak out in support of developing the closest possible friendly relations with our main strategic partner, the Russian Federation. This fully speaks to the will of the people of our nations.
Your visit is occurring on the eve of the 20th anniversary since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our states. This date has become an important landmark in our common history. In these years, we have travelled the serious path of building bilateral relations and reached exceptional results in this regard. Today, we can state that there is no more-advanced integration within the post-Soviet space than in the Union State. Millions of people have gotten real benefits from it. I already said that our work within the framework of the Union is also serving as the foundation for the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space.
As we noted, in 2011, the turnover between our states was 40 billion dollars, and this year, Mr Putin, you have stated that we already have a 30 per cent increase against last year’s high growth levels. Neither Russia nor Belarus has had this rate of growth with any other nation. This year, we will surpass the 40 billion dollar mark in turnover.
However, in the current context, it is imperative to provide more than continued increases in trade volume. We also need to create modern companies, which we are doing, we need to create joint holding companies, stop competing with one another at least within the framework of the Customs Union, and enter other nations’ markets together. We are ready to do this.
I am grateful to the Russians and to you, Mr Putin, for the decision you made: you supported us in building a nuclear power plant in Belarus. These are cutting-edge technologies. I was just discussing this problem with Mr Putin. I think that we need to become more active in order to build the most modern, best, most beautiful power station in the world, here in the centre of Europe. And in uniting our efforts, we will not only build a nuclear power plant, but also resolve other issues that stand before us today. Following our long-standing tradition, Mr Putin, I think we will personally monitor the most serious, breakthrough areas of our cooperation.
Just now, we had a one-on-one discussion of many problems, and we reached complete mutual understanding on these issues; naturally, we do not have any topics that are off-limits to us. We are united not only with regard to politics and the economy – we say this openly – but in military technical cooperation as well, and we will build our relations for the good of our people, without threatening anyone, without standing in anyone’s way, without creating problems for anybody. We have enough of our own problems to resolve. We are full of determination to resolve them together with the Russian people.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
I want to once again thank you for the invitation. I am very happy for the opportunity to discuss our bilateral issues in such an expanded format. Belarus Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Russia Andrei Kobyakov is looking at me – he drank so much of my blood over the last few years, and you have sent him to us in Moscow again, so that he can suck out the rest. (Laughter.)
In the past, over a short period of time we provided direct assistance to Belarus via various channels totalling about five billion dollars, and I must say that we see how Belarusian leadership and the economic bloc in the Government of Belarus are taking complicated but absolutely correct decisions to improve the economic situation. Naturally, we presume that the results the Belarusian economy is now starting to demonstrate will have a large-scale impact in the near future. We can see that right now, the Belarusian economy runs a budget surplus. Naturally, this is a very good indicator.
And I know that you have a planned GDP increase of over five per cent this year; and last year, you had very high growth as well. This is a sign that our joint efforts within the framework of the Common Economic Space are taking effect and the conscious, absolutely justified actions by the Government of Belarus are leading to this positive result. Yes, naturally, it is complicated, sometimes even painful, but this is something you must pass through.
We can see what is happening in certain European nations that did not take timely steps. Right now, they are living through very difficult times. Naturally, we wish them success in restoring their economies, but again, we welcome what is being done here in Belarus with regard to economic bloc. Naturally, we will support this disposition toward economic rehabilitation.
Our common decisions on energy resources played their role as well. After all, we went from $286 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of gas last year to $165.5 this year. We decreased prices nearly two-fold. This is significant. We also came to an agreement with regard to oil.
Mr Lukashenko and I were just talking about broadening our cooperation in infrastructure, including possible transhipment of Belarusian products in our ports in the Baltic. Overall, in terms of economic cooperation, we have done a great deal and it is reflecting positively not only on the Belarusian economy, but the Russian economy as well, because we have a very high level of cooperation and this has a positive influence on the development of the Russian economy.
And naturally, our political dialogue remains at the highest level. Just today, we were discussing with colleagues how very soon, in June, the head of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, Valentina Matviyenko, will be making a visit. State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin will also arrive, as well as the heads of various ministries and departments. So the dialogue has become very intensive and positive in nature. Let me say again, this is due significantly to the position of the Belarusian leadership with regard to this integration, this work with Russia, and thanks to the position of the President of Belarus. We are very grateful to you and happy for the opportunity to exchange views with you today on bilateral issues.

Meeting with World Chess Championship finalists Boris Gelfand (left) and Viswanathan Anand.
On May 30 Moscow hosted the FIDE World Chess Championship final, in which Viswanathan Anand defeated Boris Gelfand, retaining the title of the strongest chess player in the world.
***
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, gentlemen. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you.
First of all I want to congratulate both of you on your brilliant results and a great game that I am sure gave great enjoyment to chess fans around the world. It was an equal fight. Of course, Mr Anand scored an important victory and I am happy to congratulate him.
This is not the first time Russia hosts a FIDE world championship. I would like to thank both of you for agreeing to play in Moscow, at the State Tretyakov Gallery.
Both India and Russia, as well as the former Soviet republics, have the leading chess schools in the world. In general, chess and achievements in chess have always been a source of pride for our nation. It is no coincidence that Boris comes from the former Soviet Union, from Minsk. I am flying there tonight so I can pass on your regards to Minsk.
We have a special relationship with India and I am very pleased that an Indian national is today a leading chess player in the world. I very much hope that this will not be the last time you played together and that you will play in this country again, in different cities and not only in Moscow. Such events will certainly help to promote chess, not only in Russia but throughout the world.
I hope that you were happy with the conditions created for you here. As far as I know, you didn’t have any complaints about the organisation of the tournament.
I congratulate you once again.
Viswanathan Anand: Thank you very much.
I have a long connection with the Soviet Union and Russia. In fact, I grew up playing chess in the Soviet Cultural Centre in my hometown.
Vladimir Putin: So we’ve brought this on ourselves by raising a champion. (Laughter.)
Viswanathan Anand: I’ve been coming to Moscow from the mid-1980s to practice chess and I must admit that I have benefited immensely from interacting with Russian chess players and the school of chess here. I’ve always enjoyed my visits to Russia and this time especially the organisation was superlative.
We played in a very beautiful gallery, the Tretyakov. Overall I would say I enjoyed the Russian hospitality a lot this time.
I would like to thank Mr President for taking the time to meet us. For us, this is a great honour.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your kind words about Russia. I hope that you will visit Russia and our cities many times in the future. You are the world champion, and I am sure that chess fans, and other people as well, will always enjoy any activities with your participation.
Boris Gelfand: I grew up in Minsk and every time I came to Moscow I visited the Tretyakov Gallery, a wonderful museum, and I could not even dream that one day I will play in the world championship final in this wonderful museum and a treasury of Russian art.
In recent years, Russia and especially Moscow has once again regained its position as the capital of the chess world. And this match, which I think was the best organised match in chess history, will give a new impetus to the development of chess, because millions of people worldwide watched the game and children will grow up watching these matches.
I am very happy that there were people who took the initiative to hold this match in Moscow, the chess capital city. And the fact that you are meeting with us, Mr President, is evidence that chess is greatly appreciated and loved in Russia. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Boris, I want to add that everything I said to Mr Anand fully applies to you as well. We will always be happy to see you in Russia.
I know that you live in Israel now. We have special relations with this country as well and many immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Russia are now living in Israel. We highly value this potential. I hope to meet with you again both here and in Israel. I have an invitation from the leadership of Israel to visit the country as there is a very good reason. So, I hope we can meet here and in your new home country.
Once again, congratulations to both of you on these remarkable achievements. I think this is the achievement of both players. The competition was intense and equal. The history of chess has seen many different situations, but here you were neck and neck. That is certainly impressive.
Once again, all the best to you both.

Press statements following Russian-Belarusian talks.
President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
: Friends,
Today, Mr Putin and I had a very constructive and substantive discussion concerning all areas of cooperation between Belarus and Russia, which was also attended by cabinet members from both sides. This was a trust-based dialogue that has taken shape and is supported by our nations, allowing us to reach significant results in all areas of our cooperation.
This visit by Mr Putin is taking place two decades after the formation of our two states and the establishment of diplomatic relations. In this time, we have reached certain results, which we just discussed; in politics, we have our alliance project, in the economy we have a yearly increase in turnover of nearly 40 per cent, and we are the Russian Federation’s sixth partner in terms of trade. Last year, our turnover was over $40 billion.
We have established very good relations with Russia’s regions. The governors visit us, and our governors and Belarusian cabinet members cooperate with specific companies and regions in the Russian Federation. We have a very intensive on-going dialogue on all issues, and today, we noted that there are no off-limits issues in our relations with our strategic partner.
”Our meeting was very business-minded, concrete and specific. We spoke as colleagues, as friends about all the issues and problems that interest both Belarus and Russia within the context of our integration efforts and bilateral relations.“
We spent a great deal of time today discussing problems pertaining to the Eurasian Union; we addressed problems in creating the Eurasian Economic Space – here, Belarus and Russia did not have any difference in opinion. I think the creation of a Eurasian Union is a matter of time and will be resolved in the near future.
Moreover, following the President of Russia’s pre-election statement proposing the creation of a common economic zone with the European Union spanning from Lisbon to Vladivostok, in supporting this initiative, we spoke out about creating an integration of integrated unions, because we have a union, and so does the European Union, an integrated structure itself. And if we unite these integrated structures, from Lisbon to Vladivostok, we would have a common economic space. Given the processes that have been occurring recently, I think the goal we have set is not so distant.
Today, we discussed many concrete issues pertaining to relations between Belarus and Russia, ranging from the economy and political matters to the defence of our Union State and diplomatic issues.
Much has already been said about this meeting, and much more will be written. I will simply state right away: we discussed issues that will improve the lives of our people. We got together in order to make our peoples’ lives better without creating problems for anyone. And we did not diverge from these issues at all. We – both Russia and Belarus – want to live on our own accounts, without creating problems for other nations. I wanted to go ahead and say this. And we discussed all the issues in this context: from tariffs to common projects for creating joint Belarusian-Russian enterprises and holding companies on the territory of the Common Economic Space.
Mr Putin, I am very grateful to you for this visit. I told you this when we were driving and I want to repeat it in public: this visit is more important than many economic agreements between Belarus and Russia, as well as with other nations. This is a signal that we have a great future ahead of us. As for Belarus, we will follow this path admirably.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Mr Lukashenko, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
Our meeting was very business-minded, concrete and specific. And, as usual in our meetings, it was very sincere. We spoke as colleagues, as friends, as comrades about all the issues and problems that interest both Belarus and Russia within the context of our integration efforts and bilateral relations.
In this regard, of course, I should say that the very fact of my first foreign visit to the brotherly nation of Belarus certainly reflects the particular nature of our relations. My meeting with Mr Lukashenko once again served as proof of our mutual readiness to develop these relations and imbue them with new context.ness-minded, concrete and specific. Andemen,
e have a great future ahead of us. As for Belarus, en Belarus and Russia, as we
During the talks, we had a detailed discussion of our prospects for developing economic ties. I want to let you know that we made a decision to offer the third credit tranche from the EurAsEC anti-crisis fund and we will begin detailed talks about a fourth tranche. We were pleased to note that this is possible, in a time-efficient and expedient manner, taking into account the positive dynamics of the Belarusian economy.
Our turnover volume also speaks to this. Mr Lukashenko already mentioned it. We had nearly $40 billion last year, and the growth in the first few months of this year is already 30 per cent. This is a very serious indicator indeed.
This result speaks to the fact that the integration processes, which are gaining momentum between our three nations – Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, – are drawing attention to themselves in a positive way.
”We once again confirmed that the cooperation strategy chosen was the right one and have agreed not to decrease the speed of moving to a qualitatively new level of integration – the Eurasian Economic Union.“
We once again confirmed that the cooperation strategy chosen was the right one and have agreed not to decrease the speed of moving to a qualitatively new level of integration – the Eurasian Economic Union.
We are expecting a serious return from implementing joint energy, engineering and advanced technology projects. In this context, I want to particularly highlight the project to construct a Belarusian nuclear power plant, which has a good chance of becoming the largest and most modern project in the history of bilateral relations.
We looked at potential directions for investment cooperation, including the creation of the Rosbelavto holding company, based on KAMAZ and MAZ assets. I am certain that if we come to an agreement, this will be a very good example for other sectors of the real economy.
We devoted significant attention to cooperation within the framework of regional alliances in the CIS in light of the anniversary session of the Collective Security Council of the CSTO and the informal CIS summit that was held two weeks ago in Moscow. We once again confirmed the similarity in our approaches to increasing the level of coordination and efficacy of collective work within the framework of these organisations. This is a priority both for Russia and for Belarus.
I also want to note our common views on current issues on the international agenda. Mr Lukashenko and I spoke about this, and we will continue the discussion in an informal setting.
I am certain that Russian-Belarusian relations have a great future. The President of Belarus and I just signed a joint statement that stresses the priority nature of our bilateral relations and our common aspirations toward active and fruitful work in all areas of our cooperation. In the near future, I plan to visit Astana, Kazakhstan, and Mr Nazarbayev and I will certainly discuss integration development prospects within the framework of the three states and moving, as I already said, in the direction of a Eurasian Union.
As our integration processes deepen, the unity of our nations will only grow stronger, opening opportunities to resolve long-term and current challenges.
I want to thank our Belarusian colleagues and you personally, Mr Lukashenko, for the warm welcome. Thank you very much for your attention.

With President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.

President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
: Mr Putin,
On the eve of the 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between Russia and Belarus, I would like to welcome you here, to Belarus. I want to thank you and the Russian leadership for everything we have achieved, especially in recent years. The main result of our political actions is the creation of a Union State, which I frequently think about.
People sometimes criticise us, saying that we are moving slowly, but I asked myself today, in preparation for this meeting: in what area have we or other nations achieved more? We do not have a border between our two nations, our people easily pass from Moscow to Minsk and vice versa, our citizens have equal rights – Russians in Belarus and Belarusians in Russia – and there are many other things. We have a common defence space, we have a common air defence, we have an allied grouping in the west that truly works and that has already held, I believe, three or four major exercises in Russia and Belarus. In other words, we have achieved clear results in all areas.
You rightly noted recently that in this regard, we must act and strengthen our state, the Union State, and promote it in various areas, beginning with the economy. Fortunately, we have practically a common economy. In broadening it, we created the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space. In other words, we applied our experience in this domain to a wider circle of nations.
Today, people are looking at us more closely. I must tell you that we have been receiving more and more information showing that whatever the unfolding situation, the Ukrainians are watching us very closely. For now, there are still some limitations, it is being discussed, but still. The President of Ukraine spoke about it at our last meeting at the Kremlin – you were present. It means that some people find this format attractive. We have done a great deal in the last two decades, and I think we have some good years ahead of us.
I am sure – and your statements made before and after the election confirm my confidence, – that the Eurasian Space vector will continue to develop and gain strengthen. We are ready for this.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
First of all, thank you for the invitation. This is my first visit since being elected and taking office as President of Russia, my first visit outside the Russian Federation. This is natural; after all, Belarus is a special partner, our close partner. The Belarusian people are certainly our closest relatives, not just through our cultural, ethnic and historic roots, but in terms of our current relations as well.
You have already talked about economic integration. I must note that in the last year, and you are well aware of this, our turnover grew by 40 per cent. This was one of the clear records in this area for both Belarus and for Russia – a turnover of 39 billion dollars.
Alexander Lukashenko: Almost 40 billion.
Vladimir Putin: In just the first four months of this year, the growth constituted almost 30 per cent. Ultimately, this is clear evidence that we made the right choice toward integration.
I have already talked about this, but I want to stress it again: this was done in large part thanks to you, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, and President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev. I want to express my particular words of gratitude to you for your position as a consistent supporter of integration processes in the post-Soviet space, both in Russia and in Belarus. Naturally, these include the Union State, and the Common Economic State, the Customs Union, and our future Eurasian Union. I am certain that we are on the right path.
I am happy for this opportunity to meet with you, to discuss not only these problems, but also our bilateral relations; we have already mentioned some of them. We have some sensitive economic and social issues, cooperation in ensuring our defence capability and security of our nations. These issues will be at the centre of our attention today. Again, thank you very much for your invitation.
