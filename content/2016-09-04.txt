President of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): It is a great pleasure to receive my old friend President Putin and all of the Russian delegation here in Hangzhou. I wish you a warm welcome to the eleventh G20 summit.
As one of the key global economies and leading countries with established markets, Russia plays a big part in promoting health and stable global economic development and developing global economic governance.
Russia successfully hosted the G20 summit in September 2013. I am sure that your participation will help us to achieve positive results at this summit too.
You made a successful visit to China in June, when we celebrated the 15th anniversary of our major bilateral treaty [on friendship, good neighbourliness and cooperation], signed and announced three important joint statements and witnessed the signing of around 30 bilateral cooperation agreements.
This clearly demonstrates our mutual commitment to deepen our comprehensive partnership and cooperation, showed in full measure that our countries share common positions on current international and regional issues, and clearly stated our common call to support global strategic stability and work for peace and security in the world.
This is exceptionally important in today’s complex and fast-changing world.
Thank you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, friends,
We celebrated the 15th anniversary of our friendship treaty this year and, during my visit to China in June, discussed in detail all different areas of our cooperation.
Our relations are developing just as well as we hoped. There are problems linked to the general global economic development situation, but there are positive aspects too. Our exports are growing overall, including in such important areas as exports of vehicles and equipment. We are grateful to you for the close attention the Chinese government gives to this work. This is improving our export and mutual trade situation in general. Of course, we do still have a lot of work to do, but I am confident that we are on the right track.
I just met in Vladivostok with members of the Chinese business community. Overall, our Chinese partners are happy with the way we are building relations on the practical level, and I am pleased to hear that the political efforts we are making at the top are producing results for those who are engaged in the real economy and are at work on the ground in this area.
We will continue pursuing our contacts at the political, parliamentary and public levels. We have youth organisations working together, tourism exchanges, and we continue our cultural cooperation.
We certainly wish our Chinese friends and you personally success with holding this G20 summit. We see how much effort you have put into preparing this big event. We support the main agenda you have set for this summit and it will be our pleasure to take part in the discussions.
Thank you very much for this welcome.

Meeting with Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madame Federal Chancellor, colleagues, good evening,
Though it’s late, I think it’s good that we have this opportunity to talk about our bilateral relations, and discuss some issues that are of mutual interest, that we are persistently working on to find solutions.
Let's try to do some work. I hope you still feel up to it.
Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel
(retranslated): Don’t worry, I’m fine. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to talk. It’s still daytime in Europe, so I'm still fresh.
I think the issues that we will discuss are so important that it’s good we have this opportunity to discuss them on a bilateral basis now. I mean, for example, Ukraine.

With Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madame Prime Minister, colleagues,
I am very pleased to meet with you in person and congratulate you on being appointed Prime Minister of Great Britain.
It is obvious to everyone that you and your team are facing some challenging tasks. But all of us are facing challenging tasks. We sincerely wish you success and hope we can take our bilateral relations to a higher level relative to where they are now.
And here we certainly have much to do – both in the political and economic spheres.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May
: Thank you very much for your welcome, Mr President. And I am pleased to have the opportunity to meet you for the first time. And we meet after an important event has taken place. I am pleased that Princes Anne was able to attend Arkhangelsk for the ceremony, which recognised the Arctic convoys.
As you say, the United Kingdom, following its decision to leave the European Union, has some challenges ahead, but we will make a success of this. But as you also say, there are many challenges in the world that are faced today. And while I recognise there will be some differences between us, there are some complex and serious areas of concern and issues to discuss, I hope we will be able to have a frank and open relationship and dialogue.

Meeting with French President Francois Hollande.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
It’s good that we have found the time to meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, as it provides an opportunity to discuss bilateral relations and issues that we consider pressing and that we are working to resolve.
We have already spent enough time talking about international and global economic problems – so now let’s turn to small, modest issues that concern both France and Russia.
President of France Francois Hollande
(retranslated): Mr President, dear Vladimir,
I looked forward to meeting with you personally during the G20, because political problems have economic implications, because, when there is war, when there are conflicts, terrorism and refugees – all this has consequences for the economy, not to mention the people’s suffering when they face such problems.
I would also like to discuss preparations for the October visit to France you are planning. This visit will include a series of symbolic gestures, such as the inauguration of the Russian centre.
Also, I think we should discuss the situations in Syria and Ukraine, since we are all involved in addressing these problems. As for Ukraine, we need to discuss further cooperation in the Normandy format. As for Syria, here we need to move towards full-fledged dialogue. Despite certain military decisions already adopted by all parties, we still need to work towards resolving the crisis by political means. I think we all share a common goal, which is to combat terrorism.
