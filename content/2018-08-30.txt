reported steady economic growth in the region. The economy grew by 4 percent in 2017, and a similar result is expected in 2018. Moscow Region ranks second among Russian regions in gross regional product, which stands at about 4 trillion rubles. Budget revenue is stable, and the region’s population grows by 90,000–95,000 people every year, reaching now a total of 7.5 million.
The Governor went on to say that a programme to build kindergartens and schools is underway in keeping with the President’s executive orders. A large-scale healthcare development programme is also being implemented.
The future of training camps built for the 2018 FIFA World Cup was another topic raised during the meeting.
Andrei Vorobyov said that the development of the Moscow Transport Hub was also a sensitive issue. In the five years since the programme was launched, 22 overpasses have been built in the region, and a bridge over the Volga River will open in 2018 in Dubna, where a free economic zone and the world-famous Joint Institute for Nuclear Research are located.
The President discussed with the Moscow Region Governor issues related to federal motorways, including the construction and modernisation of the Shchyolkovskoye Motorway.
