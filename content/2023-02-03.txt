President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
Today we will discuss an issue which is extremely important for ensuring Russia’s internal security. Over the past decades, it has not lost its relevance for many countries, and today it is of particular importance for us. I am talking about the fight against terrorism.
We have several speakers. Please, Mr Bortnikov.
