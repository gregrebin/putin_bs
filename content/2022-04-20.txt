President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers,
My congratulations to you on the successful launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. This is a big, momentous event in the development of advanced weapons systems for the Russian Army. The new complex has the highest tactical and technical characteristics and is capable of overcoming all modern means of anti-missile defence. It has no analogues in the world and will not have any for a long time to come.
This truly unique weapon will strengthen the combat potential of our Armed Forces, reliably ensuring Russiaâ€™s security against external threats, and will be a wakeup call for those who are trying to threaten our country in the frenzy of rabid, aggressive rhetoric.
I would like to thank all those who took part in developing and producing this new complex, who made an intellectual contribution to resolving the goals set and who translated into reality the ideas of scientists and designers. Thank you very much.
I would like to emphasise that only domestic parts and components were used in creating the Sarmat missile. This will, of course, facilitate its production by defence industry enterprises and expedite its use in the Strategic Missile Forces.
I would like to thank you for your selfless efforts once again. I wish you new achievements in the name of our Motherland.
