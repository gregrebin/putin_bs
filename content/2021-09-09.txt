At the meeting of the Russian Pobeda (Victory) Organising Committee (via videoconference).
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, welcome to you all.
We will have to begin with tragic events.
As you know, Head of the Emergencies Ministry Yevgeny Zinichev passed away yesterday. The Ministry itself has been created and exists in order to help people, to save them, and Mr Zinichev had performed his duty through and through: he died trying to save the life of another person.
Apart from that, another tragedy happened yesterday, in the Moscow Region, a gas explosion that took toll of several lives and injured many others.
I ask you to hold a moment of silence in memory of all our citizens, who have left this life.
(A minute of silence.)
Thank you.
Let us get down to work.
This year is marked by a number of memorable dates that are of importance to Russia and our entire society. In particular, there is the 80th anniversary of the beginning of the Great Patriotic War and the tragic events of its first and most difficult stage.
Another date is the beginning of the siege of Leningrad on September 8, 1941, when the enemy closed the circle around the city, but it never succeeded in overpowering the courage of its defenders, the spirit of the Leningraders.
The war-related signature dates are also part of our personal, family history, which largely determines the Russian people’s reverential, sacred attitude to the heroes and the chronicle of the Great Patriotic War as well as our adamant determination to defend the honour and memory of those who fought against Nazism.
The important thing is that we pass on the truth about their feat of valour and our Great Victory, from generation to generation. We also remember the lessons of the Second World War and will never allow the vindication and whitewashing of the criminals, and their monstrous plans that threatened the whole of mankind.

Greetings to the International Research and Practice Forum, The Khabarovsk War Crime Trials: Historic Significance and Contemporary Challenges
September 6, 2021
A case in point is the recent International Scientific and Practical Forum dedicated to the 1949 Khabarovsk War Crime Trials. The forum results will be presented later in the day by Prosecutor General of Russia Igor Krasnov.
It was the Soviet investigators who collected irrefutable evidence that exposed the Japanese militarists as guilty of crimes against humanity, of preparing a bacteriological war. These heinous plans were never destined to come to fruition: In the summer of 1945, when Europe was returning to peaceful life, the Soviet forces routed the Kwantung Army and put an end to World War II.
I will repeat that we will never allow anyone to forget, not to mention, belie the unprecedented, mass heroism of our predecessors – in both the battlefields and on the home front where Victory was also forged.
It is hard to comprehend the importance of the exploits of the home front up to this day. In the flames of the outbreak of war, people evacuated vital factories and plants for thousands of kilometres inside the country and then redeployed and reoriented them in a short span of time. They mastered the production of the latest weapons, ammunition and equipment and put them on the assembly line, increasing many times over the mining of minerals and the supplies of strategic resources and raw materials.

News of the Russian Pobeda (Victory) Organising Committee
The scale of production at that time is stunning even now, in peacetime. It is impossible to imagine what human efforts it took to do all this, particularly during those most difficult war years.
We have instituted an honorary title in Russia, The City of Labour Valour, as a sign of the deepest respect and admiration for those who worked in plants and factories, hospitals and research laboratories without rest and sleep, disregarding all privations and sometimes sacrificing their lives. We have done this to reaffirm our respect for these people.
This title has already been conferred on 32 Russian cities. Today, we will review new applications from the regions for it. Head of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) Alexander Sergeyev will present the conclusions of historians and other researchers.
I would also like to note that in 2020 the United Russia party supported the initiative to award a special status to the home front cities that distinguished themselves during the war. The party is actively developing this initiative, collecting materials for its promotion and conducting nationwide voting. First Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council, Secretary of the United Russia General Council Andrei Turchak will tell us about the results of this work.
Today, the Pobeda (Victory) Organising Committee will decide which cities and towns will receive new steles with the City of Labour Valour title. I would like to suggest right away that United Russia assume an obligation, a mission – to put in order all memorials and monuments in those cities and town, linked with the exploits in the battlefields and home front, hold discussions with local residents and launch educational programmes for the younger generation so that they know how much their home city and their family did for the Great Victory.
Let us get down to work.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: Allow me to sum up the results and to name the cities that will receive the honorary title, City of Labour Valour, as per the decision of our Organising Committee. The relevant Executive Order will be signed in the near future.
So, I have the pleasure of congratulating you on conferring this honorary title on 12 Russian cities, including major industrial centres and even small towns that have played no less a role in the history of this country and in the history of the Great Victory.

Executive order on awarding City of Labour Valour title
September 10, 2021
The list includes the city of Okha in the north of Sakhalin. In 1942, its residents accomplished the seemingly impossible and laid an oil pipeline to the mainland USSR via the Tatar Strait. Okha provided the fighting Motherland with three million tonnes of “black gold.”
Stupino near Moscow can be rightfully proud of its fellow residents who manufactured over 27,000 aircraft propellers and 7,000 tonnes of aluminum sheet for the aircraft industry during the war.
Kostroma provided the Navy with 120 minesweepers and supplied countless kilometres of textiles to military units.
The city of Lysva in the Perm Territory supplied the Red Army’s frontline units with personal protective equipment. We have already discussed this here today. For example, Lysva supplied over ten million soldier’s helmets alone.
Syzran in the Volga region collected 25,000 pieces of warm clothing for soldiers and delivered them to the front. Its residents also manufactured 41 million artillery shells.
Residents of Monchegorsk located beyond the Polar Circle provided Red Army soldiers with almost 55,000 overcoats and 145,000 pairs of valenki (felt boots). They virtually gave away everything they had. The staff of a local combine expanded production of much-needed nickel three times over.
Vorkuta residents managed to boost production many times over. Ten new mines were opened here during the war, and over 6.5 million tonnes of coal were produced.
The legendary city of Aldan is also famous for its record-breaking labour exploits. Yakutia accounted for 33 percent of Soviet gold output and for 80 percent of the country’s mica production.
Work near the front called for special courage. As has already been noted here today, the enemy dropped over 3,000 bombs on Bologoye, a vital railway hub. Railway workers of the Tver Region rebuilt the damaged city and the tracks all on their own, and they tried hard to supply the army without interruption.
Chita accommodated specialists and scientists who had been evacuated from various Soviet cities. The Institute of Epidemiology, Microbiology and Hygiene was opened there in August of 1941, and production of highly important medications was launched a year later. Everything was delivered to the front.
Enterprises in Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod Region gained fame through their history-making discoveries, technologies and innovative approaches. One of them is a major company affiliated with the Russian chemical sector.
And, of course, Kemerovo, the capital of Kuzbass, expanded production many times over during the war and now ranks among the country’s industrial centres.
Virtually every family and community in this country made their contribution to the Great Victory. We will therefore, of course, expand the list of Cities of Labour Valour.
I would like to once again congratulate the residents of cities that have already received this honorary title. Friends, I would like to wish you every success and all the best.
Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko,
I am delighted to see you. I asked you to come in order to sum up what has been done recently at the expert, government level to form the development programmes for the Union State.
We have worked hard for many months and, one might even say, for many years now. I would like to point out right away that what I hope we will agree upon today is not related to the current political situation in our countries or the political calendar in the lead-up to the parliamentary elections in Russia. This is our current long-standing joint project which, as I said, has been going on for many years.
It appears that the experts have come to an agreement on a number of key areas. What we need to do now is compare notes, draw a line under certain issues and give our respective governments an opportunity to finalise some of these agreements and do so very soon. I think they are getting together in Minsk tomorrow.

This is a major effort which mostly concentrates on the economy, finance and industrial policy, which is vital, especially now that the world is facing the aftermath of the coronavirus infection, which weighed on economies around the world with global GDP down more than 3 percent and trade losing even more.
This also encourages us to step up our efforts towards improving the competitiveness of our respective economies and to do our best to make the most of the advantages provided by the Union State in order to leave behind the post-pandemic crisis and to move forward with confidence.
I am very glad to see you and I am sure we will accomplish much today.
President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you, Mr Putin.
I think we will do a good job. We probably have less to do than we did at our previous meetings. They lasted a long time – five and eight hours because at that time we were like bulldozers, clearing the way for our governments and experts. They did their part, but they kept stumbling over problems that they could not resolve or make a decision on, so we had to do some of it ourselves.
As for history, you will remember that everything started in Sochi, in Krasnaya Polyana when we had to deal with many issues. This was the demand of our nations. We were being criticised a lot for the lack of dynamics, lack of development in the Union State and at that point, and we decided to respond. We then compiled over 30 roadmaps and outlined in broad strokes what had to be done.
Working on these roadmaps later, we concluded over a year ago that we needed specific plans rather than outlines, and so we went on to our union programme.
It appears today that we are ready to discuss the final stages of 28 programmes – this is a lot, these are the main themes and areas of cooperation. You said, correctly, that we must give our governments the opportunity to review them at the expert and government levels again tomorrow. If they accept them, then we will finally adopt these programmes at the SSC, Supreme State Council [of the Union State of Russia and Belarus] – as we agreed, we will schedule the time, probably in late October.
This will be a breakthrough, probably a breakthrough in many areas – it is no secret. We will publish these programmes and show everyone the areas we are working in. But you are right, we started this over three years ago. We set our governments this goal, and I hope we have resolved it successfully.
And what matters here, of course… what do the elections have to do with this? If we did something good, let it be a gift for this big election holiday if people appreciate it. People know better because here… like all civilised countries, we are moving forward only as a union. We are homelands, close nations, practically a single whole. Our people have the same roots – Russians and Belarusians. We are doing what we must and let them judge us.
Vladimir Putin: All right. As I said, in the post-COVID period, it is particularly important to find additional resources for the efficiency of our economies.
Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, you are right.
Vladimir Putin: To make them more competitive. I think we are on the right track.
Now we will discuss all this, talk about it.

Speech by President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the BRICS summit
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Prime Minister Modi, President Xi Jinping, President Ramaphosa, President Bolsonaro,
Ladies and gentlemen,
First, I would like to join my colleagues who spoke before and thank Prime Minister Modi and all our Indian friends for the active work conducted by India as the BRICS chair this year.
Despite the special conditions related to the coronavirus pandemic, India as the chair has done everything it could to ensure the progressive development of strategic partnership of the BRICS countries without any setbacks.
I agree with my colleagues who expressed this opinion that the authority of our association is growing. Its role in international affairs is on the rise and it is substantial. This is a logical result of the BRICS ability to develop effective cooperation in the entire range of topical global and regional issues during 15 years of our joint activities.
Such close partnership of the BRICS countries is greatly in demand, considering that the global situation still remains very turbulent. The risks of the coronavirus pandemic are obvious to all of us, and my colleagues have just spoken about this. This threat has affected practically all aspects of our life, impeding the development of the global economy and exacerbating many social problems.
In addition to this, what is happening around the world remains very tense. Global security is subjected to serious trials and the system of strategic stability has noticeably deteriorated. Far from being settled, long-standing regional conflicts are flaring up with renewed force.
The withdrawal of the US and their allies from Afghanistan has led to a new crisis situation, and it remains unclear how it will affect regional and global security, so it is absolutely right that our countries pay special attention to this issue.
Understandably, just like its BRICS partners, Russia has consistently advocated the establishment of long-awaited peace and stability in Afghanistan, where the people have been fighting for many decades and have earned the right to independently determine what their state will be like.
At the same time, we are not interested in Afghanistan remaining a threat to neighbouring countries or having terrorism and illegal drug trafficking coming from the Afghan territory threaten us. We are interested in stopping the migration flow and we want the Afghans to be able to live a peaceful and dignified life in their own country.
I have mentioned many times that the current round of the crisis in Afghanistan is a direct consequence of irresponsible extraneous attempts to impose someone else’s values on the country and to build “democratic structures” using socio-political engineering techniques, ignoring the historical and national specifics of other nations and the traditions by which they live.
All of that leads to nothing but destabilisation and, ultimately, chaos, after which the masterminds behind these experiments hastily retreat leaving their charges behind. The entire international community then has to face the consequences.
I am convinced that peaceful progress in international relations can be guaranteed only through ensuring the existence of states with different political and social systems, their own national interests and spiritual and moral values, but with mandatory observance of the fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the UN Charter, including non-interference in internal affairs and respect for sovereignty.
It is likewise important to maintain and promote mutually respectful, constructive and meaningful interaction at the global level, to strengthen the emerging multipolar system which comprises independent centres of economic growth and political influence, of which BRICS is, of course, a part.
In this context, we consider very relevant the topic of our meeting and the topic of the entire year in BRICS that was chosen by our Indian partners and the Indian chairmanship which is promoting cooperation on the basis of continuity, consolidation and consensus. In fact, the entire international community is facing this challenge, and five BRICS countries are playing a significant and noticeable role in addressing it.
I hope our work today will be substantive and productive. I would like to emphasise once again that Russia stands ready to continue close interaction with the BRICS countries in all areas.
Thank you.
