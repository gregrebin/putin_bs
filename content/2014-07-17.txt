With President of Bolivia Evo Morales.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to see you.
Next year, we will be marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our nations. I am very happy to note that we have such warm relations. Now our goal is to ensure thatour trade and economic ties reflect the level of our relations.
Your nation is one of the largest producers of gas, which you deliver to Brazil and to Argentina; I know that our companies have already taken the first steps to engage in joint projects. Other Russian companies are showing interest in working in your country on the energy engineering market. This will certainly create new jobs and develop the economy.
In addition to everything else, you have a busy political calendar this year. I want to wish you success in the Presidential elections.
President of Bolivia EVO MORALES (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I want to express my pleasure at your visit to Latin America. You have stayed in our region for more than three or four days, and that is vital. Your presence in Latin America is very important for us – for the region and for Bolivia.
In particular, I want to note the gas supply agreement that you signed with China. I would also like to express satisfaction with your policy regarding the Baltic Sea. I support your actionsin various ways in sustaining sovereignty and promoting it throughout the world.
I also want to mention that, indeed, we have already started work at the Azero gas field with Gazprom. Now we expect that Rosneft will enter our market; we expect to deepen our relations with that company as well. We give particular importance to investment agreements and investment cooperation with Rosneft. Russia’s presence in our market is very important.
Our country has been developing successfully since nationalising the oil and gas sector. We are no longer a nation that is afraid of the world around us. Nationalisation has freed us economically. We welcome foreign investment in our economy in various ways.
We would like to broaden cooperation with Russian companies, transferring it to other areas, so that we are not just talking about oil and gas production, but joint projects in other areas as well, particularly the mining industry and technology transfers. We would like to know how we could use Russian loans and increase Russia’s presence in our nation in the technology sector.

Vladimir Putin: Mr President, my friend,
I am very happy to see you, and I want to note that everything we set as objectives in our relations with Hugo Chavez, and later, with you – we are carrying out all of it.
Despite the hardships in the global economy, our trade is growing; last year, it grew quite significantly. We are implementing major joint projects, working together in the social sector, in military technology cooperation, and other areas, including energy and construction.
I know that soon, you will be celebrating Hugo Chavez’s 60th birthday. If you allow, we would like to send a high-level Russian Government representative to participate in those events.
You know that we have named a street in Moscow after Hugo Chavez; you were present at that celebratory event. We are planning to issue a special postal stamp in honour of the 60th anniversary since his birth.
I am very happy to see you.
Nicolas Maduro
(retranslated): I am also very pleased to see you. You are a great friend to our people. In addition, Russia, under your leadership, is doing enormous, large-scale work to strengthen multipolarity. So the development of our cooperation is progressing rapidly. This was the dream of our late President Chavez; he believed in it.
Today’s BRICS meeting was wonderful and the statement on the creation of the bank was an enormous step. As I said today during the meeting, this is the path toward a new alliance. That is how we should continue our work, strengthening our cooperation.
I am very happy to see you.

With President of Uruguay Jose Mujica.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I was very pleased to meet you and have a brief conversation with you in Argentina; and now, we are able to continue our contacts.
I want to note right away that we view Uruguay as a promising partner in Latin America. We have various opportunities for joint projects, including infrastructure development – railroads, port infrastructure, hydroelectric energy and other areas, as well as cooperation in the military technology sector.
Jose Mujica (retranslated): Since we are talking about the economy, I would like to show you a map.
Our country is very small and dignified, but it is located at the crossroads of some very important paths, because we are at the Parana river basin.
(Showing a map.) Look, these are the largest iron ore deposits in the world. It would be logical to take it downstream in the direction of the coast. There is also a very large deposit in Bolivia. These are very large volumes.
Here is Uruguay. It is the gateway to the sea, to the ocean; large ships come here. We are currently developing a project with the Brazilians to jointly develop a major port.
We would also like to invite Russian companies to participate in this project. Moreover, this will be a world-class seaport and China will certainly participate. It is very important for China to work in our market.
In addition, it is possible that there may be large oil deposits in the Rio de la Plata area.
