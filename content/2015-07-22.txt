With Governor of Ryazan Region Oleg Kovalev.
Discussion focused, in particular, on the agribusiness sector. Mr Kovalyov
said that agricultural production is up by 6 percent on last year’s figure.
Mr Kovalyov also spoke about a number of investment projects, efforts to develop import replacement, and implemention of the President’s May 2012 executive orders.
In particular, a new pharmacological plant has been built in Ryazan Region. The plant will produce up to 40 million flu vaccine doses, enough to cover entire national demand, and will also manufacture anti-encephalitis vaccines and interferon. There will be 1,000 new jobs at the plant.
Work is also underway on renovating a machine-tool plant crucial for the defence industry. Production will resume in full at the plant over the next three years.
This autumn, BERVEL GmbH (Germany) will open a new plant in the region. Russian investors signed a contract with the German company to build a plant to manufacture high-strength bolts and calibrated rolled steel. The plant will create more than 300 jobs and use the latest technology and equipment.
Mr Kovalyov also briefed the President on implementation of a number of social sector projects.
