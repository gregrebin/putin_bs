President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Mr Dedov and I agreed quite a while ago to get together in this format. Mr Dedov proposed that we meet to discuss the issues facing the Academy of Medical Sciences, not as an institution, but as a platform for top-level medical research, where specialists in high-tech medicine test and develop new treatment methods.
I looked through the subjects proposed for discussion today. Of course, it is not easy for a non-specialist to get to the bottom of all of these issues, but I will do my best to listen carefully to what you have to say and then to formulate – with your coordination – instructions for the Government so as to have the Healthcare Ministry and other agencies react to your proposals and healthcare development plans, and react to the Academy of Medical Sciences’ proposals in order to raise the quality of medical services we offer our citizens.
