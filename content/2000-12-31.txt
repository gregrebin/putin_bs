Vladimir Putin:
Dear friends, respected citizens of Russia, during these minutes, we are not only checking our watches, we are also checking our intentions and our feelings, checking our expectations and what we have in reality. One more year is behind us. A year of joyous and tragic events, a year of difficult decisions. Nevertheless, things that once seemed quite impossible are becoming a fact of life.
Notable elements of stability have appeared in our country, and that means a great deal for politics, for the economy, and for all of us. We have realized at what cost our country's dignity comes, and how highly it is appreciated. But we all know that on this festive night, far from everyone has a bountiful table, nor is there happiness and success in every home. Let us remember that and not forget that we still have a lot of work to do. But only together can we accomplish this. And then the time will surely come when we no longer need to worry about our elderly or our children.
Dear friends, I know that all of you are already looking at your watches. In just a few seconds, we shall simultaneously enter a new year, a new century, and a new millennium. This rarely happens, but it will happen again for our descendants, whose lives are difficult for us to imagine today. It is to them that we will leave our legacy of both successes and mistakes, but during these minutes, each of us is thinking of our nearest and dearest.
I want to wish you what one usually wishes his relatives and friends: good health, peace, prosperity, and, of course, success. Happiness to you and Happy New Year!
