President Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
Allow me to wish you a warm welcome. I am very happy to see you here in Moscow.
We know that political events in your country are developing at a rapid pace, but I would like to express the hope that whatever happens in Thailand, the foundation that we have laid over these last years in our economic, inter-governmental and other ties will continue to serve the interests of our peoples in the immediate, medium and long-term future.
I would like to thank you for accepting this invitation. Today we have the opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations and the situation in the region in general.
Thaksin Shinawat: Thank you, Mr President, for giving me this opportunity to meet with you. Thank you very much for the warm reception you have given me.
I would like to express my gratitude and admiration for the way in which you have successfully facilitated your country’s economic and political development over these last years.
Although this visit and my last visit were both very brief, I can see a lot of change taking place in Moscow. It is noticeable how much construction is underway in the city and this indicates that the economy of Moscow and its surrounding region is developing fast.
I hope that the relations that you and I have established will contribute to the development of economic ties between our countries. I hope that once the political situation in Thailand is settled, we will be able pursue to a firm course towards carrying out all our plans for developing the economic relations between Russia and Thailand.
Why have I come here today? First of all, because I wanted to explain to you the situation in Thailand. I also wanted to assure you that that Thailand’s commitment to democracy remains unchanged. We will do all we can to defend democratic freedom in Thailand. Moreover, our foreign policy also remains unchanged.
