With Formula 1 President Bernie Ecclestone.
Vladimir Putin: It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Sochi.
We have long been working on the Formula 1 project here in Sochi, and it is nearing completion now. I know there were quite a few difficulties in the course of its implementation, but these were all working matters that are being resolved.
I am pleased that the Formula 1 project in Sochi will be a good supplement to what has been done to prepare for the Olympic and Paralympic Games and will be another opportunity to use the facilities after all the major competitions are over.
We are very happy to see you.
Bernie Ecclestone: Great many people were involved in the project. I am very proud of how it is being implemented and would like to thank everyone for their support, especially the President.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
When do we plan to launch Formula 1?
Bernie Ecclestone: In October.
