Vladimir Putin: Mr Secretary General, welcome!
You have just arrived. I hope your trip was not tiring.
We are glad that we are able to meet you regularly. You know our attitude to the United Nations. We highly value the achievements made by the organisation which we think is a key to maintaining international peace.
We hope that our joint efforts would help to increase the UN’s role. You know that we adhere to the principles the organisation is based on.
Unfortunately, we cannot always settle local conflicts by ourselves, and the positive role of the UN in their peaceful settlement cannot be exaggerated. Russia is taking part in 11 of 15 peacekeeping operations conducted by the UN.
We think it is necessary to once again point out that it is very important to use force only in accordance with the UN’s schemes.
I want to say that you personally are working hard to maintain the leading role of the UN’s unique work. In recent years, much has been done with your direct involvement. We hope for your further positive cooperation. We have many important problems to solve. These are the situations in the Middle East, the Balkans and some other regions. We would like to exchange views on these and other issues.
