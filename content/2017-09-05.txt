Beginning of the meeting with Prime Minister of Thailand Prayuth Chan-o-cha
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
Please accept my warmest greetings. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the BRICS summit.
This year, we mark the 120th anniversary of diplomatic relations: exactly 120 years ago, during his royal visit to St Petersburg, King Rama V agreed to establish diplomatic relations between Russia and Thailand.
In all these years, Russian-Thai relations have never been overshadowed by any negative events. Today, our relations are largely based on economic ties of course, and here we have good prospects.
While last year we observed a decline, there was significant growth in the first half of 2017. There is also a growing interest in Thai culture here in Russia, and the number of Russian tourists in Thailand is increasing.
Mr Prime Minister, I am very happy that we have a very good relationship, and we meet on a regular basis.
Prayut Chan-o-Cha (retranslated) : Thank you for coming. Today, I am pleased to meet with you again following our meeting in Sochi last year. Our relationship is a priority every year.
I know you are very busy. I welcome Russia’s influence on the international market. Again, I would like to invite you to Thailand, maybe next year, after the presidential elections.
As we pointed out, we need to achieve the goal of increasing our trade to $10 billion in 2020. I know that Russia imported more rubber and rice this year than last year, but the volume of trade is still low. I would like to see Russia [as a country] importing more such goods.
Please expedite [the work] of interested agencies (ministries) to send specialists to Thailand to look into Thai manufacturers.

Speech at the meeting of BRICS leaders with delegation heads from invited states
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chairperson, colleagues,
I would like to begin, just as the other heads of BRICS states did, by greeting the heads of state and government from Egypt, Guinea, Tajikistan, Thailand and Mexico, who are attending our meeting today.
It has become a good tradition to hold outreach meetings on the sidelines of BRICS summits. They help our countries develop cooperation with various agencies and regional organisations.
During our previous summits, we had fruitful meetings with leaders from the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union
, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.
This year we invited leaders from several emerging market countries to the Xiamen summit. These countries are our natural allies and promising business partners, therefore it is logical that BRICS is developing close socioeconomic cooperation with them and has expressed readiness to allign our positions on the international stage.
Colleagues, Russia has been working actively to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as it has been said today.

At a meeting of BRICS leaders with delegation heads from invited states.
We cooperate with international organisations within the UN network to jointly implement projects that are aimed, in particular, at attaining food security, modernising the industrial and transport infrastructure and resolving environmental issues.
Thus, in 2016, Russia allocated $1.16 billion towards the Sustainable Development Goals. We have written off over $20 billion of African countries’ debts through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
Russia provides support to the World Food Programme and is the fifth largest contributor to the UNIDO Industrial Development Fund.
I would like to point out that Russia’s position of principle is that assistance to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals must not be conditioned by any political requirements or terms, as this would have a negative impact on the efforts to achieve the main goals, namely eradicate poverty and serious imbalances in the development of regions and states, as well as provide debt relief to the developing countries.
Development goals are directly linked to one more serious international issue, namely, global climate change. I would like to remind you that Russia has implemented all of its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. Between 1991 and 2012, we have not just prevented the growth of greenhouse emissions but have reduced them by 40 billion tonnes.
We have been working consistently to prepare the ratification of the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. Russia’s extensive contribution will largely compensate for the growth of emissions in other countries and regions.
I would like to add that Russia has started drafting a long-term low-emission development strategy and plan on climate change mitigation, as per the Paris Agreement.
Colleagues, in conclusion I would like to express confidence that our meeting today will promote a better understanding and respect for the interests of each other and will help boost our multifaceted cooperation and dialogue between our nations.
Thank you for your attention.
