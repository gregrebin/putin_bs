Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting in narrow format.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Colleagues, friends,
I am happy to see you in Astana today, where you have come to discuss important issues concerning further development of the Eurasian Economic Union.
I would like to begin by congratulating all of you on an important date, the second anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Eurasian Economic Union, which took place in Astana on May 29, 2014. The Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Belarus launched this project. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan joined the union later, and now the EAEU is picking up its pace.
We have gathered here today to discuss and adopt decisions on important current issues pertaining to EAEU’s operations. Our agenda includes 14 items. Some of them are to be discussed in a narrow format here and now.
