The annual forum which has been held since 2013 brings together experts from major Russian companies and higher education institutions, the best national educators and well-motivated school students in order to address topical matters in the area of career guidance and self-determination. The open lesson involves teams of school students and teachers who won a competition for the best career guidance practices.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Yana [Yana Churikova, Co-Chair of the Russian Movement of School Students], good afternoon everyone! I am very happy to see you all here.
Unfortunately, I was unable to visit Yaroslavl this year, but I would like to sincerely greet those who gathered in this wonderful ancient Russian city.
I would like to say that this is a highly important annual event. I want to note that, indeed, year after year, ProyeKTOriya and other similar programmes effectively help young people to choose the most attractive careers that they like and find their place in life, without making any mistakes. This is extremely crucial for all of you and for the entire country…
As you well know, we are standing on the threshold of serious changes. Russia and the entire world are standing on the threshold of drastic changes linked with state-of-the-art technologies which are changing the world at a breath-taking pace and right before our very own eyes.
And, of course, it is of great importance that young people should choose fields where they can prove their worth, where they can score top results and unlock their potential for the benefit of their families, their friends and the entire country.
This year alone, 250,000 young people enrolled at major national enterprises and companies dealing with innovations, including new materials, medicine, unmanned transport systems, artificial intelligence and biology in the broadest sense of the word, including genetic research.
All this is so important that it will determine the future of this country – not just your own future but also that of your children and grandchildren. All this is so popular today that, of course, I would like to thank your parents and instructors.
Yana, I would like to thank you for devoting so much attention to this work.
Thank you very much, and I wish you every success.
