Knyaz Vladimir is the lead ship of the renewed Borei-A class submarines with improved nuclear-missile weapons: each submarine will carry 20 Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Sevmash is the only shipyard in Russia that constructs nuclear-powered submarines. Over the course of its history, the plant has produced 128 submarines for the Russian Navy.

Speech at laying-down ceremony for Knyaz Vladimir nuclear-powered submarine.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, friends,
Yesterday, everyone who was or is involved in the Navy marked its professional holiday, Navy Day. And today, on the first working day after the holiday, we are holding a very important, festive event: we are laying down a new nuclear-powered submarine Knyaz Vladimir, named in honour of the Russian prince who gathered the Slavic tribes into one united state and who was one of the founders of the modern centralised Russian state.
By 2020, we should have eight Borei-class submarines. Two of them will be the Alexander Nevsky, which has almost concluded factory trials, and another vessel that is completing such trials now. And today, we are laying down the third one.
I am certain that the entire project will be implemented and the new Knyaz Vladimir nuclear-powered submarine, as well as its sister-vessels, other ships of this class, will be among the symbols of Russia’s Armed Forces.
Here at Sevmash, a great deal has been done to strengthen Russia’s defence capabilities. All together, you have built 129 submarines. This is a unique record. I do not know if there is any other company in the world that has done as much for its country as Sevmash.
The personnel here are highly skilled and efficient. Large teams are working on similar submarines: scientists, engineers and skilled workers. Through your work, you have proven that you can solve the most ambitious challenges. I am certain that you will handle this one as well.
I wish you success and I hope that this future nuclear submarine will serve Russia well. Thank you.
