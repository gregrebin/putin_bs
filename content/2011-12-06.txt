Excerpts from transcript of meeting with Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Vladimir Churov
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: As far as the outcomes of the State Duma elections are concerned, I will be meeting with the heads of all our parties, both parliamentary and non-parliamentary. I think that they will also have some suggestions on improving our legislation. Naturally, we will discuss all this, because our democracy is still developing and is not ideal â€“ this is something I have said many times. And after every election, we have always made adjustments to election legislation. Naturally, certain proposals are more drastic. Yesterday, I once again received the suggestion of returning to the mixed system for electing deputies to the State Duma, i.e., via party lists and majority constituencies. But that is a topic for a separate discussion. I think that we should discuss it in order to have the full palette on the table, so to speak. We will certainly meet to discuss this issue later.
