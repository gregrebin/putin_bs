Beginning of meeting with Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borissov
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleague, friends,
I would like to welcome you in Moscow. I am happy that after a fairly long interval you accepted our invitation to come to Russia.
Just recently I had the pleasure of receiving the Bulgarian President in Russia. I hope your visit to Russia, our meeting today and the talks, and your negotiations with the Russian Government will create good conditions for the further development of our relations in various areas, including the economy, as well as political, cultural and humanitarian contacts.
We have recently celebrated the 140th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation from the Ottoman yoke and the Day of Slavic Writing and Culture – everything that makes us kindred spirits and closely unites us.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borissov
(retranslated): Mr President,
I am very grateful to you for this opportunity to come after so many years and meet with you in the Kremlin. Indeed, we first met in Gdansk, then in Sofia and meet for a third time here.
I am grateful to you for the opportunity to exchange ideas by telephone during this entire period. I believe we could share our views on topics where there is some movement, and on the situation in the world and the Western Balkans.
Russia has always had influence in this region. You know what projects are carried out there. We are implementing certain projects on developing infrastructure in this region: roads, railways and gas infrastructure.
We are cooperating well with your special services on counterterrorism and security matters. We could be much more active in tourism and agriculture. We could discuss all of these aspects of our relations.
I would also like to mention that in 10 to 15 days Moscow will host the FIFA World Cup and become the football capital.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
