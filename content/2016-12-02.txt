Meeting with Foreign Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
I am very pleased about the continuation of our contacts. At the APEC meeting in Lima, we agreed with the Prime Minister that such a meeting may take place.
It is very good that our contacts are not interrupted. We are working on implementing the proposals of the Prime Minster on expanding our contacts in all areas of interest for us on both sides.
I am very glad to see you.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan Fumio Kishida (retranslated): Mr President, I would like to thank you for finding the time to meet me.
This is my first visit to St Petersburg. Today I did a bit of sightseeing before the meeting, and I am captivated by the beauty of this city. It is a great honour for me to meet with you in your hometown, St Petersburg.
This is my first visit to Russia since September of last year. This time I came to Russia to conduct final preparations for your visit to Japan with the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Lavrov, in order to achieve results on a broad range of political and economic issues, including the signing of a peace treaty, during your visit.
We paid a great deal of attention to your words in yesterday’s annual Address to the Federal Assembly that you hope for tangible progress in relations with Japan, and we appreciate you mentioning this in your Address.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
Our minister, as they say in Russia, immediately took the bull by the horns. I do not know who the bull here is. Nevertheless, he took initiative and I did not even get a chance to welcome you. So, first of all, I would like to say good evening, welcome to Russia, to St Petersburg, to the Mariinsky Theatre.
I am greatly pleased with the fact that every year, our friends meet here, who not simply like Russian art, not simply like Russian culture, but feel almost the same way we do. We are on the same wavelength in our worldview, each with a considerable share of [national] identity but nevertheless, there is something that we share.
I should say that this is the third year in a row that we have been holding national events – the first year, the second and the third – that are in some way or other related to Russian culture. Last year, we had the Year of Literature. This year is the Year of the Cinema. The year before last was in fact the Year of Culture.
I am pleased to note that although we rightly take pride in Russian cultural achievements, we always say that they are part of world culture and there is absolutely no doubt about that. Every one of you can certainly be proud of what our peoples have accomplished over the centuries – starting from Greece and Italy and all other countries in the world, including China, with its centuries-old, millennium-old culture. So I am greatly pleased to note – I would like to stress once again that Russian culture is part of world culture.
I would like to thank you for being here today, for giving so much attention to our cooperation in such an important sphere as cultural cooperation, which, indeed, both in the direct and figurative sense of the word, knows no bounds.
A lot has been said here about our ties. This is a spiritual bond, I agree. Our friends from France cited the example of a young man who went to France and then his son came to Russia. His father left responding to the call of passion while his son came to make his first billion. This is in fact the impact of Western culture on Russia. I’m joking, of course. Anyway, I wish your film good luck.
I would like to wish you luck in all of your undertakings. Many thanks to our friend from Italy for his wonderful gift. Believe me, we do appreciate such gestures. Thank you very much.
I hope you will enjoy your time in St Petersburg and the Mariinsky Theatre.
Thank you very much.

Opening of the central section of the Western High-Speed Diameter
Vladimir Putin attended the opening ceremony of the central section of the Western High-Speed Diameter toll road in St Petersburg.

St Petersburg
The Western High-Speed Diameter is a 46.6-kilometre road with a total length, including all exit and entry ramps and interchanges, of over 70 kilometres. It features 15 interchanges, and its width varies from four to eight lanes. The new road is expected to ease congestion in the historic centre of St Petersburg, the St Petersburg Ring Road and road network, enabling drivers to cross the city in less than 20 minutes.
The section of the Western High-Speed Diameter that was launched today links the southern and northern parts of the St Petersburg Ring Road, and provides a connection with the Scandinavia motorway. The northern and southern parts of the road are already in operation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I want to thank all of your teams, builders, engineers, and all those who participated in the construction effort. This is a big event not only for St Petersburg, but the entire northwest as well. I think you are well aware of it, because this expressway will connect the city’s business centres, and a huge number of vehicles will be able to bypass the historic centre.
Currently, the existing sections are used by 3 million vehicles a month. We just heard that after the central section opens to traffic, this number will increase to 6–7 million a month. Can you imagine the enormous number of vehicles which will go around the city centre? This will help preserve the historic centre, and will certainly improve the environmental situation and air quality.
Among other things, the economic component is very significant, because the expressway will help promote commercial activity in these city districts. Again, this is the largest public-private partnership project. It cost 210 billion rubles. Construction began in 2005 and is now complete. This is an important milestone for St Petersburg.
Thank you very much. Please accept my congratulations on this accomplishment. A big thank you goes to all the participants, including our friends from foreign companies. I hope you enjoyed working here, and we will think about doing more such projects in the future. Thank you.
Remark: We are proud to work here, with you, and for you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I hope you enjoyed it. This is a beautiful, ambitious and modern project. It involved many specialists, including our major research centres and enterprises, which supplied all that was needed.
Remark: We hope we will have another chance after Pulkovo.
Vladimir Putin: Of course, you just need to talk with the people who are in charge of such projects. Perhaps you are aware of the plans that are being implemented here in the northwest, and our future plans. So, we will talk about them by all means, and continue to work.
Thank you very much. Good luck.
