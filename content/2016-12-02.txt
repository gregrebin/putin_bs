Meeting with Foreign Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
I am very pleased about the continuation of our contacts. At the APEC meeting in Lima, we agreed with the Prime Minister that such a meeting may take place.
It is very good that our contacts are not interrupted. We are working on implementing the proposals of the Prime Minster on expanding our contacts in all areas of interest for us on both sides.
I am very glad to see you.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan Fumio Kishida (retranslated): Mr President, I would like to thank you for finding the time to meet me.
This is my first visit to St Petersburg. Today I did a bit of sightseeing before the meeting, and I am captivated by the beauty of this city. It is a great honour for me to meet with you in your hometown, St Petersburg.
This is my first visit to Russia since September of last year. This time I came to Russia to conduct final preparations for your visit to Japan with the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Lavrov, in order to achieve results on a broad range of political and economic issues, including the signing of a peace treaty, during your visit.
We paid a great deal of attention to your words in yesterday’s annual Address to the Federal Assembly that you hope for tangible progress in relations with Japan, and we appreciate you mentioning this in your Address.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
Our minister, as they say in Russia, immediately took the bull by the horns. I do not know who the bull here is. Nevertheless, he took initiative and I did not even get a chance to welcome you. So, first of all, I would like to say good evening, welcome to Russia, to St Petersburg, to the Mariinsky Theatre.
I am greatly pleased with the fact that every year, our friends meet here, who not simply like Russian art, not simply like Russian culture, but feel almost the same way we do. We are on the same wavelength in our worldview, each with a considerable share of [national] identity but nevertheless, there is something that we share.
I should say that this is the third year in a row that we have been holding national events – the first year, the second and the third – that are in some way or other related to Russian culture. Last year, we had the Year of Literature. This year is the Year of the Cinema. The year before last was in fact the Year of Culture.
I am pleased to note that although we rightly take pride in Russian cultural achievements, we always say that they are part of world culture and there is absolutely no doubt about that. Every one of you can certainly be proud of what our peoples have accomplished over the centuries – starting from Greece and Italy and all other countries in the world, including China, with its centuries-old, millennium-old culture. So I am greatly pleased to note – I would like to stress once again that Russian culture is part of world culture.
I would like to thank you for being here today, for giving so much attention to our cooperation in such an important sphere as cultural cooperation, which, indeed, both in the direct and figurative sense of the word, knows no bounds.
A lot has been said here about our ties. This is a spiritual bond, I agree. Our friends from France cited the example of a young man who went to France and then his son came to Russia. His father left responding to the call of passion while his son came to make his first billion. This is in fact the impact of Western culture on Russia. I’m joking, of course. Anyway, I wish your film good luck.
I would like to wish you luck in all of your undertakings. Many thanks to our friend from Italy for his wonderful gift. Believe me, we do appreciate such gestures. Thank you very much.
I hope you will enjoy your time in St Petersburg and the Mariinsky Theatre.
Thank you very much.
