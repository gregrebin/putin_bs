With President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sargsyan, friends,
 Let me welcome you to St Petersburg.
We have just had quite a substantive face-to-face discussion of several issues. I would like to begin this meeting in a broader format by saying that despite the difficulties the global economy and our own country face today, our bilateral trade continues to grow.
 We have seen several-fold growth in the amount of agricultural produce that Armenia exports to Russia. I hope this trend will continue for our overall trade, including the more sensitive sectors.
Our relations have been developing more intensively within the integration framework we are both part of than they did when we pursued them on a bilateral basis alone, and this is good to see.
 We now have the chance to discuss our future plans. Armenia currently heads the CSTO and this organisation will hold its summit in autumn. When do you plan to hold this event?
President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan
: In October.
Vladimir Putin: In October. Then we shall discuss this too.
It is a great pleasure to see you. Thank you for accepting our invitation.
Serzh Sargsyan: Mr Putin, thank you for this initiative to hold a meeting here in St Petersburg, where only yesterday we saw the conclusion of the economic forum that has become an important platform for discussing global economic issues. I am sure that all of the Eurasian Economic Union countries followed this event closely.
With Nagorno-Karabakh being in the focus of this meeting, I will not go through the bilateral agenda right now. It is enough to say that our ties are growing stronger in all areas and there are no problems here.
As for our position on Nagorno-Karabakh, it is well known. We seek to resolve this issue exclusively through peaceful means and I want to thank you and the other leaders of the Minsk Group’s co-chair countries for the attention and effort you have been putting into this work.
Unfortunately, though, the desire of one party alone is never enough to settle a conflict. We would be happy, of course, if we could start making progress now towards implementing the agreements reached in Vienna, in other words, setting up a mechanism for investigating breaches of the ceasefire. This would create the necessary working atmosphere for the negotiations.
Thank you very much, and thank you to St Petersburg for the excellent weather.
Vladimir Putin: We will now discuss all of the issues you have raised.

With President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Aliyev, friends,
Let me welcome you in St Petersburg.
The issue we will discuss today is well known, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, a problem we inherited from earlier days. However, I would like to first take this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations.
With the St Petersburg International Economic Forum having just ended, I would like to note that, unfortunately, our bilateral trade dropped somewhat last year and this year, and this is for a variety of reasons we all know, the drop in energy prices being one. We are all aware of these factors.
I would like to make use of this meeting today to discuss this and the many other areas that make up our bilateral ties, including humanitarian matters.
We know the attention that Azerbaijan gives to the study of the Russian language, and we know how successful the branches of our universities in Azerbaijan have been. We value this greatly and we hope to continue working in this way in all the different areas.
It is a great pleasure to see you. Welcome!
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
Let me start by thanking you for this invitation to visit Russia once again. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on the success of the latest St Petersburg International Economic Forum. This year’s forum was an anniversary event. Over these years, the forum has become one of the major platforms for discussing and resolving global economic and political issues.
Azerbaijan took an active part in the forum’s work and it was particularly pleasing that you attended the signing of an agreement on building a large energy facility in Azerbaijan, a project that will be partially financed by a Russian bank.
The subject of our meeting today is, of course, settling the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I would like to thank you for the initiating this meeting and for the constructive role that Russia plays in the settlement process.
This has become a long-running conflict, and as Russia and the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs have said, the status quo is unacceptable. However, to change the status quo, we first need to end the occupation of Azerbaijani territory that has been occupied for more than 20 years now.
We will discuss this matter in detail today and we hope that it will indeed be possible to give constructive impetus to the negotiating process, which has come to a virtual standstill over the past two years. Of course, this is also a good opportunity to discuss our economic ties and our relations in other areas too.
I think that the drop in our bilateral trade is only temporary. We will look for ways to restore and develop this trade, and I think that this will happen. We also cooperate actively in the energy sector and we have good potential for transport cooperation.
The humanitarian dimension of our ties has always been particularly important and is something that creates the closeness between our peoples essential for building good relations. I would characterise relations between Russia and Azerbaijan as a strategic partnership.
Once again, I thank you for this invitation and I hope to see you very soon in Azerbaijan.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
