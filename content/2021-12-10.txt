President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
Today, I suggest discussing issues related to our economic security and ways of meeting Russia’s economic interests in the context of the current international environmental agenda.
I have asked First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov to speak about this and tell us about his ideas on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation. So, I am giving him the floor. Sergei Lavrov will be the next to speak.
