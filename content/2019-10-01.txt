With Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.
Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan: Mr President, I am happy to welcome you to Armenia and to have this opportunity to discuss bilateral issues with you.
Important events have taken place in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) today: we signed an agreement with Singapore and a transitional free trade agreement with Iran is coming into force. To be honest, I am very happy that all this is taking place in Yerevan. This is a milestone for Armenia’s Presidency of the EAEU, and I am satisfied with this. Of course, we have some time left. I hope we will manage to produce more results in the EAEU.
Naturally, our bilateral relations are very important for us. Russia is our strategic partner and we hope to make this strategic partnership increasingly stronger.
Thank you for your willingness and your attitude towards our relations. I am sure these relations will continue to grow stronger. At any rate, we are motivated to make this happen.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
For my part, I would like to reaffirm the strategic nature of our relations. We are linked not only by the events of the past few years or decades but by a centuries-long history of ties.
I would like to congratulate you as the President of the EAEU on the results of the summit in Yerevan. These are very positive results as regards the development of our ties with third countries. You have just said this. What is no less and probably even more important for us is that there was not a single setback. On the contrary, all agreements between EAEU members have been reached. You have done everything you could for this productive work. Therefore, I would like to congratulate you and thank you for this. Thank you.

With President of Iran Hassan Rouhani.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
You and I meet and work together on a regular basis. However, considering the dynamic of the situation in the region and our bilateral ties, we always know what to talk about, what to discuss.
I am glad to have this opportunity to resume our recent discussion. We will also discuss bilateral issues, the JCPOA and the situation in the region, including in the Syrian Arab Republic – this time here, in Yerevan.
I am pleased to say that we are working together on Iran’s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union. I am confident that this work will benefit our countries. It is based on the fundamental principles of international law and the basic provisions of the World Trade Organisation.
I am happy to see you.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani (retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much. I am also happy to have this opportunity to meet with you again.
Luckily, our bilateral relations are making headway, and even if we meet every week, we will still have things to discuss.
I would like to note that during the 500 years of our relations we have reached unprecedented sincerity.
Even though we met in Ankara, not long ago, we still have many things to talk about both in international and bilateral relations.
Both of our countries are located in a sensitive region and, regrettably, we have seen certain negative factors at work in the past few weeks. No matter where we cooperate our goal is peace, stability and security.
Thank you very much.
