President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I have invited you to talk about economic and financial matters.
Mr Mishustin and I have discussed this topic ahead of this meeting, having in view, of course, also the sanctions that the so-called Western community – the “empire of lies” as I have referred to it in my remarks – is trying to implement against our country.
Let us begin. The floor is yours, Mr Mishustin.
