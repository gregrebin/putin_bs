Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank Mr President for the invitation to visit Algeria. It is very pleasant for me and for all of my colleagues to be in a country with which we have a history of many fruitful years of teamwork.
Algeria was the first Arab country with which new Russia signed a strategic partnership agreement. However, similar good relations had developed between Algeria and Russia already a long time ago, many decades ago.
Today we once again confirmed the high-level status of both our political and economic relations. It was very useful for me to listen to the President's opinion both on regional and international problems. We talked a great deal about economic cooperation. We agreed to expand our cooperation in the fields of engineering, energy, infrastructure and transport. We agreed on how to settle our credit relations and financial problems. We mapped out very promising forms and directions that our cooperation will take. Many of our companies are ready to work in the Algerian market. Many of them are already present here and intend to expand their presence, their participation in the market and their work.
I wish to thank Mr President not only for the very frank and warm conversation but also for the support he provides Russian business in the Algerian market.
Many thanks to the Algerian people for all their warm feelings towards Russia.
