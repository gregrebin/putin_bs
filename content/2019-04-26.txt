President of Russia Vladimir Putin: My dear friend, President Xi Jinping,
Thank you very much for the invitation to take part in the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. I must say right at the start that your initiative is making progress. It was timed to perfection and very successful. It is assuming a global nature and beginning to dictate the principles of building international relations and the norms of economic relations that are highly relevant in the world today.
This is an extremely important initiative, which is why it enjoys so much support around the world. The large number of participants who came to Beijing to take part in the discussion is direct evidence of this.
Russian-Chinese comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation are growing on all tracks. Our cooperation has reached an unprecedented high level, serving as an example of how inter-state relations should be built in the modern world.
In 2018, mutual trade increased by 24.5 percent to a record $108 billion. Last year, we set a target of $100 billion, that is, the development pace is very high.
You have already said that this year marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. Mr President, we are looking forward to your state visit to Russia, which will become a key political event of the year in bilateral relations.
I am very pleased to have this opportunity today to meet with you, with our Chinese colleagues and friends and discuss bilateral matters and aspects of international relations that are of mutual interest to us.
Russia is determined, as it always has been over the past decades, to expand the strategic partnership with China in all areas.
