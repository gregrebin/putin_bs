President of Russia Vladimir Putin: My dear friend, President Xi Jinping,
Thank you very much for the invitation to take part in the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. I must say right at the start that your initiative is making progress. It was timed to perfection and very successful. It is assuming a global nature and beginning to dictate the principles of building international relations and the norms of economic relations that are highly relevant in the world today.
This is an extremely important initiative, which is why it enjoys so much support around the world. The large number of participants who came to Beijing to take part in the discussion is direct evidence of this.
Russian-Chinese comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation are growing on all tracks. Our cooperation has reached an unprecedented high level, serving as an example of how inter-state relations should be built in the modern world.
In 2018, mutual trade increased by 24.5 percent to a record $108 billion. Last year, we set a target of $100 billion, that is, the development pace is very high.
You have already said that this year marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. Mr President, we are looking forward to your state visit to Russia, which will become a key political event of the year in bilateral relations.
I am very pleased to have this opportunity today to meet with you, with our Chinese colleagues and friends and discuss bilateral matters and aspects of international relations that are of mutual interest to us.
Russia is determined, as it always has been over the past decades, to expand the strategic partnership with China in all areas.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam State Counsellor, colleagues. I am very pleased to see you, and I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss things at the Beijing summit.
Myanmar is Russia’s long-time and reliable partner in Southeast Asia. Last year, we marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. We are committed to the further development of political dialogue and the continuation of inter-parliamentary exchanges. Our ministries of foreign affairs also have well-established contacts.
Although quite modest in absolute terms, our mutual trade is growing rapidly, having gained more than 50 percent last year.
There are regional issues, of course, which need to be focused on.
I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you and talk about all these issues.
State Counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi: We are also very glad to have this opportunity to meet. We tried to meet with you in Singapore, but it was not possible before. Of course, we have been friends with Russia for a long time, and we value this friendship and we also appreciate the support that you have given us on the international arena. Your ambassador has done very much to promote friendship between our two countries, I think primarily because of his fluent Myanmar language, which has impressed our people a lot and made him very popular. And we look forward to expanding our relations with Russia.

With President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues. I am happy to meet with you again.
Russia-Cyprus relations are traditionally friendly and are based on the principles of respect and consideration for one another’s interests. We have a comprehensive political dialogue. We constantly maintain contacts.
Our economic ties are also developing. Mutual trade in 2018 grew by almost 154 percent despite some external difficulties. An intergovernmental commission has been working as well.
We need to pay even more attention to direct contacts between business communities. And, of course, I would like to note the very large investment flows.
We understand that to a large extent this is repatriation of Russian capital from Cyprus, but still the $148 billion that came to the Russian economy from Cyprus is a significant sum.
Russia has $166 billion of direct investment in Cyprus. I do not know what other countries contribute so much to Cyprus. In any case, I reiterate, our relations are developing quite positively. We are pleased by that and I am glad to see you again, Mr President.
President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades (retranslated): Mr President, I am also very happy to meet with you.
Our relations are indeed developing positively. Both the relations and the contacts between our countries are developing. For many years, Russia has been a close partner and friend of Cyprus both at the political and economic levels.
This is also related to investment and the loan that you gave us during a difficult time for Cyprus. We appreciate the weapons systems that you provided to us, for defence purposes, of course.
We also appreciate the position Russia takes on the Cyprus issue. We know that you have wonderful relations with Turkey. We are concerned about this and hope that you can influence your partner in order to solve the Cyprus problem as soon as possible.
I would like to assure you again that on matters of principal, we remain loyal friends of Russia. This also concerns our position within the EEC and other international organisations. We share very close and sincere cooperation.

Beijing
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, colleagues, I am very pleased to see you.
Last year we marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between our countries. We are developing our relations today, too, and very actively. And, without doubt, Egypt is Russia’s reliable partner in general and in the Middle East in particular.
The Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Strategic Cooperation, which we signed during your visit to Russia in October 2018, makes it possible to bring our relations to a new level.
We also coordinate our efforts on the global stage. I would like to thank you for agreeing to co-chair together with us the first Russia-Africa summit, which will be held this October.
Trade is also increasing. Last year it grew by 14 percent to reach almost $8 billion, and added another 25 percent in January and February.
I am very glad to have this opportunity to meet with you, Mr President.
President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
It is true that our relations are of a strategic nature. They are also historic and we strive to develop them.
As you have said, the Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Strategic Cooperation, which we signed last October, really helps to promote such cooperation. We also reaffirm our intention to develop relations in all spheres.
Mr President, I hope the upcoming Russia-Africa summit will be successful and fulfil all the tasks it addresses. Thank you very much for the opportunity to co-chair this large summit together with you.

Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation
Vladimir Putin attended the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation

Vladimir Putin spoke at the opening ceremony of the forum business program.
The Belt and Road Forum takes place in Beijing on April 25–27.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, Ladies and gentlemen,
First of all, I would like to thank my good friend President of China Xi Jinping for inviting me to attend the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.
I would like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to be here in such a large representative group and to meet with each other, to discuss current issues of global development and principles of cooperation.
I have listened with great interest – as I am sure many other people in this hall have – about the principles and goals of China’s development, that is, how the People’s Republic of China, the world’s largest economy today in terms of purchasing power parity, is planning to develop and build relationships with its partners.
This is of fundamental importance both for Russia and, I am sure, for many of our colleagues who have gathered here in Beijing today.
It is obvious that the implementation of this ambitious project, Belt and Road, promoted by our Chinese colleagues, is aimed at strengthening the constructive cooperation of the Eurasian states.
Its truly unifying goal is to ensure harmonious and sustainable economic development and economic growth throughout the Eurasian space.

At the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF).
Russia has emphasised on numerous occasions that PRC President’s Belt and Road initiative rimes with Russia’s idea to establish a Greater Eurasian Partnership, a project designed to ‘integrate integration frameworks’, and therefore to promote a closer alignment of various bilateral and multilateral integration processes that are currently underway in Eurasia.
Russia is ready to undertake efforts for creating a transparent and enabling environment in order to promote cooperation across Eurasia.
It is important that we come up with effective ways of responding to the risks of a fragmented global political, economic and technological landscape and growing protectionism, with illegitimate unilateral restrictions imposed bypassing the UN Security Council or, even worse, trade wars as its most dangerous expressions.
It is our firm belief that only by working together can we counter urgent challenges such as decelerating economic growth, the deepening prosperity gap among nations as well as technological backwardness.
Let me repeat what I have said on numerous occasions: these negative trends feed terrorism, extremism and illegal migration flows, causing old regional conflicts to resurface and new ones to emerge.
I strongly believe that Eurasia can become a role model in devising a meaningful and positive agenda for overcoming these and other urgent international problems.
Peoples of various cultures, religions and traditions have inhabited the vast Eurasian space for millennia.
Of course, there were wars and conflicts throughout the continent’s history, but sooner or later they subsided, while common sense and the natural aspiration of the people to peace and communication always triumphed at the end of the day.
Russia is interested in the closest cooperation with all Eurasian partners on the basis of unshakable principles of respect for the sovereignty, rights and legitimate interests of each state. It is on these principles that we are building the Eurasian Economic Union, with our partners – Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.
Soon, on May 29, the EAEU will have been in existence for five years. Over this period, a common market has been created, and conditions are being created to ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour. Common markets have been formed, as well as a common digital space.
In his remarks just now, President Xi Jinping spoke about linking his initiatives with similar ones and with other associations that are forming in our vast space. This absolutely fits into our plans.
The EAEU states are actively working to strengthen industrial and technological cooperation, to build efficient transport and logistics chains.
And we, too, together with our Chinese friends, with all our partners, will talk more during our meetings today and tomorrow, we will continue coordinating this work, work of a global nature.
We also continue pursuing the policy of harmonising our monetary and fiscal policies.
At the same time, the Eurasian Economic Union strives for the widest possible cooperation with all interested countries and associations.
I am primarily referring to the People’s Republic of China, the country we consider to be our key supporter, our natural partner in the integrated development of the continent.
The five EAEU member states have unanimously supported the idea of pairing the EAEU development and the Chinese Silk Road Economic Belt project. The agreements reached in this regard are being successfully implemented. In the coming months, the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation between the EAEU and China will enter into force.
The Eurasian Union is committed to liberalising economic ties with its other partners as well, and has already signed a free trade agreement with Vietnam and a provisional agreement with Iran paving the way to the creation of a free trade area. The preparation of similar instruments with Singapore and Serbia is nearing completion, and talks are underway with Israel, Egypt and India.
We cooperate actively with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
We undoubtedly stand for expanding business ties with the European Union, our long-standing and traditional partner, in a constructive and equitable manner. Even if there are currently some differences between us, they cannot and should not cast a shadow on our shared responsibility for the future of Europe and all of Eurasia.
Let me emphasise that the Great Eurasian Partnership and Belt and Road concepts are both rooted in the principles and values that everyone understands: the natural aspiration of nations to live in peace and harmony, benefit from free access to the latest scientific achievements and innovative development, while preserving their culture and unique spiritual identity. In other words, we are united by our strategic, long-term interests.
I strongly believe that the comprehensive approach that underpins both concepts will help us further enhance economic cooperation within the continent, develop shared transport and energy infrastructure and promote digital technology. This way, integration will serve the interests of our peoples and all Eurasian nations to the fullest extent.
Once again, I would like to thank our partners, our Chinese friends for this initiative. Thank you for your attention.
Thank you very much.
