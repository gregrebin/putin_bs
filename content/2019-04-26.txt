President of Russia Vladimir Putin: My dear friend, President Xi Jinping,
Thank you very much for the invitation to take part in the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. I must say right at the start that your initiative is making progress. It was timed to perfection and very successful. It is assuming a global nature and beginning to dictate the principles of building international relations and the norms of economic relations that are highly relevant in the world today.
This is an extremely important initiative, which is why it enjoys so much support around the world. The large number of participants who came to Beijing to take part in the discussion is direct evidence of this.
Russian-Chinese comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation are growing on all tracks. Our cooperation has reached an unprecedented high level, serving as an example of how inter-state relations should be built in the modern world.
In 2018, mutual trade increased by 24.5 percent to a record $108 billion. Last year, we set a target of $100 billion, that is, the development pace is very high.
You have already said that this year marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. Mr President, we are looking forward to your state visit to Russia, which will become a key political event of the year in bilateral relations.
I am very pleased to have this opportunity today to meet with you, with our Chinese colleagues and friends and discuss bilateral matters and aspects of international relations that are of mutual interest to us.
Russia is determined, as it always has been over the past decades, to expand the strategic partnership with China in all areas.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam State Counsellor, colleagues. I am very pleased to see you, and I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss things at the Beijing summit.
Myanmar is Russia’s long-time and reliable partner in Southeast Asia. Last year, we marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. We are committed to the further development of political dialogue and the continuation of inter-parliamentary exchanges. Our ministries of foreign affairs also have well-established contacts.
Although quite modest in absolute terms, our mutual trade is growing rapidly, having gained more than 50 percent last year.
There are regional issues, of course, which need to be focused on.
I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you and talk about all these issues.
State Counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi: We are also very glad to have this opportunity to meet. We tried to meet with you in Singapore, but it was not possible before. Of course, we have been friends with Russia for a long time, and we value this friendship and we also appreciate the support that you have given us on the international arena. Your ambassador has done very much to promote friendship between our two countries, I think primarily because of his fluent Myanmar language, which has impressed our people a lot and made him very popular. And we look forward to expanding our relations with Russia.

With President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues. I am happy to meet with you again.
Russia-Cyprus relations are traditionally friendly and are based on the principles of respect and consideration for one another’s interests. We have a comprehensive political dialogue. We constantly maintain contacts.
Our economic ties are also developing. Mutual trade in 2018 grew by almost 154 percent despite some external difficulties. An intergovernmental commission has been working as well.
We need to pay even more attention to direct contacts between business communities. And, of course, I would like to note the very large investment flows.
We understand that to a large extent this is repatriation of Russian capital from Cyprus, but still the $148 billion that came to the Russian economy from Cyprus is a significant sum.
Russia has $166 billion of direct investment in Cyprus. I do not know what other countries contribute so much to Cyprus. In any case, I reiterate, our relations are developing quite positively. We are pleased by that and I am glad to see you again, Mr President.
President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades (retranslated): Mr President, I am also very happy to meet with you.
Our relations are indeed developing positively. Both the relations and the contacts between our countries are developing. For many years, Russia has been a close partner and friend of Cyprus both at the political and economic levels.
This is also related to investment and the loan that you gave us during a difficult time for Cyprus. We appreciate the weapons systems that you provided to us, for defence purposes, of course.
We also appreciate the position Russia takes on the Cyprus issue. We know that you have wonderful relations with Turkey. We are concerned about this and hope that you can influence your partner in order to solve the Cyprus problem as soon as possible.
I would like to assure you again that on matters of principal, we remain loyal friends of Russia. This also concerns our position within the EEC and other international organisations. We share very close and sincere cooperation.
