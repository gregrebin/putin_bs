Speech at the Opening of Bulgarian Culture Days in Russia

The Bolshoi Theater, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
Today we are taking part in a truly momentous event. The Days of Bulgarian Culture in Russia are opening here on the stage of the Bolshoi Theater.
I think it is not accidental, but symbolic that they have coincided with the 125th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation and the recreation of the Bulgarian state. This event is unique in its scale and quality. It merits being treated as a milestone in the life of our two countries.
I have no doubt and am absolutely sure that it will be as successful as the Russian Culture Days in Bulgaria which we opened in March this year, as the Bulgarian President has already said, in a fraternal country, a country that we all love.
I am sure that the Bulgarian Culture Days in Russia will attract great attention.
The friendship between Russia and Bulgaria has deep roots. This friendship and these roots show how the destinies of our peoples are intertwined. Many centuries ago the linguistic and cultural kinship lent a special character, a fraternal character to our relations. We have much to be proud of, we have much to remember, and we have a good future.
Today we are well aware that close human contacts between Russia and Bulgaria are a guarantee not only of our successful cultural cooperation. These contacts also provide a solid basis for bilateral economic and political interaction.
Today we can say that the decline in our relations that lasted almost ten years is coming to an end. In the new conditions we are finding new common ground and establishing good contacts. I would like to identify such key areas of our interaction as energy, science and education. I think tourism is likely to be another important area.
I am convinced that the experience and depth of our long-time links enable us to raise the level of partnership, to build it on a modern economic basis and make it part of the new European cooperation.
I think that the Bulgarian Culture Days will give Russian society a multidimensional and objective idea of modern Bulgaria. Everyone who attends these events – and I think each of them should be a landmark – everyone who attends these events in Moscow, Yaroslavl or Vladimir will discover his or her own Bulgaria – ancient and modern, in some ways similar to us, but very original and extremely multifaceted.
In conclusion I would like to offer heartfelt thanks to the Bulgarian leadership, the President of Bulgaria and all those who took part in preparing this major event, and the Bulgarian cultural workers.
Allow me to wish success and all the best to the organisers and participants in the Bulgarian Culture Days in Russia. We will always look forward to seeing Bulgarian cultural workers in Russia. We will look forward to new meetings, new experiences and new friends. Thank you.

Opening Remarks at a Meeting with Members of the Central Electoral Commission
September 29, 2003
00:02
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
The anniversary of the electoral system in Russia comes at the beginning of the electoral campaign for elections of deputies to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia.
I must say that over 10 years, the Russian electoral system has passed very important stages in its formation, development, and undoubtedly the acknowledgement by the international community, which is also important from the viewpoint of the establishment of democracy in the country.
This date is a good opportunity for a balanced self-evaluation, for a summary – of course, an intermediary summary – and to clarify perspectives of development for the country’s electoral system.
The Russian Constitution determines the legal framework, the format, the fundament for the formation of bodies of state power, and for the construction of the entire electoral system.
Today, a significant amount of experience has been accumulated in election campaigns and on elections of various bodies of power and administration. Five federal election campaigns have been held, including elections to the State Duma, elections of the President of the country, and over 6,000 regional and local elections. An automated election system has been created, to a large extent thanks to your efforts, which can quickly calculate the results of voting right across the territory of the country. For us, of course, this is extremely important, bearing in mind the enormous size of our country.
Elections are always a very important political event in the life of any country, a powerful impulse and stimulus to the development of democracy. The most recent history of Russia has many times demonstrates the key role played by the institution of free elections. It is sufficient just to remember the serious crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, from which our country was able to emerge solely thanks to elections and the passing of the Constitution.
For us, it is obvious that elections are one of the political and legal tools of stable civil society and steady development of the state.
Today, it is necessary to increase the role and responsibility of political parties in the electoral process, to achieve full transparency of their financial activity.
And it is very pleasing for me to note that the Central Electoral Commission, everyone who has gathered today in this hall, the experts which you rely on – this entire group has made a very serious, significant and positive contribution in this process.
I believe a very serious achievement is the independence of electoral commissions, more active involvement of civil society in controlling the organization and process of voting, and calculating its results.
I would particularly like to note the activity of the Electoral Commission of the Chechen Republic. It is understandable that its members have to work in very serious conditions. Therefore it is very important for them to constantly feel our common support, the support of the Central Electoral Comission. It is also necessary to increase professionalism, and for them to feel the support of the country in your person.
In conclusion, I would like to wish you fruitful work.
