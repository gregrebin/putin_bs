Vladimir Putin: Mr President, allow me to greet you warmly. I know that your county's present situation is a very difficult one. All of us are fully aware of this. Literally today we received additional information on the tragedy that took place. First of all, allow me to express my condolences to you, the Iraqi leadership, and Iraqi society as a whole. I know that, together with the Iraqi leadership, you are taking all the necessary measures to provide security and favour a political settlement.
Russia and Iraq have always been connected by a bond of friendship. We intend to further develop relations between our countries on all levels, including political and economic ones. As you know, our experts are now returning to Iraq to continue their work in various fields in which we cooperate.
Certainly, it would be very interesting for me to hear your opinion on the process' development, the next steps the leadership of Iraq intends to take, and how Russia can be of help in the process of stabilising the situation in Iraq.
Jalal Talabani: Many thanks, Mr President. We highly value your assessment of the situation. We share your conviction that it is necessary to expand relations between the Russian Federation and Iraq as much as possible. The people of Iraq well know that Russia, and the Soviet Union in its time, gave a great deal of support to our country. Therefore, by expressing our gratitude for this help, we hope that our relations—both the traditional ones, and those in newer areas—will be expanded.
I will inform you of both the positive and negative aspects of what is now occurring in Iraq.
All of this is in the interest of strengthening our bilateral relations. We have no doubt that under your leadership, Russia will greatly contribute to strengthening our bilateral relations and support the people of Iraq in the struggle against terrorism.
We are united by common aims and common enemies. We believe that all the necessary bases for the development of bilateral political, trade and economic, cultural, and other relations exist between our traditionally friendly countries. On our side, we highly value the return of Russian experts to our country. We would very much want the largest possible number of Russian companies to return to Iraq. The leadership of Iraq and I myself will personally render comprehensive support to this process.
Many thanks for this reception.

Speech at the Session of the UN Security Council
September 14, 2005
22:32
New York
Vladimir Putin: Madam President, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me note at once, that Russia attaches special significance to today's Security Council summit.
By gathering here, we are doing more than demonstrating our shared responsibility and solidarity in the struggle against global terrorism. The main point is that the UN and the Security Council can become the coordinating centre, the unique “headquarters” of the international front against terrorism. It is here today, that important ideological, political, legal, and organisational bases of the struggle against terrorism will be laid. Russia can but welcome this approach, and is ready to take part in practical measures to strengthen the United Nation's central role in maintaining international security and stability.
We share the ideas contained in the Security Council resolution that was submitted for our consideration. This resolution contains more than just reflections on previous experience gained from combating terrorism, but sets new and serious tasks, including suppressing the instigation to terror. I am convinced that such practices must be considered criminal by all states without exception.
Our shared task is to create a united front in the struggle against this evil. Any attempts to instigate terrorism, accommodate terrorists, or use terrorists for political means or goals must meet general condemnation.
It is necessary to use not only states' ressources but those of civil society, mass media, cultural and educational cooperation, and interconfessional dialogue to oppose terrorist propaganda, racist ideology, and national and religious intolerance.
On behalf of our countries, we have just signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. As you know, Russia was the initiator of this document and we thank our partners for their support. The result of this teamwork is an effective legal tool to prevent real threats, such as terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction.
I also think that during the General Assembly's current session, the preparation for a comprehensive convention on international terrorism can be completed.
As a whole, the struggle against terrorism and its sources and the development of our cooperation in this area, should be a subject of constant attention of the United Nations, the Security Council, and the organisation's different bodies.
Dear Madam President, the Russian Federation is deeply convinced of the necessity to increase the efficiency of UN Security Council in the prevention of armed conflicts, including those in Africa.
In connection with this, we attach great value to the Council's resolution on this question.
I thank you for your attention.
