With President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I would like to welcome you in St Petersburg.
I already had the pleasure of listening to some of the discussions today, including the one in which you took part. I know that you have kept some of the subjects discussed at that meeting for our face-to-face discussion.
There are also some bilateral matters between Russia and the EU, the European Commission that are on the agenda today. It is a great pleasure to meet with you here at the St Petersburg Economic Forum to discuss all of these issues together.
Welcome!
President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker
(retranslated): Mr President, I have come to Russia because I wanted to see you. Some people in Europe did not approve of this idea, but it appealed to me because it is precisely when we have problems between us that we should meet and talk.
I hope that we will exchange views as frankly and openly as we have for many years now. I would also like to thank you for the very warm welcome that we have been given here. We have plenty to discuss, and it is particularly important that we make ourselves heard.

Meeting with members of Russian Direct Investment Fund International Expert Council and representatives of international investment community.
The President of Russia noted that during its existence the RDIF has achieved substantial results, among them, attracting over 760 billion rubles to the Russian economy.
The President said the state plans to top up the RDIF capital with additional funds received from the sale of public companies’ stock.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
I would like to welcome you once again in St Petersburg.
Heads of the leading world investment and sovereign funds from Europe, the United States, Asia and the Middle East have gathered here.
Our meetings on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum have already become a good tradition. I would like to exchange opinions with you on the broadest possible range of issues and discuss the opportunities opening up in Russia for making profitable investments and attracting capital.
Naturally, those who plan to invest in Russia or are already doing this will be interested in hearing our own assessments of our economic situation. I would like to say just a few words about this now.
We are essentially out of recession, and we have created the basic conditions for setting our economy on a growth trajectory. We have ensured macroeconomic stability and substantially reduced inflation. The actions of the Bank of Russia have allowed us to keep gold and currency reserves at high level. As you know, we have one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios.
Our economy has adapted to the new conditions. Moreover, it has gained competitive advantages by introducing a flexible rate for the national currency. Despite certain difficulties that definitely remain, we have not restricted capital flow. I would like to emphasise that we are not going to do this in the future. The Russian financial market is the most open among developing markets.
And, incidentally, our stock market – one of just a handful in the world – notably improved in the past year and the first five months of this year. Trading on the stock exchange has grown considerably in some categories of assets. Importantly, the scope of participation by foreign investors is broadening.
Good investment opportunities are opening up in various economic sectors: in industry, agriculture and infrastructure. Production with high added value, above all, has significant potential for growth.
For example, over the past three years, the capitalisation of some Russian chemical and instrument-making companies has grown at a rate of 30–40 percent and more.
Under import substitution programmes, we are setting up viable enterprises in Russia, capable of competing on foreign markets. To make them more efficient, we intend to implement far-reaching technological modernisation projects. Naturally, we are interested in modern technology coming into the country, along with capital. This process, of course, should be mutually beneficial, so we are offering attractive instruments.
One of them is a special investment contract. Under this contract, investors assume the obligation to raise the technological level, localise production in Russia and increase the share of exported goods. In exchange, they receive long-term guarantees, exemptions and other preferences.
We also see good investment opportunities in the so-called new markets, which ensure the dynamic development of advanced technology. Here, we have serious work in progress and can implement joint projects that are of interest to all.
Last year, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) accounted for almost 40 percent of foreign direct investment in the Russian economy. I would like to recall that we announced the creation of the RDIF five years ago here in St Petersburg. During this time the Fund has achieved significant results, including over 760 billion rubles invested in the Russian economy and the establishment of long-term partnerships with investors, many of whom had never invested in Russia before. Importantly, RDIF investment invariably shows high return rates, on average 30 percent, while projects that the Fund invests in show good dynamics.
I know that many of those present in this hall are successfully implementing their projects and cooperating with the RDIF. For example, 17 deals have been concluded with the UAE Sovereign Wealth Fund. Our Saudi Arabian colleagues have provided $10 billion for projects in Russia. Kuwait’s sovereign fund, which invariably participates in each RDIF deal, has doubled the volume of resources within the framework of this cooperation. This is, without a doubt, a clear indication of the great trust in the Fund and in Russia as a whole.
We have launched a number of landmark projects with RDIF’s partners. For example, RDIF joint investments with its Middle Eastern partners in the Russian Helicopters Holding will enhance our companies’ presence in international markets. I would like to note the Fund’s participation in import substitution programmes. For instance, RDIF and its Thai partners have invested together in a poultry farm cluster in the Leningrad Region, which we are visiting now. There are plans to build the largest dairy combine in Russia in another region, which will require a billion dollars in investment. These agro-industrial projects exemplify the advanced knowhow and technology that capital brings to Russia.
I would like to announce that a recently endorsed law gives the Russian Direct Investment Fund the status of Russia’s sovereign fund, which will improve the quality of its work, expand the set of its working instruments, and increase its independence to enhance the Fund’s stability. I am confident that it will generate interest in cooperation with Russia and investment in Russian assets. I would also like to note that we intend to increase RDIF’s capitalisation with extra funds obtained from selling shares of state-run companies.
We talked today with Russian Government members, the Minister of Economic Development among them. The Government supports this idea, and we will see which specific assets will bring in the extra revenues. The Finance Ministry need not exert itself: it is clear that the bulk of the profit should go toward budget revenue as the Budget Law stipulates. However, if we get some extra money, again, it will be used to increase the Fund’s capitalisation.
I hope that we will have a candid discussion today, as in past years, about all your concerns. It is sure to benefit our cooperation and increase your interest in working with us.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Secretary General, colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you in St Petersburg.
I would like to thank you for finding the time to come here to take part in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. We will, of course, use this opportunity to discuss the most important issues on the international agenda.
As you may know, Russia works actively in the Security Council and at all UN forums, and we support all your efforts, Mr Secretary General, to resolve the most complex international issues.
Welcome!
Ban Ki-moon: Mr President Putin, it is a great honour to meet you. Thank you for your time and thank for the invitation to this St Petersburg International Economic Forum. As I said this morning, I hope that given the long history of this forum, this will really contribute to revitalising the international economic situation, and also for the Russian economy, it will help the Russian economy.
Mr President, as you know, this is my last year as the Secretary General, and I cannot but express my deepest thanks and admiration and respect for your global leadership on many, many security developments and positions. For me it has been a great privilege and asset, a political asset, to have worked with Russia, Russian diplomats, and particularly yourself as the president. As a permanent member of the Security Council, you have given strong support for international peace and security, you devoted a great deal, and I will always cherish this support that you have given me.
Mr President, because of the time limit, if I may just begin reviewing certain situations, particularly Syria.

Meeting with Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.
Following the meeting, Mr Putin witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the Baltic LNG project by Royal Dutch Shell CEO Mr van Beurden and Chairman of the Gazprom Managing Committee Alexei Miller.
The memorandum reflects both sides’ interest in expanding cooperation in the LNG sector and opens the way for a feasibility study on building an LNG plant at the Leningrad Region port of Ust-Luga. This project will enable Gazprom to diversify its LNG sales.

Beginning of meeting with CEO of Royal Dutch Shell Ben van Beurden
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chief Executive Officer of Shell, colleagues, I would like to welcome you all in St Petersburg.
It is a great pleasure to see you again to discuss our joint work. Shell is our longstanding and reliable partner and one of the main distributors of Russian oil, accounting, I believe, for around 20 percent of the distribution. You have made significant investments – 10 billion – into the Russian economy and you have your own production network here, and your chain of petrol stations.
I would like to hear your views today on how your business is doing in Russia, and whether you have any questions, problems, comments or requests. Let me assure you that we will take your comments very seriously and will try to respond swiftly to any issues that you raise.
Mr van Beurden, I know that you have plans to develop your business here in Russia and I will be happy to discuss these new opportunities with you.
Welcome.
Ben van Beurden: Thank you very much, Mr President, as I said, it is very nice to see you back again, this time in your home town. Every time we meet, I’m impressed by how well you know my company and what we are doing in Russia. Our commitment to Russia is indeed enduring, but at the same time, Mr President, we live in very, very tough times in our industry. And as a result of it, we have to look very hard at the opportunities that we prioritise and the opportunities that we unfortunately have to forego.
But at the same time, tough times also bring us opportunities, and last time we met, Mr President, I talked to you about the acquisition of BG Group that we were planning at the time. That is now completed, and as a result of it we are now the largest private player in liquefied natural gas. We have a market share of about 15 percent globally.
We believe in gas, Mr President. We believe in the power of the gas market growing, and in that sense, we share the same vision as my friend Mr Miller does. The future of gas, for us, and for Russia by the way, will be bright. And that’s why last year Alexei Borisovich [Miller] and myself signed a strategic cooperation agreement working on both our strengths. We put a lot of emphasis and focus on development of Sakhalin and the Russian Far East, and we have made a lot of progress on that project since last time I briefed you on it two years ago at Novo-Ogaryovo in Moscow.
But our relationship is wider and deeper and we are also looking at other opportunities, and today I would also like to discuss with you an opportunity in the Baltic, the Baltic LNG export scheme that we are both studying. So, Mr President, I am equally looking forward to covering this in some detail with you and pointing out where we are making progress, and how we can still benefit from your continued support. So, thank you very much for the opportunity to have the discussion that we are going to have.
Vladimir Putin: Mr van Beurden, you mentioned the difficult conditions in which we are operating. The main difficulty today is that the global economy and the leading countries are not coping with the growth issue, namely that growth has slowed down in all of the world’s leading economies.
This has an impact on the demand for energy resources. We are fully aware that in this situation, companies very thoroughly consider the implementation of big projects, first calculating how the market will react to volumes of energy resources coming to international markets.
We understand this and are therefore willing to adapt our domestic fiscal policy so that companies can make long-term plans based on the current situation and on medium- and long-term forecasts. In this respect, the St Petersburg International Economic Forum is an excellent platform for an open discussion of these matters.

Meeting with President of Guinea Alpha Conde
Vladimir Putin met with President of Guinea Alpha Conde.

Meeting with President of Guinea Alpha Conde.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, let me wish you a warm welcome to Russia and St Petersburg.
The Republic of Guinea is our longstanding and reliable partner in Africa. Mr President, it is a great pleasure to meet you in person. I want to thank you for coming here and taking an active part in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.
Let me note that relations between our countries are developing very positively and the contacts between our foreign ministries show that we have very similar views on the situation in Africa and on current international affairs.
As for our economic ties, they are very modest for now in terms of value, but the trend is a good one and our trade increased 2.2-fold over the last year. Russian companies are already working on the market in Guinea and we know that other Russian companies are also showing an interest in entering your market and investing in your country. We will give them all the support they need and assist them in carrying out these plans.
Welcome!
President of Guinea Alpha Conde(retranslated): On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf I would like to thank you, Mr President, for this chance to come to Russia. It is a great pleasure to be here in Leningrad, as St Petersburg used to be known.
We know that you recently celebrated the Victory Day anniversary. This is a very important date, very important for the Russian people. During those days, the Nazi hordes surrounded Leningrad and started a blockade of the city, one of the most ruthless sieges in human history, but the people of Leningrad did not give in and through their courage defended their right to life, helping the troops to break through the blockade. I did some research and learned that your father was among those who participated in this heroic defence of Leningrad. It is therefore a particularly great honour for us to set foot on the soil of this city, which is drenched in the blood of those who fought for Russia’s freedom and gave their lives for its great future.
With your permission, we will also go to Moscow to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Of course, if we go to Moscow, we will certainly take the opportunity to visit the Lenin Mausoleum, because I belong to that generation for whom Lenin was a key figure of tremendous importance.
Mr President, let me take this opportunity to tell you how much Southern Africa, and Guinea in particular, owe the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognise our independence. We struggled for this independence in difficult conditions, with the colonisers, including General de Gaulle, against us, and so we are very grateful to the Soviet Union not just for the material assistance we received, but also for the moral support and the teachers you sent to us to help us train the people who then went on to defend our independence.
I remember the relations that developed between the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe, and I am sure that we should not underestimate the Soviet Union’s contribution to these ties. We believe that you were destined to lead your country as president, and despite the many difficulties we have all encountered since the Soviet Union’s collapse, we are nonetheless moving forward and are ratifying various bilateral agreements that help us to make progress on the bilateral track.
When I was getting ready to come here, I said to the presidents of the neighbouring countries that when I meet with you, I would say on behalf of all of Africa’s peoples that we trust your leadership and we have faith in you. It is an exceptional honour for us to take our relations with Russia to the strategic partnership level. We are sure that this relationship should be a long-term economic partnership that will let us make a bigger impact on the economic side of our bilateral ties. Rusal will serve as the driving force for this development. The company already has a presence in our country, and I hope that it will be the locomotive that will pull along with it other carriages with other Russian companies.
What is important is that the relations between our countries depend above all on the goodwill of our countries’ presidents. It is a great honour for me to meet you for this first time. We have much work ahead. We have a joint commission that prepares bilateral agreements, and work is currently underway on many documents. I hope that you will take the opportunity to come to visit us in Guinea for the signing of some of these agreements. In any case, we want you to know that we would always be extremely happy to welcome you in our country.
Thank you for giving me this chance to visit your country. If there is a need to sign any agreements, I would be happy to do so here, as your guest, but you are always welcome to come to our country and we would be happy to prepare a package of agreements for your visit. Russia already has good relations with southern and eastern Africa and Angola, and with Guinea such solidly sustained contacts are not yet in place.
I would very much like Guinea to become Russia’s gateway to this part of the African continent, so that other countries would also show interest and see that it is possible and necessary to work together with us, and Russia could expand its activities from us to the neighbouring countries. Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to assure you that we are ready to become your advance brigade that will help to ensure your entry onto the African continent.
