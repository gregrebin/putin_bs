With President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I would like to welcome you in St Petersburg.
I already had the pleasure of listening to some of the discussions today, including the one in which you took part. I know that you have kept some of the subjects discussed at that meeting for our face-to-face discussion.
There are also some bilateral matters between Russia and the EU, the European Commission that are on the agenda today. It is a great pleasure to meet with you here at the St Petersburg Economic Forum to discuss all of these issues together.
Welcome!
President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker
(retranslated): Mr President, I have come to Russia because I wanted to see you. Some people in Europe did not approve of this idea, but it appealed to me because it is precisely when we have problems between us that we should meet and talk.
I hope that we will exchange views as frankly and openly as we have for many years now. I would also like to thank you for the very warm welcome that we have been given here. We have plenty to discuss, and it is particularly important that we make ourselves heard.
