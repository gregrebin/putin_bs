President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
I am glad to welcome the leading business people of Russia and Japan. I met many of you at the second Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, and we also regularly meet at the annual St Petersburg International Economic Forum.
This direct contact with entrepreneurs is always useful and very interesting, providing first-hand information about the issues businesses are facing and what specific action is needed to improve the business climate.
First of all, let me emphasise that Japan is an important partner for Russia in the Asia-Pacific region. It is our sincere aspiration to strengthen and deepen Russian-Japanese ties, and of course to expand mutually-beneficial economic contact between our countries.
It is for this reason that trade and investment were among the key topics during the two days of intensive talks with Mr Abe. Of course, we also discussed the contentious issues inherited from the past. I am referring to the signing of a peace treaty.
At the same time, we regretted to note that trade between our countries has been declining recently. We agreed that we can put bilateral trade back on the path of sustainable growth. For that, we need our governments and business communities to step up their efforts.
We need to undertake new initiatives and projects and change the usual frameworks for cooperation by moving away from preferential deliveries of Russian oil and gas in exchange for Japanese equipment and cars. We need to diversify our trade and economic ties.
Building up cooperation in investment is also important. Over 50 new agreements and business contracts will be signed following today’s meeting.
Joint business projects are being implemented in various areas, including energy engineering, the automotive, the chemical, and the high-tech industries, to name a few. We are natural partners, as I mentioned earlier. We generally do not have to deal with the issues of competition, we can only create competitive advantages for each other, which are there for anyone to see.
I would like to note with satisfaction that the governments of Russia and Japan are committed to providing as much support to bilateral entrepreneurial initiatives as they can.
Agreeing on an ambitious plan for cooperation with a consolidated list of 90 priority projects in eight key areas, which were suggested by the Prime Minister during his visit to Russia in Sochi, was a positive step forward in this direction.
This includes energy industry, the manufacturing industry, agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure, innovation, small business, and exchanges in culture and education. They will be funded, among other sources, by the Russian-Japanese investment fund with a capital of $1 billion, which was created by the Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
Russia welcomes the participation of Japanese businesspeople in investment programmes that focus on the Russian Far East with its 13 priority development areas and the free port of Vladivostok. Foreign investors are granted a number of significant preferences, including special terms for building new production facilities, preferential tax treatment, and assistance in accessing the infrastructure.
This favourable business climate has been created in other Russian regions as well. The Russian regions are, in fact, competing with each other for investors, including foreign investors. The administrative and tax burden has been significantly reduced in Russia, supervisory holidays were introduced in 2016, and a moratorium on tax increases is in place.
We hope that Japanese businesses will make full use of the opportunities to cooperate with the Eurasian Economic Union. Russia is a member of this integration association, which is guided by the universal WTO rules and covers a vast market of 182 million consumers. By the way, experts will soon meet to discuss the creation of a free-trade area between the EAEU and Japan.
Russia is proactive in enhancing its macroeconomic stability. The Russian economy has proven to be resilient and capable of withstanding an unfavourable external environment. The Government enacted an anti-crisis programme to support the key industrial and financial sectors. Unemployment remained low, and debt stayed at reasonable levels.
Initiatives by the Bank of Russia to introduce a floating exchange rate helped the economy better adapt and preserve gold and foreign currency reserves with a trade surplus exceeding $71 billion, which is quite a positive result.
The Government is also consistent in its efforts to promote exports. The Russian Export Centre was established to promote competitive products on foreign markets.
Taken together, all these measures boosted Russia in the World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking to 40th place, up from 120th place in 2012.
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, I would like to wish every success to all forum participants. I hope that businesspeople in both Russia and Japan will continue to contribute positively to promoting multi-dimensional and mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries, and will create the conditions needed to normalise the relations between our countries to the fullest possible extent.
Thank you for your attention.

Beginning of Russian-Japanese talks
December 16, 2016

Tokyo
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): Mr President, colleagues,
I would like to thank all those who came here today on the occasion of Vladimir’s visit to Japan, Japanese officials and representatives of Japanese and Russian business.
This year, many high-level visits took place between the two countries, including visits by the Speakers of Russia’s State Duma and Federation Council, and reciprocal visits by the ministers present here, and others.
One of the factors that contributed to this positive trend is the economy.
When I talk about Japanese-Russian relations, I usually say “bilateral relations with the most enormous opportunities” because I am confident that the two neighbouring countries, Japan and Russia, have great potential for cooperation, which has yet to be tapped in certain areas.
I believe that it is our duty, as leaders of the two countries, to exploit the potential of Japanese-Russian relations, which is why when we met in May in Sochi, I decided to propose a cooperation plan to Vladimir that involved eight directions aimed at enhancing the economy and improving the lives of ordinary people.
This cooperation plan is based on the business relationship built through the efforts of our colleagues from the two countries present here today. Thanks to them, this cooperation plan has the ability to benefit the Japanese and the Russians.
For example, in a recent address to the Federal Assembly, while listing goals in the field of medicine, the President noted the needs associated with advanced medicine, higher quality of medical personnel, telemedicine and others.
The cooperation plan includes the Increasing Healthy Life Expectancy direction; within this track, we will hold consultations and define specific steps.
In addition, I would like to note how important it is that Japanese companies provide quality employment on the Russian labour market; they have already created about 13,000 jobs. Also, as more Japanese companies enter the Russian market, we can expect more improvements in the lives of ordinary people.
It has been seven months since I proposed the cooperation plan. During this period, we have elaborated on specifics of the plan uncommonly fast, with active involvement of the interested companies from the two countries. The outcome is that today we welcome more than 60 projects. Later, at the document exchange ceremony, we will confirm these projects as a result of Vladimir’s visit to Japan.
I would like to talk briefly about the Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic Issues. This commission supports the development of Russian-Japanese economic relations under the auspices of its chairpersons, Foreign Minister Kishida and Mr Shuvalov
. The commission discussed enhancing our economic ties and, as a result, 12 intergovernmental documents formalised our agreements. Today we are confirming them as our results.
I would like to take the opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all colleagues from the business community for their work and assistance in outlining the eight-point plan of cooperation and achieving results. Thank you.
It can be expected that our economic relations based on this cooperation plan will expand with more specific objectives and a larger number of projects. Yesterday, Vladimir and I came to the unanimous conclusion that we must develop our bilateral relations after the President’s visit to Japan in line with this thinking.
Among those present today are ministers interested in this cooperation in eight areas. I count on having a discussion about the future of bilateral relations with the business community in the context of the achieved results.
Also, considering the importance of the bilateral inter-regional exchanges, the guests today include the Governor of Hokkaido Ms Takahashi and the Governor of Miyagi Mr Murai.
Now let me introduce President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, who is visiting Japan for the first time in 11 years.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
Yesterday, we held detailed talks with Mr Prime Minister in Nagato; we discussed the state of the entire range of Russian-Japanese relations, including political issues and the possibility of signing the peace treaty. I would like to thank you and your colleagues for the very warm atmosphere that was created during our work yesterday.
It is now possible to conduct a more detailed conversation on issues of trade, economic and investment cooperation with representatives from governments and business communities. I suppose it is this kind of work, along the economic track, that will help create the foundation needed to launch truly partner-like relations between our countries.
The economies of Russia and Japan are basically complementary and have few competitive conflicts. As Mr Abe has just said, we have to work to unlock the potential of our bilateral ties. The action plan, suggested by Mr Prime Minister that includes projects in eight main areas, and our proposals on high-priority projects, can serve as a good foundation for this.
The governments of both countries have already prepared a concise list of joint initiatives in such areas as the power-generating sector, industry, medicine, agriculture, and for small and medium-sized businesses. I hope that today’s dialogue will help us discuss the current state of affairs in detail and chart new goals for cooperation.
