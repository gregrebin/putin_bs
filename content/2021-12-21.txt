Speech at ceremony for induction of Knyaz Oleg and Novosibirsk missile carriers into the Navy
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers,
Greetings and congratulations on a new important milestone in the history of the Russian Armed Forces.
Today, naval flags will be raised on nuclear submarines Knyaz Oleg and Novosibirsk as the new missile carriers are becoming part of the Navy.
I would like to thank the workers of Sevmash, which is our leading manufacturer of nuclear-powered submarines, and to thank everyone who participated in designing and creating these modern ships. You have done an excellent job.
The new submarines have a formidable striking power. Knyaz Oleg is equipped with Bulava ballistic missiles while all-purpose submarine Novosibirsk has Kalibr and Oniks cruise missiles and is able not only to effectively neutralise sea-based targets, but also to deliver high-precision strikes against targets on land.
Very soon, Knyaz Oleg and Novosibirsk will become part of the Pacific Fleet and will significantly boost its combat potential. They will ensure Russia’s security and reliably protect our national interests in the World Ocean.
The new submarines are the first serial ships built under these projects, and we will continue to create these ships. Under the current state armament programme, five more Borey-A project submarines and six Yasen-M project submarines will be built and will join the fleet. Sevmash will build them all.
We will step up our efforts to renovate the Navy, to build modern submarines and surface ships of various designs and classes, to simultaneously develop coastal infrastructure and, of course, to improve the social guarantees for military personnel and boost the prestige of military professions.
Service in the Navy has become the life calling for many generations of sailors. The Defence Minister has just told me that seven family members of the Novosibirsk underwater missile cruiser commander, Captain 1st rank Shpirko, seven officers, have devoted their lives to service in the Navy at different times. This is a good example of preserving the glorious traditions of the Navy, devotion and loyalty to the Navy and the Motherland.
In conclusion, I would like to once again thank everyone who was involved in creating these formidable ships. I am confident that Knyaz Oleg and Novosibirsk crews will make a worthy contribution to strengthening Russia’s defence capability and protecting our people.
I wish you every success in your service.
I propose that we raise the flags.
