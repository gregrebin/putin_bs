Constitutional Court President Valery Zorkin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Zorkin, greetings on Constitution Day.
This is not an ordinary Constitution Day, because today is the 25th anniversary of the country’s fundamental law. The Constitutional Court bears special responsibility for ensuring compliance with this crucial legal instrument. I would like to express gratitude to you, the other judges and personnel of the Constitutional Court for doing their jobs.
Many articles in our Constitution are directly applicable, which places special responsibility on those who must ensure compliance with these provisions, because this allows the Constitutional Court to take direct decisions regarding the interpretation of constitutional provisions. I would like to thank you for doing this important and highly responsible job well and for attaining good results. I also wish all the best to you and all your colleagues.
Constitutional Court Chairman Valery Zorkin
: Thank you, Mr President.
We remember that the Constitution includes provisions not only on the Constitutional Court, but also on the Guarantor of the Constitution and other authorities. Therefore, our far from simple task is to work together with the other authorities to keep our Constitution alive, to prevent it from gathering dust.
I think that this has so far been possible, because it is a silver anniversary of the Constitution, which will be followed by a golden anniversary and so on. Thank you very much.
Taking this opportunity, I want to convey the judges’ heartfelt congratulations to you. I brought a small package [with books about the Constitutional Court]. This is a selection of our most important rulings. They represent the generalised practice of the [Constitutional Court].
This is only a small portion of the rulings, because we receive about 15,000 petitions a year. However, it is not the quantity, but the quality of the rulings that matters.
We strive to support the most important areas where a breakthrough is possible, where the Constitution may not work too well, if, say, the legislators failed to do their job properly, or the practice has taken the wrong turn.
However, I would like to emphasise that we have issued more rulings related to constitutional interpretation lately than on the violation of the Constitution.
It is often said that the Constitutional Court is doing little in this regard. I want to say that the legislative framework has been created, so there are fewer errors.
Vladimir Putin: Of course.

Ceremony for presenting national awards for outstanding achievements in human rights and charity work.
Chairman of the National Society of People with Disabilities Mikhail Terentyev received the human rights award for 2018. The award for achievements in charity work was presented to Lev Ambinder, president of Rusfond Charity Fund for Seriously Ill Children, Orphans and Disabled Persons.
The Executive Order establishing the awards was signed more than three years ago. Since then, the President has presented them twice: in 2016, to Yelizaveta Glinka and Director of the Children's Hospice Alexander Tkachenko; and in 2017, to Lyudmila Alekseyeva and chairman of a charity fund for children with leukaemia in the Republic of Tatarstan Vladimir Vavilov.

Speech at the ceremony for presenting national awards for outstanding achievements in charity work and human rights
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
Today, here in the Kremlin, we are celebrating our estimable fellow citizens, recipients of the national awards for outstanding achievements in human rights and charity work, and paying tribute to their accomplishments and selfless work.
This is the main purpose of today’s ceremony. However, these awards have a special dimension and a high mission of their own.
They help the government and society in general focus more on the important issues that today’s recipients are committed to resolving – issues that often, in the most direct, literal sense determine people's lives. I think that for the recipients themselves this is no less – and maybe even more – important than the well-deserved national awards.
At the ceremony for presenting national awards for outstanding achievements in human rights and charity work.
Friends, your achievements remind us again and again of how powerful and effective charity and compassion can be. How there is no limit to what someone driven by a sincere desire to help others and uphold truth and justice can do.
We see how these seemingly simple, but at the same time defining values are resonating with our citizens and becoming a natural moral compass in their daily actions and deeds.
I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words about the people who are receiving the awards today.
The national award for outstanding achievements in human rights protection goes to Mikhail Terentyev.
The National Society of People with Disabilities, which he heads, unites more than 1.5 million people. As you may be aware, there are 12 million people with disabilities in our country. It is important to consider and advance their interests and to consistently protect their rights.
I believe that in matters of creating an accessible environment, we, including through Mr Terentyev’s efforts, have managed to make major progress in recent years.
Caring for the needs of people with disabilities is becoming the norm, while any attempts to discriminate against them, any cases of unfair treatment are met with a sharply negative reaction from our citizens.
Still, by and large, to be honest, we are only at the beginning of the road today, and there is still a lot to be done, there is still so much to be done.
With Chairman of the National Society of People with Disabilities Mikhail Terentyev, laureate of the National Award for outstanding achievements in human rights.
We are now starting to implement new national projects. Their main goal, their idea is to achieve positive changes for each person, which means developing healthcare, education, transport infrastructure, creating a new comfortable environment for living in urban and rural areas.
We are obliged to think about people with disabilities, to consider their special needs. Working in close contact with public associations, we must not overlook any detail that affects their quality of life or their ability to exercise their rights. This is our direct responsibility.
President of the Rusfond charity fund for seriously ill children Lev Ambinder is the recipient of the Russian Federation National Award for charity work.
Mr Ambinder has been running Rusfond since 1996, when the very concept of charity was just beginning to return to our country. And it was he who laid the foundations for a professional, reliable, and efficient charitable organisation.
More than 6.5 million Russians have donated to Rusfond, and more than 20,000 children have received necessary treatment.
Without exaggeration, every life saved is priceless. And behind each of them lies the caring, disinterested impulse of so many people. I would like to sincerely thank all those who consider it their duty to respond to the pain of others, to thank all our benefactors.
I will also note Mr Ambinder’s and the Rusfond team’s efforts to create a national registry of bone marrow donors. This is a very important project, which requires combined efforts of the state, society, charitable and non-profit organisations, so that all those who need such operations can receive the help they need in time.
With president of Rusfond Charity Fund for Seriously Ill Children, Orphans and Disabled Persons Lev Ambinder, laureate of the National Award for outstanding achievements in charity work.
Friends,
Public opinion, the active participation of citizens in the life of the country, an active civil society represent a tremendous force whose importance for Russia's steady progress and its consolidation, the consolidation of our people, is, without exaggeration, decisive.
You are probably aware that yesterday we marked the 100th anniversary of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s birth.
According to the writer, the air of social relations and their purity is a more fundamental value than the level of abundance, industrial development and even the system of governance. These relations determine the life of the country and its future.
Today’s laureates are working to make sure that no one has to bear their misfortune alone, that everyone has both help and support when they need it most. It is you who create and strengthen the atmosphere of justice and goodness that we all, the whole society – the state and the people – need so badly. This is the very “air” of human relations Alexander Solzhenitsyn spoke about.
Thank you very much for this!
Thank you for your attention.
