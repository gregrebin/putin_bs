President Vladimir Putin: Your Highness! Dear Colleagues!
Hello! I am delighted to welcome you to Moscow.
I very clearly recall our visit to Saudi Arabia. I remember how warmly and cordially you welcomed us to your country. And first and foremost I want to take this opportunity to convey our warmest greetings and best wishes to the King of Saudi Arabia, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
I am very pleased that relations between our countries are developing in virtually all areas: this includes our political cooperation and in the economic sphere, where we have very promising long-term projects.
We particularly welcome your visit to Moscow in view of the role played by Saudi Arabia in the attempt to find a Middle East settlement. As you know, things are not going well at all in this respect.
Welcome!
Prince Bandar Bin Sultan: Thank you Your Excellency!
It is truly an honour to meet with you today, Your Excellency. The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques asked me to convey his greetings to you. He sends his warmest regards and he still recalls your last visit to Saudi Arabia with pleasure.
I would also like to thank my colleague – and all my colleagues – with whom I met with during my visit to Russia for the very warm welcome. We felt that we were among friends.
The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is paying a great deal of attention to developing our countries’ relations in the political, economic and cultural spheres. He considers our relationship a strategic one.
