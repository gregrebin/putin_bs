President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I would like to tell you, friends, that our efforts were not in vain – we worked in a businesslike and truly constructive spirit, in the traditional atmosphere of mutual understanding and, I would like to emphasise, trust and sincere friendship that characterises Russia-Africa cooperation.
We had a meaningful and interested exchange of views on the entire range of strategic cooperation between Russia and African nations.
In addition, during plenary sessions, numerous bilateral meetings, thematic roundtable discussions and panel sessions, we reviewed in detail current global problems, issues of world economics and politics, food and energy security, stable and sustainable development and cultural and humanitarian cooperation.

We determined the main areas of our further joint work and mapped out our plans for enhancing foreign policy coordination, building up trade and investment flows and promoting industrial cooperation between Russia and African countries.
We talked about the training of top professionals for African national economies.
We drafted and approved the main declaration of the second Russia-Africa Summit and a number of thematic declarations – on preventing an arms race in space, cooperation in international information security, and enhancing cooperation in countering terrorism. In addition, the plan of action of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum for 2023–2026 is ready for adoption. Colleagues, if nobody objects, let us consider these most important documents adopted. (Applause.) No objections at all? Thank you.
In general, we highly value the results of our joint work at the summit. I am sure the achieved results are creating a good foundation for further deepening the Russia-Africa partnership in the interests of our nations’ prosperity and wellbeing.
Thank you very much for your joint work today in this format.
We still have a number of events ahead.
Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
We appreciate that you decided to personally lead the Cameroonian delegation at the Russia–Africa summit in St Petersburg. This is your first visit to Russia, although we have kept in touch regularly over the telephone. Thank you for making the decision to come personally.

The ties between Russia and Cameroon are built on mutual respect and partnership. Next year we will celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations. We hope that our meeting will serve as an additional impetus to strengthening interaction between our two countries. We are in favour of invigorating our political dialogue and expanding contacts at all levels.
Unfortunately, bilateral trade decreased slightly last year. Despite a decline in Russian exports, imports from Cameroon to Russia grew more than 17-fold. The main thing is to ensure the stability of our trade indicators.
We will continue to render assistance to Cameroonians who wish to study at Russian higher educational institutions; a total of 2,000 specialists have undergone training in our country. Currently, 814 Cameroonian citizens are studying in Russia, with 47 of them receiving state scholarships. We doubled the quota for Cameroonian citizens to 100 scholarships for the upcoming academic year.
We have noted that Cameroonians are interested in studying the Russian language. A centre of open education in Russian, which has over 150 school and university students, opened in Duale in April.
Russia and Cameroon have similar approaches to international issues. We stand for a polycentric world order, the principle of the rule of law, and rejection of dictate and double standards in international affairs.
We appreciate your support for a number of Russian initiatives at the UN platform. Overall, I believe that we have been working quite energetically and have achieved success on key tracks.
Welcome once again, Mr President.
President of Cameroon Paul Biya (retranslated): Mr President of the Russian Federation,
First and foremost, I would like to thank you for the invitation to this important summit between the Russian Federation and Africa. I would also like to thank you for the wonderful welcome. We enjoyed a very warm reception.
We are grateful to you for the excellent organisation of our work. We came here because diplomatic ties between our countries go back decades. You mentioned the successes in our relations, and we will discuss this further as well.
We came here in the belief that the summit will be an opportunity to strengthen friendly ties between the Russian Federation and Cameroon even further.

This also applies to the Economic and Humanitarian Forum, sessions of the summit and a special meeting with the heads of African regional organisations. Tonight, we will also discuss the situation around Ukraine with interested African countries.
We had many bilateral contacts with African leaders. We have planned meetings with all heads of state that are present in St Petersburg.

Documents adopted and signed following the second Russia-Africa Summit
July 28, 2023
Of course, we are happy that the delegations of the overwhelming majority of African countries and the heads of all leading integration structures of Africa are taking part in the summit.
Representatives of African states displayed political will and demonstrated their independence and interest in developing cooperation with our country. We appreciate this and are convinced in the successful future of Russia-Africa relations. They rest on the traditions of time-tested friendship, and historical experience of multifaceted productive interaction dating back to the early period in the process of African states’ formation.
The main thing is that the summit has again confirmed the firm resolve of both Russia and Africa to continue developing mutually beneficial partnership and seeking its new forms and areas.
Indicatively, following the work, the participants adopted a solid package of joint documents. First, I will mention the St Petersburg Declaration that was approved by the leaders. It formalises strategic areas for the development of Russia’s cooperation with African countries in long-term perspective. All our states confirmed their commitment to the formation of a fair and democratic multipolar world order based on the universally recognised principles of international law and the UN Charter. They expressed their joint resolve to counter neocolonialism, the practice of using illegitimate sanctions and attempts to undermine traditional moral values.
The Sochi agreement has been confirmed – to hold Russia-Africa summits every three years.
A dialogue partnership mechanism will operate in between Russia-Africa summits. Foreign ministries of Russia and African countries and the heads of the African Union will continue their regular political consultations. We are also planning to establish a new permanent Russia-Africa mechanism for coordinating our positions on security issues, including such urgent problems as countering terrorism and extremism, ensuring food security, information technology, preventing the deployment of arms in space and climate change.
Characteristically, our African friends expressed many constructive ideas and useful practical considerations during the current meeting. We will certainly consider them.
We adopted separate declarations on many areas of Russia-Africa cooperation, in which we detailed our coordinated approaches and guidelines for further joint actions.
The large-scale Action Plan until 2026 contains specific goals on invigorating the Russia-Africa economic and humanitarian partnership and implementing decisions of the Petersburg summit as a whole. We are planning to build up our trade in quality and quantity and improve its pattern. We are also going to gradually switch to national currencies, including the ruble, in making financial payments on commercial deals. We will be removing trade barriers by aligning integration processes in the Eurasian Economic Union and the African Union and its free trade area. We intend to increase exports to Africa of Russian industrial products that have earned a good reputation on the continent, including machinery, automobiles, equipment, chemicals and fertilisers.
Our country will continue supplying our African friends with crops both contractually and free of charge, help them develop their power industry to meet the growing needs of the African economies in hydrocarbon fuel and electricity generating capacities. Importantly, I am referring not only to traditional energy sources but also to Rosatom’s innovations.
The Action Plan, along with several other inter-departmental and commercial documents signed on the sidelines of this summit, also provide for expanding industrial cooperation and carrying out joint information and communications projects. In particular, our companies are ready to transfer applied technology to be used in public administration, in the banking and other sectors of the economy to our African friends.

An understanding has been reached at the summit on the importance of more energetic efforts to promote cultural, academic, educational, sports, tourism, youth and other humanitarian exchanges. Russia is also offering a lot to its African friends and colleagues in this area.
Cooperation will continue in education and personnel training, and the number of African students receiving education in Russia will be increased, including government-funded students. Branches of Russia’s leading universities, as well as secondary schools, including those with several subjects taught in Russian, will be opened in African countries through joint efforts. Relevant initiatives were examined in detail at the meetings that took place.
Of course, we also plan to assist our African partners in strengthening their national healthcare systems and enhancing their reliability, technological level, potential for fast response and resilience in coping with epidemics. For this purpose, an ambitious programme will be launched to assist African countries in combatting infections through 2026, for a total amount of 1.2 billion rubles.
We still have work ahead at the summit but right now I still want to thank again all our African colleagues for accepting our invitation to come to St Petersburg and for coming. I want to emphasise again that Russia sincerely aspires to build a truly strategic and diverse partnership with Africa and we see that our African friends are also seeking to work together with us, arm in arm.
Thank you.
Chairperson of the African Union, President of the Union of the Comoros Azali Assoumani (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
You have said this very well. I can only thank you very sincerely: thank you, dear brother. I would also like to thank all the agencies of the Russian Federation, the Russian people for this brotherly and very warm welcome. I would like to especially note the optimal conditions created for this summit to become a true success.
Once again, Mr President, thank you very much, I would also like to congratulate you, because you will not regret any of the decisions you have made.
We have truly achieved success both for President Putin, who invited us, and also for all of us Africans. If Russia wins, Africa wins with it. (Applause.)
We continued last night’s discussions today, and, when delivering our remarks, we thanked you and noted the relations that have existed between our countries and Russia for many decades.
We know that friends in need are friends indeed. And it was precisely when Africa was in a difficult situation, during the period of slavery, the period of colonisation or the period of apartheid, that Russia always helped us, and it was among the first countries to help us fight against colonisation, apartheid and slavery.
That is why we have a relationship that extends back ages. Of course, I believe it will develop one way or another. Indeed, it is time to give these relations a new boost and move forward.
We have discussed numerous problems, which President Putin also mentioned. What can be noted? We can note that Russia is ready to help us in education and personnel training, because human resources are very important to us.
Almost all African countries sent their students to be trained in Russia, and all these specialists are now working both in the private sector and government administration. We will move forward together. We know that Russia has all the necessary potential, and it must be used fully. We have already talked about this. We will go even further.
Yes, we maintain cooperation. We held the first summit in 2019, but, unfortunately, then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, so we had to suspend the implementation of our plans. During that summit, we said that a mechanism should be established to help us achieve more and also draw a line, understand what we managed to do, what we failed to do and how we can correct our mistakes.
There are many candidates in Africa who are ready to host this summit, including the Comoros. We have discussed all possible topics, the whole spectrum: energy and infrastructure. We have also demonstrated that we have our own African potential. We only have to use this material, this capital for our common good. We need to take advantage of these capacities and create a value-added product.
Yes, we gained political independence but it is still remains at the political level. We must move forward. We have the capital and we are now exporting our raw materials. Later, these transformed minerals return to us and we buy them at a much higher price.
We know that Russia can help us with this. It has demonstrated its readiness. In fact, it is already doing this in many countries. This concerns processes of industrialisation and numerous areas – energy, agriculture and so on.
I would like to note again that I believe success awaits us. We are very grateful and content with the results of our meetings.
We inhabit the same world and want Africa to become part of decision-making organisations. We live in a multipolar world. Russia will invest in Africa but this does not mean that other countries won’t come to us. We will create conditions for positive competition. We won’t have just one and only partner – we will have many partners. I think it would be even better for us to have two or three partners because they will attract other partners.
Thank you very much, Mr President. Thank you very much, Russia. You have always been with us.
We are creating a free trade area in Africa. I believe it is a good model and it will help us move forward and develop as well. As the Chairperson [of the African Union], I can speed up the establishment and development of this free trade area.
I am convinced that together with Russia, with its support and partnership, we will be able to implement this project and achieve concrete results.
We discussed the issue of grain and grain supplies. The President of Russia said he is ready to help us even for free. Yes, there are attempts to unblock the current situation. We will see how this can be done, how to ease this burden.
Yes, we know that there is a war between Russia and Ukraine, and this is affecting the global economy. We visited Kiev and held talks there. Tonight we will discuss this issue with the President of Russia as well. We will find a solution.
The President of Russia demonstrated his readiness to help us with grain supplies. Yes, this is important but probably not quite enough. It is necessary for us to achieve a ceasefire because war is always unpredictable and the longer it lasts, the less predictable it becomes.
President Putin told us that he is ready to engage in a dialogue and find a solution. Now we have to convince the other side. I hope we will make it. We noted, we remain convinced that it is still possible to do this, and this fills us with optimism. We are acting as a mediator. We will talk with both sides. I hope we will achieve positive results.
Thank you very much, Mr President.

Meeting with President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am delighted to welcome you, Mr President. We keep in touch with you on a constant basis. Thank you for accepting the invitation to take part in the Russia–Africa summit.
Based on the time-tested traditions of Soviet-African friendship, we aim to consistently develop mutually beneficial ties with the countries on the continent and – as you know, I have repeatedly mentioned this – to expand cooperation in all areas: in politics, the economy and in the humanitarian sphere.
Mr President, we highly appreciate your sincere desire to promote Russia-CAR partnership across the board.
As I have said, you found an opportunity to come to St Petersburg, despite an important domestic political event in your country – the national referendum on a new constitution. I wish you a successful completion of the referendum for the benefit of the republic and its citizens. Events of such calibre are obviously aimed at enhancing domestic political stability, which is essential for development, including in the economy.

I would like to emphasise that cooperation between our countries has received a good boost in recent years. We consistently support the efforts taken by the CAR leadership to enhance national sovereignty and defence capacity, and tackle extremist and terrorist groups. We provide practical assistance to you and will continue to do so.
Regrettably, our trade and economic ties so far fall behind the general level of cooperation. But we are committed to taking efforts to improve the situation, including through promoting ambitious projects.
You arrived in Russia together with a representative delegation that includes members of your government. I hope their meetings with their Russian colleagues will be productive. We see significant potential in such areas as joint mining projects, development of energy and agro-industrial industries, and deliveries of Russian-produced equipment and agricultural machinery.
Mr President, as you know, we offer humanitarian support as well. In August 2022, a batch of food was donated to the republic as part of Russia’s voluntary targeted contribution under the UN World Food Programme.
We have noted Central African citizens’ growing interest in studying at Russian universities. To this end, we have increased the scholarship quota for Central African students from the Russian federal budget for 2023–2024.
The Russian House, a Russian cultural centre opened in Bangui in 2021, makes an immense contribution to the expansion of humanitarian ties through offering Russian language courses and organising educational events for Central Africans to get a better understanding of our history and culture.
Our countries share a common stance in the international arena; we coordinate steps on major regional and global issues and appreciate the support you offer to us within the UN as well as other international organisations.
Once again, I would like to thank you for being here with us today at the Russia–Africa summit in St Petersburg. Thank you.
President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. On my own behalf and on behalf of my delegation, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the invitation we received. Thank you for hosting the Russia–Africa Forum. It is very important to us. It represents the expectations and hopes of all African countries and the Central African Republic, in particular.
I also want to focus on something you have already noted, the remarkable level of relations between the Central African Republic and the Russian Federation. Rooted in history, this cooperation has recently progressed by leaps and bounds. We want to thank you, the Russian Federation, the Russian Government and the Russian people for this. Thank you very much for the interest you show and for the support we continuously receive from the Russian Federation.
You know that recent years, including 2003 and 2013, were challenging for our country. It was fully controlled by armed groups in 2016; there were coup attempts and security problems. But thanks to the help from the Russian Federation, we now live in peace and stability. We genuinely appreciate this important support. Thank you on behalf of the people of the Central African Republic.
We wish to continue this cooperation. Our country still faces certain challenges today. I would like to remind you that, nevertheless, we have made progress and improvements thanks to this bilateral cooperation and your support. However, there is still a lot to be done to achieve actual success. We rely on you, Mr President, and hope that this bilateral cooperation will be intensified and will continue further in the future.
Indeed, our country faces a significant number of problems. Many cities in the CAR are fully liberated from terrorist groups but there are so-called “pockets” where these groups remain and the state has still to regain control of those territories.
We sincerely thank you, Mr President, for supporting us in the UN Security Council. You also mentioned this. You know that we are under unprecedented pressure, being target of misinformation campaigns. But thanks to the support of your representatives in the UN Security Council, the position of the Central African Republic can be defended. Thank you once again. If I remember correctly, your representative supported our position yesterday at the Security Council meeting on lifting the embargo on weapon supplies to the Central African Republic. I hope we will continue working on this issue because we were not satisfied with the proposed draft. I hope we will work together to ensure that the embargo is lifted. We believe it was imposed unfairly.
Our country is restoring its constitutional order. We have achieved significant progress. I believe that in the current conditions, extending the embargo humiliates the Central African nation as it legitimises terrorist groups by treating the terrorist groups on a par with the government. I believe it is unfair.
Once again, I sincerely thank you for your help. Thank you very much.
As for cooperation, we already appealed to you in the past and you approved fuel supplies. I think we have found common ground on this matter although there may be small obstacles. I really hope that you will be able to issue instructions on finalising this agreement.
I am familiar with one of your companies, Rosgeologia, with which we cooperate on geological prospecting and exploration. It is an important aspect for our country.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin (in English): Dear friends! Are you ready?
Let’s start the evening part of our programme. I am very glad to see you. As agreed, we will talk about issues and problems related to the conflict in Ukraine.

Joint Statement Issued following the Engagement between the President of the Russian Federation and the Leaders of the African Peace Initiative
August 4, 2023
During our June meeting here in St Petersburg, we discussed in great detail the situation which caused the conflict and shared our opinions on possible settlement options. President of the South African Republic, Mr Ramaphosa, a co-author of the peace initiative, voiced specific proposals contained in it. We carefully analysed the thoughts and ideas expressed by our African friends. We treat this very seriously and with great attention.
Colleagues, I hope that you have a clear understanding of the nature and origins of the crisis. In any case we tried to make our view on that problem clear. We believe that the problem did not arise yesterday; it was provoked by some forces in the West which have been preparing for a hybrid war against our country for many years. They did everything to turn Ukraine into a tool to undermine the security foundations of the Russian Federation, to harm Russia’s positions in the world and to undermine our statehood. I am saying this with good reason. This is the first point.
The second thing I would like to draw your attention to: today, at the beginning of our discussion, the Chairperson of the African Union said something that caught my attention. I did not respond to it right away but I wrote it down. Colleague, you mentioned that “we are against coups d'état.” And I completely agree with this stance – we are against them, too. But the second problem that led to the current crisis is exactly the coup d'état in Ukraine in 2014. It was essentially an anti-constitutional violent armed state coup, which was actively supported by Western countries that ignored all norms of international law and admitted openly and publicly that they were backing this coup, unabashedly specifying the amount of funding they had spent on it.
I know that you are earnestly seeking to provide assistance in reaching a just and sustainable solution to the conflict. And, of course, we greatly appreciate your balanced approach, as well as the fact that you have not supported the anti-Russian rhetoric and anti-Russian campaign. If you had, we would not be having this conversation right now, obviously.
We are impressed by the stance of the countries that came out with the initiative saying that the UN Charter principles must be respected and observed in their entirety, with due account of the interconnections that exist between them. Indeed, there must be no double standards, no unilateral sanctions or attempts to ensure one’s own security at the expense of others.
We are being told that we are violating the UN Charter. I do not think so. Quite the opposite: I am confident that we have acted in full accordance with the UN Charter. Following the 2014 coup d'état, the Ukrainian authorities unleashed hostilities against part of their citizens, using aircraft, heavy equipment and tanks to target those who did not support the Western-backed coup in 2014. Therefore, it was the West that unleashed the war in Ukraine. That is exactly the way things happened, and there is no denying it.
For our part, we made every attempt to peacefully resolve this crisis by signing the so-called Minsk agreements, which the Ukrainian authorities derailed by completely disregarding them, with the West’s approval. Furthermore, they later stated they were not going to comply with these agreements.
We were forced to recognise the independence of certain territories; for eight years, we had not recognised the independence of these newly established republics and had sought to achieve a peaceful settlement. So, we recognised the independence of these newly formed states and signed treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with them – all done within the UN Charter – and within these treaties, we responded to their appeal for help, in full accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. There were no violations of the UN Charter here.
But our Western partners forgot what they did in Iraq, destroying the country’s statehood and ultimately eliminating Saddam Hussein. They forgot the way they acted in Libya, without any resolution from the UN Security Council. They forgot they ruined the situation in Sudan. They forgot that they invaded Syria. They could not care less about the UN Charter. They think of international law only when they believe they can use these tools against someone – in this case, against Russia. But they will fail; this approach is too primitive. If they actually want someone to observe the UN Charter as well as other norms of international law, they should themselves take the effort to fulfil them.
This is not to say we do not want or do not seek the peaceful resolution of any dispute. As I said, we have thoroughly considered both your approach and your ideas for a peace settlement.
They actually reiterate provisions of the peace plan that the People’s Republic of China proposed in February to resolve the situation around Ukraine. However – and this is also well known – the Ukrainian authorities issued special regulations, with a decree adopted by the President of Ukraine that prohibits any negotiations. For our part, we have never refused to take part in negotiations; we have always stated publicly that we are prepared for further dialogue.

As I said at our previous meeting in St Petersburg, a draft agreement had been basically coordinated. But after we withdrew our troops from the area near Kiev, which we were asked to do to create conditions for a final peace treaty, the Ukrainian authorities abandoned all previous agreements. So I believe that the ball is absolutely in their court.
Obviously, I will not dwell on the details of what we agreed upon as this would probably be inappropriate. But let me remind you – not everyone knows this but we know it perfectly well – that Kiev gained its independence upon the collapse of the Soviet Union under the Declaration of Independence, which clearly states that Ukraine is a neutral state – and for us, this has fundamental importance. The reasons the West started drawing Ukraine into NATO are not very clear to us.
We believe this is what poses a fundamental threat to our security, because the advancement of the hostile military alliance’s infrastructure towards our borders is unacceptable.
There are also other issues that must be resolved. Naturally, we can talk about them in more detail in the restricted part of our meeting.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr Chairperson of the African Union, please go ahead.
Chairperson of the African Union and President of the Union of the Comoros Azali Assoumani (retranslated): Thank you very much.
Indeed, we have already discussed many issues. Today, we would like to see how things are progressing, and with President Cyril Ramaphosa as initiator, I think he should take the floor.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, please go ahead.
President of the Republic of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa: Thank you very much, President Assoumani. And greetings once again to you, President Putin, and, indeed, to my other brothers who have joined us. We are delighted that we have been joined by President Museveni, President Sassou Nguesso and President Sisi, who could not join us when we last came here.
So, our team is now enhanced and we are pleased that we could have this engagement with yourself and thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us. We also wish to thank you for giving us an outline of the issues as you have done, which you did when we met you a few weeks ago when we came to St Petersburg.
We have often said that, having come here from meeting President Zelensky, we are, in our view, the only group that is able to talk to both sides. You yourself attested to that.
We are pleased that we can have access to you and have a follow-up discussion as you promised that we would have on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa summit. So, we are really delighted.
As you heard the various inputs by various leaders during the Russia-Africa summit plenary sessions, all of Africa would like to see peace prevailing, we are all in support of peace. And in many ways our coming here also testifies to that.
Of course, in addition, we, collectively as African countries, have a very collaborative relationship with Russia. We cooperate in a number of areas and this gives us the ability to talk to you about peace because as much as we are having challenges on the African continent, with Niger now being subjected to a coup, and a few other countries, as the African Union and indeed as African countries we stand on the side of peace.
And even in this case with the conflict in Ukraine, we still advocate for peace, and, in a way, we feel that we have a right to call for peace, because the ongoing conflict, as you heard during the course of the day, also negatively affects us as African countries. Apart from the fact that we want to support the peace process all over the world, this conflict is now directly affecting us as well, as we told you last time, as far as food security is concerned.
The prices of our fertilisers have gone up, the cost of living in many of our countries has gone up and we do believe that that is in the interest of humanity and the people, yes, of Russia and Ukraine that there should be peace and that this conflict should be settled in a peaceful manner.
We do understand from your explanation the origins of this conflict and where it started and how it started. We are, however, pleased to hear you say that you recognise the initiative that we as African countries – seven African countries – have taken. And you take this initiative by the seven countries very seriously, and you have given due consideration and regard to the proposals that we put forward.
You will recall that we said we would like engagement, that there should be engagement. In calling for engagement we say so from our own history as African countries. Many countries on the continent were involved in various conflicts and in the end, those conflicts, many of them, were resolved through peaceful means, through negotiations.
It is this that informs us to call for negotiations and dialogue. And, in that regard, we do believe that we have a right to call for peace because that is a principle that we firmly believe in.
We did inform you the moment that we met you that we as African countries stand firm on the respect for the United Nations Charter and principles, which we also have adopted as the African Union. We believe that those principles should be respected and we are pleased to hear you say exactly the same thing.
We are pleased to hear you also say that our ideas resonate with your ideas and they also coincide with the ideas that have been put forward by others and principally China. When we met with you, we said that our initiative should not ever be seen as replacing other initiatives. It should be seen as complimenting the efforts and the initiatives that others have embarked upon. Therefore, as we speak, we speak in support of various other proposals.
President Putin, we are pleased tonight that you will be able to give us an indication of your response to a number of proposals that were put forward, in the closed session, that is. And what pleases us is that you yourself have said that you have been giving serious consideration to the proposals that have been put forward by the seven African countries.
So, I draw a lot of confidence from what you have said and that in the closed session you will be able to inform us. Yes, you are absolutely right in saying that a number of us have taken various positions with regard to this conflict. But the main and key positions that all of us have taken is that this conflict should be resolved through negotiations, through dialogue, and we agree with you that that is the best way to go.
In this regard, as African countries, we want to play a constructive role, we want to see how best we can assist in ensuring that there is dialogue and that this conflict should be brought to an end.
As we said right from the onset and as we listened to you today, you responded to some of the issues that were in our proposals and one of those was about the grain. We proposed that we would like the Black Sea Initiative to be implemented and that the Black Sea should be open and, in that regard, we were saying – so that we are understood – we were saying we would like the Black Sea to be open to the world market.
We are not here to plead for donations for the African continent. We do recognise that out of generosity, out of the heart of the Russian Federation, you have decided to donate grain to a number of countries on the continent that are facing challenges.
We respect that and we accept that, but our main input here is not so much focused on the issue of giving and donating grain to the African continent, but we accept what you have decided in that regard.
So, we are here, President Putin, to listen to you, to hear what your response would be to some of the proposals and, as we said, we are prepared to engage further. Today we are very pleased that there are six of us here, although President Hichilema could not travel, but at the same time he is also well represented by our presence here.
So, thank you very much and I am sure that we will be able to hear your response to a number of those issues in the closed session. Thank you very much.

Russian President Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends.
I am happy to meet with you again and to have the opportunity to compare notes on current issues. Russia and Eritrea maintain friendly relations that continue to develop on the principles of equality and mutual respect; last May we marked the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations.
A couple of months ago you visited Russia and we held in-depth talks, and discussed promising areas for cooperation between our countries, mapping out concrete steps to develop them.

On my instruction, an ad hoc high-level inter-departmental working group was set up, and it will be led by my aide, Mr Maxim Oreshkin, who will be looking into opportunities to boost trade and step up economic cooperation between our countries. We are looking forward to the appointment of a coordinator of all these issues representing your country.
I expect our meeting today and your participation in today’s all-African discussion – its outcome, at least – to contribute to strengthening relations between Russia and Eritrea.
I am very happy to see you and, once again, welcome.
President of Eritrea Isaias Afwerki: I have been patiently listening to people talking at these meetings and there is one issue that worries me. I just want to articulate that issue and tell you our views, at least how we see the situation from our perspective.
When people talk about Russia and Ukraine, I say that there is no Russia-Ukraine war at all, there is no Russia-Ukraine conflict. This is a war that was declared by NATO on Russia. The war declared by NATO on Russia is not only against Russia; its aim is to dominate the whole world.
This is an agenda they developed after the end of the Cold War. They came up with this fantasy about containing Russia, containing any power – small or big – that challenges them technologically, economically, socially, culturally. They have to contain everybody.
This is a defunct ideology. I say Russia did not prepare to face this declared war, even though Russia was aware of the dynamics of what was going on. NATO is defunct. NATO does not exist. NATO is in intensive care. The EU does not exist. The EU is in intensive care. Thirty years ago, when they decided to contain Russia, they felt that it was a major threat for them.
China was not considered a threat at that time. Now they know that they missed the point. They could not contain Russia. They will never contain Russia. Ukraine is a sacrifice. Ukraine is a price they have to pay. They are not paying on their own: they will provide billions and billions even trillions to continue this war.
Now we need to look at the narrative thread: this is not a war between Russia and Ukraine; this is a declared war against Russia because Russia was a major threat to them. Now they have to defeat Russia so that they hegemonise everything.
They need to be your equals technologically, militarily, they have to be superior economically, they have to control everything, grab every resource here and there, and get technology under their control. That dream is no more.
The fighting going on in Ukraine is their battleground. That battleground is a sacrifice for them. We need to put this thread on the record, when a big meeting like this Russia-Africa summit is held, people will have to come to a consensus – this is not a war between Russia and Ukraine to me, and anyone who has a different explanation will have to tell me.
This is a war declared on Russia but a war declared to achieve hegemony. In the last 30 years I have seen the details of the mechanism of this declared war; this last event is the final phase to me. It will end sometime. NATO will not get out of intensive care. The EU will not get out of intensive care. These systems are crumbling. It is only a matter of time.
The whole world will have to be prepared not to defend Russia but to stand with Russia so that this hegemonistic ideology does not prevail at any point in history.
How do we design a plan? How do we make their plan fail without any further cost? They are printing money. They are not manufacturing anything at all; it is all about printing money. And this is one of their weapons. The global monetary system controlled by the dollar and the euro is being used. They are introducing sanctions and freezing accounts ­– these are their tools. This is not going to continue indefinitely.
We need a new financial architecture, globally, one that is not controlled by the euro, the dollar or other currencies. Following this failed attempt to contain Russia they will immediately move to the East: containing China is their next agenda. They are playing a very deceptive tactic, telling everyone: “Oh, no, we have to work with China, we have to do this and that.”
Their calculation about China has proved to be wrong. They have failed: they probably have the technology, they have everything, the Chinese can only copy those things, but they will never equal them. So, they will contain Russia while promoting friendship with China and continuing to use it so that containing Russia would be easier for them.
Now China is out of control. Containing China from Taiwan, from India, from Japan, from the South Kurils, from Australia – how do they do it, how will they do it? That challenge is coming next, but first they need to deal with Russia. How do they want to deal with Russia and then move on to China? How can they deal with everybody? How do they contain us?
Imagine, this time Eritrea is being contained by them. We are being punished with their sanctions all the time. We have to be punished because we are not bowing to their conditionalities. We are a very small threat; we are not even a threat to them. But they have to contain us: sanctions, sanctions, sanctions, conflict here, conflict there.
I think we need to strategise and I say Russia will have to lead this strategy. Russia will have to design a plan on facing this declared war, not only on Russia, but this is a global war. Everybody should come and join Russia in this strategy, and the sooner, the better. The easiest way for us to control their hegemonistic strategy and frustrate that strategy is to have peace, and then development will come.
Nobody is going to bother us, nobody is going to bully anybody. They are using defamation, demonisation, psychological warfare, sanctions. We will need an alternative strategy to deal with this hegemonistic declaration of war. And every event – bilateral or multilateral – will have to adopt this strategy, and that is why I say during my remarks that Russia should design a strategy.
It is not because Russia will have to do everything; we can make our contribution. It is a matter of ideas: how do we face this hegemonistic strategy in a way that we are able implement bilateral programmes, technology, industrialisation, agriculture, energy, water management, services, tourism, life in general – how do we do that?
Now, we have to look at this in the historical context. This is a continuation of classical slavery. After slavery came colonialism. Slavery was exterminating populations. Nine million people were exterminated in the Congo, Indians were exterminated in North America and in Canada. They were exterminating indigenous populations and grabbing control of their land.
And when they got control of the land, they had to bring slaves from Africa for their cotton plantations in the United States. That was slavery, and it continues. Then the industrialisation came. That was a matter of grabbing other countries’ resources and the continuation of slavery. Then a different form – colonialism – came: they colonised territories so that they could grab control of the land, and then they controlled labour and enslaved everybody.
Then there was neo-colonialism and the Cold War. Russia was the hope of the people of the world during the period of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, leaders in the Soviet Union made mistakes that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was a historic tragedy, as you said at one point. That was a historic tragedy: in the course of the history of humanity that was a catastrophe.
That was one of the reasons that encouraged people like Fukuyama and Huntington to design their strategy of hegemony. Because the Soviet Union collapsed, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and they felt that they could control the world for the coming 50 or 100 years without anyone challenging them.
That was when this hegemonistic fantasy emerged. We have seen what they have done over the last 30 years. It is a continuation of the same ideology of slavery, colonialism, neo-colonialism, and then hegemony.
The world will have to overcome this state of affairs. We are at a crossroads. We believe we are in transition to a new world order. How do we design a new world order? How can we possibly strategise, how do we use the resources, how do we make people everywhere aware that this threat exists. And if they get out of this situation, they can enjoy their liberty, their freedom, their development without this hegemonistic idea.
I think this issue will have to be thoroughly addressed and we need to come up with concrete plans. We will make our modest contribution, but we have the understanding that this Russia-Africa partnership is one part of the bigger global partnership that we will have to develop.
Russia will have to take the lead, because Russia has been targeted and is still being targeted. They might dream of using the war in Ukraine now to weaken Russia and they probably dream about the same event happening. The collapse of Russia will be a big advantage for them. It is a dream. They are now spending trillions and trillions by printing money to run the show in Ukraine. This will have to end at some point.
We need to look beyond that. Our bilateral partnership is based on our understanding of this historic mission of Russia. Russia has a historic mission to play. On behalf of everybody in the world I can say who is the leader of this show – Mr Vladimir Putin is the leader of the show. Russia should take the lead because of the challenge that we are facing.
I am not flattering anyone. I am not doing any favour to you. I say this is a global challenge and we have to overcome it by identifying the role of each and every one of us in the whole story.
Economic programmes, energy, water, infrastructure – you name it. Everyone will have a strategy and will define their goals and objectives. Once we have a strategy in place, we will draw detailed plans on each and every sector, each and every industry. We will mobilise the resources for implementing those programmes and we will see that implementing them will change people’s lives in Africa, Asia, Latin America, even Europe and the United States also.
Our detailed plans for sectoral programmes are ready: on each and every sector we have our own strategic plan. We have considered the details of each and every item of an infrastructure programme: roads, ports, airports, railway, energy programmes, water preservation and water management programmes, irrigation, introducing technologies, and our human resource development strategies. We discussed it yesterday with one of your ministers. We agreed on the details of how we will go about this because the development of our human resources is a priority for us. There could be other resources: oil, gas, minerals, and so on. But human resources are our human capital. We need to invest in that and we can rely on the Russian Federation to help develop our capacity to implement developmental programmes by guaranteeing the qualified human resources that we need. The details are there.
Do we have the money? We will try to mobilise every single penny, and if we cannot mobilise this resource, we will say to our partners in the Russian Federation: “These are our plans and if you have an idea or an opinion, or alternatives we would like to listen.”
Mobilising resources is a shared responsibility and we can mobilise our own resources from whatever is available: mining, agriculture, manufacturing. We can do that.
Thank you for your patience.
