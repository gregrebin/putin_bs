President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon, veterans and friends,
I was watching the newsreels from November 7, 1941 just before and thinking about the fact that although victory is not won at parades of course, that particular parade did have tremendous symbolic importance. In extremely tough conditions and at a time when Moscow was essentially under siege and the enemy was at the approaches to the city, the decision was made to hold this parade to show the Red Army and Soviet people’s strength of spirit. Although it was only the very start of our country’s liberation and the battles of Kursk, Stalingrad, and numerous other battles in the history of the Great Patriotic War were still to come, that parade on November 7, 1941 had absolutely vital importance. 
It was this event that sent our country the signal that we could overcome even the greatest difficulties, and that even the most audacious enemy, who insolently planned to hold their own parade in our capital on that date, stood no chances. I want to thank you from all my heart, thank the veterans for all that you did, thank you for that immortal act and the spirit our people showed in the battle for Moscow and the other battles that took place. I want to thank you for all of the immense work that you have done and continue to do today.
I met just before with a smaller group of your comrades and said to them, “We hope very much that you will continue the great moral work you are doing amongst our young people, continue telling them about our people’s heroic acts and about that to which you have devoted your entire lives.” I think this an exceptionally important mission and I want to thank you most sincerely for it.
You can be sure that the state authorities will do everything to ensure that you have the decent lives and support and protection you deserve today. We have the political will and the necessary budget funds to do this.
I wish you good health and once more, want to say thank you for everything you have done for our great country.
