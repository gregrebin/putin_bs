Meeting with President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev
May 22, 2018
During our conversation, which was very detailed both in the restricted and expanded formats, I informed Mr President about our priorities in building bilateral relations and Russia’s approaches to a number of international issues.
I think Mr President’s visit is a good signal for resuming full-fledged Russian-Bulgarian relations.
Thank you for your attention.
President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev
(retranslated): Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation. The goal of our visit is to try to resume the top-level dialogue between our countries.
Restoring trust will be very difficult, because we will have to do this after three major projects that were suspended because of confrontation between the European Union and NATO on the one hand and Russia on the other hand, in conditions of sanctions and restrictions.
However, we have made the first step towards this. President Putin and I have conducted a strategic review of relations between our countries and identified the traditions and the huge potential of our countries in trade, energy, tourism, cultural development and transport.
This will be a positive impetus for the Bulgarian Government, for taking a realistic stand and assuming a responsible attitude to the development of relations between our countries. This impetus will be taken up by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who plans to visit Russia soon.
With President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev.
We also discussed international security issues of mutual concern. Bulgaria will do its best to promote dialogue and mutual understanding between our countries, because nobody wants to go back in the past and see a cold war between Russia and the EU. Therefore, we will work on this positive impetus in all spheres of our relations.
There is still much we must do on the issues where we have problems and differences. I would like to repeat my invitation to President Putin to visit Bulgaria in this year of the 140th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation and victory in the Russo-Turkish War.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues. I am happy to see you in Russia. Welcome.
You have come here on the occasion of the 140th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation from the Ottoman rule, which is a major landmark in our common history.
This is not all. We have many more things in common. The day after tomorrow we will mark the Day of Slavic Writing and Culture. I know that you have attended several cultural events in Moscow. This autumn, Russian cultural events will be held in connection with this date in Bulgaria. Days of Russian Spiritual Culture were held in Bulgaria recently on the occasion of the 140th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation.
With President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev.
I will not speak in detail about our economic cooperation. I will only say that bilateral trade increased last year, which is good news. But our potential is larger than what we have been doing so far and what we have achieved.
In a few days, we will have the pleasure of welcoming the Prime Minister of Bulgaria to Moscow, with whom we will continue this discussion.
Once again, welcome.
President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev
(retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much for your invitation.
I would like to congratulate you on your election for the next presidential term and to wish you success in this responsible position.
The goal of my visit is to try to resume the top-level dialogue between our countries, which has been suspended for years. This dialogue is of crucial significance in all spheres of mutual interest.
Also, I am glad that my visit is taking place on the eve of the Day of Slavic Writing and Culture, which we mark on May 24. I am happy that our people are celebrating this festival together now.
We will also celebrate together one more emblematic holiday, the 140th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation and victory in the Russo-Turkish War, thanks to which Bulgaria has reappeared on the map of Europe. This is why our relations are so special. They are not based on purely political or economic interests, but on very deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties between our people, ties that go back centuries. This gives us a number of advantages and makes our relations more natural. At the same time, this also forces us to be more open and to openly discuss the issues on which we differ.
Meeting with President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev.
I would like to conduct a strategic review of our bilateral relations today. We must not only talk about our strong traditions and huge potential, which does exist, but also substantiate the need for practical action. We have very many common interests in trade, the economy, education and culture, as you have said.
I hope that today we will hold an open and in-depth dialogue that will encourage our governments to keep working towards this.
Once again, thank you for inviting us.
