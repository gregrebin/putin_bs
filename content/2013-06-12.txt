Candidate cities to host the Expo 2020 universal exhibition are presenting their bids today at the International Exhibitions Bureau (BIE) General Assembly in Paris. The bidding cities are Yekaterinburg (Russia), Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Izmir (Turkey) and Ayutthaya (Thailand).
Russia is represented at the Paris General Assembly by Deputy Prime Minister and Head of the Yekaterinburg Expo 2020 Bid Organising Committee Arkady Dvorkovich, Governor of Sverdlovsk Region Yevgeny Kuivashev, and CEO of the Expo 2020 Bid Committee Erik Bugulov. 
In accordance with BIE requirements, videos presenting the candidate cities’ advantages and possibilities are the main component of the bid presentations. One of the central components of the Russian presentation details the state support for Yekaterinburg’s bid and includes a video address in English by Mr Putin.
President Putin examined Yekaterinburg’s Expo 2020 venue model together with President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy and President of the European Commission Jose Manual Barroso at the Russia-EU summit in Yekaterinburg on June 4, 2013.
The Expo 2020 host city will be chosen in a final vote by the BIE General Assembly in Paris in November 2013.

Presentation of Yekaterinburg’s Expo 2020 venue model
June 4, 2013
Russia has a long and rich experience of participation in the World Expo movement. We took part in the very first universal exhibition in London in 1851. And at the Paris exhibition in 1900 our pavilion won the coveted Gold Medal and Grand Prix. But in all this time, Russia has not hosted the World Expo, not once. Surely, time has come to change this.
So, we proudly submit our bid to host World Expo 2020 in Yekaterinburg – a dynamic and promising city.
Our bid’s organising committee has the full backing of the Russian government. We guarantee: it will be a priority national project. We are going to build a massive state-of-the-art complex with the capacity to host 30 million visitors over the course of the event. We plan to allocate all the necessary funding for its construction.
I am confident: we shall welcome guests from 150 nations of the world with pride and dignity.
Now, once again I would like to make this very clear: Russia guarantees to fulfil the complete range of requirements set by the International Exhibitions Bureau. In particular, we are preparing a special programme of support for developing countries. This will enable around ninety countries to freely participate in the Expo, completely free of charge.
I can assure you that our grand-scale plans for 2020 will be delivered if Yekaterinburg is given the honour to host World Expo 2020.
Thank you for your attention, and I hope for your support.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, I congratulate you on Russia Day.
This holiday grows in importance every year. Its meaning, spirit and atmosphere reflect Russia’s development today. It is also a part of our history with all its difficult and sometimes dramatic moments.
We all remember how sudden and dramatic the changes of the early 1990s were, the transition to a new life, how difficult it all was, and how great the political and economic transformations taking place were. The Russian people’s will, strength, and patience helped us to get through the hardships of those years and ultimately reach civil, social and ethnic peace and set our country firmly on a development track that is inseparable from the ideas of democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law.
These values are of paramount importance for us. Moreover, the energy of a united society and the freedom and responsibility of each individual citizen are a powerful force for taking us forward and guaranteeing the success of our bold and ambitious projects.
Friends, today’s holiday symbolises the common destiny of our people, who have lived in peace and harmony for centuries, and sincerely love their homeland, which is the common home for people of different ethnic groups and faiths.
We must always remember the importance and wealth of this unique experience, treasure the traditions that our forebears have handed down through the ages, and be worthy of their sacred love for their fatherland, their deeds and sacrifices. This is our priceless heritage and the foundation for strengthening our unity and for our moral and spiritual development.
Each generation has a duty to make their contribution to their great country’s history. We must do all we can to reach our goals, above all that of giving our millions of people a better quality of life. Our country’s democratic procedures, federal system, market economy and all forms of guarantees for human rights must work towards this priority goal today. Change makes sense when people actually see that their lives are getting better. These are the goals we will achieve.
Friends, once again I congratulate you on this holiday and raise a toast to a free and prosperous Russia and to prosperity for our people!
Happy Russia Day!
