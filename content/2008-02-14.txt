President Vladimir Putin: Mr Minister, I wish you a warm welcome to Moscow. I would like to ask you to pass on my gratitude to the King of Saudi Arabia and Guardian of the two Holy Places for the constant attention he pays to developing our bilateral relations.
I had the opportunity to receive the Crown Prince just recently. Overall, we see that our bilateral relations are developing well.
I would like to confirm from the outset that we support, and I personally support, Saudi Arabiaâ€™s proposal to sign an intergovernmental agreement on developing our relations. I hope that your dialogue with your Russian counterpart on bilateral relations and on the situation in the region will be productive.
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saud Al Faisal: First of all, I would like to thank Your Excellency for finding time in your busy schedule to meet with me.
I pass on warm greetings from King Abdullah, the Guardian of the two Holy Places of Islam, and I can confirm that he is committed to all-round development of our relations in order to establish strategic ties between our countries in all areas.
I am pleased to say that the meetings between our countries at various levels rest on a solid foundation. We hope that the current level of trust and cooperation that exists between our countries will be maintained in the future.
