Speech at the Main Naval Parade
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade sailors, midshipmen, petty officers, officers and admirals,
Dear veterans,
My congratulations on Navy Day!
This holiday is celebrated in each Russian region and with special solemnity, at the bases and in the garrisons of the Northern, Pacific, Baltic, Black Sea fleets and the Caspian Flotilla.
Russia’s history is inseparable from the victories of its courageous and fearless Navy. Our country’s status as a strong marine power has been achieved through the brave acts of sailors and officers, the inventive talent of our shipbuilders and the daring exploits of sea explorers.
Throughout the centuries, the fortitude and tenacity of Russian sailors was tempered in battles. Both on land and at sea, they mastered their military skills, strengthened the traditions of their unique naval brotherhood.
During the Great Patriotic War the Navy fought to the bitter end on the coasts and sea borders of our native lands. The Battles of Odessa and Sevastopol, heroic deeds of the Northern Sea Fleet sailors, legendary raids by Soviet submarines, the defence of Leningrad and the impregnable Kronstadt have been forever enshrined in the chronicles of history.
The Navy and commitment to Fatherland are inseparable. As Admiral Nakhimov used to say, a sailor has neither an easy nor difficult path, but rather a glorious one.
And everyone currently serving, in our ground forces and submarines, in the marine air force, in the coastal defence, and those who work in the shipbuilding industry, all are faithful to these vows. Their high moral and professional qualities have been and will remain the foundation of successful service in the Navy, and the state will offer its full support.
Much is being done today for the development and renovation of the Navy. New ships are being commissioned, the fleet’s combat training and readiness are being perfected.
Seamanship is chosen by the vigorous and strong-willed, by those who dare to defy the elements, who cannot imagine themselves without the sea, without difficult and noble service to their Fatherland.
Friends,
Today the Navy is not only solving its traditional tasks but is also nobly responding to new challenges, making a significant contribution to the fight against terrorism and piracy.
The children and grandchildren of today’s sailors will take pride in their forefathers. Of this I am certain. Because your exemplary training, promptness and discipline are borne out during both training exercises and combat operations.
I want to express gratitude to those who wait for you in your homes and keep you warm with their love.
Thank you for your readiness and your ability to solve the most complicated tasks, for your worthy service and your unwavering allegiance to our Motherland and to our people.
Glory to the Navy!
Happy holiday!
Hurray!
