Speech at round table of Energy Club Summit: Reshaping Global Oil Markets
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends and colleagues,
I am very happy to welcome you to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Without a doubt, energy has always been one of the key strategic sectors in the world economy and very much remains so today.
If we look at the global landscape of the energy sector overall, we can see noticeable, I would even say momentous changes. The demand for oil and gas has risen – in China alone, oil consumption has increased by 30 percent in the last five years. The role of gas is also growing, including shale gas.
The “oil track” has new extraction technologies that are greatly expanding the volume of accessible reserves of this highly important energy resource, and this increase in supply means greater competition among producers. The structure and geography of supply streams is changing. All this is noticeably transforming the configuration of the global markets.
Overall, it is clear that the situation in global energy is a true challenge for all of us, first and foremost for you – those who are working in this sector – and we must rise to this challenge. We can do this most efficiently if we combine our efforts.
As you know, Russia is one of the world leaders in gas, oil and petroleum product exports, and contributes significantly to ensuring global and regional energy security. We value our deserved reputation as a trustworthy and responsible partner in energy resource markets.
Today, our fuel and energy industry is entering a new stage in its evolution, due to the development of new types of resources – continental shelf reserves, high viscosity oils and shale oils, and extraction at polar latitudes.
”Russia is one of the world leaders in gas, oil and petroleum product exports, and contributes significantly to ensuring global and regional energy security. We value our deserved reputation as a trustworthy and responsible partner in energy resource markets.“
The sector’s development is also tied to new projects in Russia’s Far East and in the Arctic. The volume of new resources is very high – I would even say colossal: Bazhenovskaya Suite alone has around 22 billion tonnes.
In recent months, we have done a great deal of work: measures have been proposed to provide tax incentives for developing tight oil reserves and a new taxation system for projects on the continental shelf. But the difficulty and importance of resolving these challenges require coordinated actions, cooperation between producers, reciprocal steps pertaining to exchanging assets, jointly implementing projects, localising and licensing technologies. This is precisely the policy we intend to follow in Russia.
The first steps in this direction are already being taken. Rosneft and ExxonMobil have created a research and development centre for Arctic technologies. I will take this opportunity to also congratulate the winners of the Global Energy Prize awarded today. This year, it was awarded to Japanese scientist Akira Yoshino and Russian researcher Vladimir Fortov. I must note that basic research in the field of energy is what lays the foundation for the future of energy security in our nation and the world overall.
Today, several new documents were signed at this forum on partnerships between Rosneft and international oil and gas companies ExxonMobil, Statoil and Eni (I am happy to see our old friends here today and to greet them), as well as an agreement on technological partnership with General Electric and agreements on the principles of supplying LNG.
This is basically a new era in cooperation the essence of which, as regards our interaction with strategic partners, is to move away from just importing raw materials to establishing full-fledged cooperation in production and technology.
The effects of the financial crisis led to a change in the global economic map: there are new points of growth. I think this has been most true in the Asia-Pacific region in recent and will continue to be so in upcoming years. However, this also increasingly applies to the Russian Federation’s domestic market. For our oil and gas companies, domestic market is already comparing to export supplies. I am confident the companies which are investing in expanding domestic production in Russia will secure for their business significant growth for many decades to come.
”Recently, we have observed an increase in global competition in energy. I believe that in these conditions, we should all strive to reduce the level of politics involved in energy supplies and allow market participants themselves to choose business partners.“
Recently, we have observed an increase in global competition in energy. This can be seen clearly at the corporate level as well: a new wave of mergers and acquisitions, as well as the emergence of new leaders, is underway all over the world. I believe that in these conditions, we should all strive to reduce the level of politics involved in energy supplies and allow market participants themselves to choose business partners. The goal of the nations’ leadership is to promote all the necessary conditions for this kind of process.
This year, an important event happened in Russia’s oil sector: Rosneft oil company acquired from Russian investors and British Petroleum 100% of their stake in TNK-BP. In turn, BP increased its share of Rosneft to 19.75 percent. I believe that this mutually beneficial swap of assets in the fuel and energy industry is a good foundation for moving forward.
At the same time, we should not underestimate regulation factors in both energy and related markets. Their steady development will be directly dependent on pricing transparency, effective monetary policy and harmonising the tax environment, all in a wide range of regions and countries around the world. Most of the biggest projects in energy may take decades and are highly capital-intensive, which requires predictable business conditions.
The issue of coordination in energy is up in the air, if you will. However, no established idea for creating a coordinating authority on a global platform currently exists. So it seems we ought to get started on this work. We could possibly set a council or a forum that would bring together interests-based working groups or sections of, for example, consumers, producers, infrastructure operators, regulators and so on. Such a forum or council could engage in overall coordination. We will suggest that our G20 partners consider how it could be organised.
Friends, colleagues, I would like to conclude my speech on a positive note: I want to present Russian Federation state awards to the CEOs of several leading global energy companies. I want to once again congratulate our colleagues and thank them for the great input they are making to developing energy sector, strengthening international cooperation in this highly important area; it is no exaggeration to say that its steady development plays a significant role in general progress and directly affects the wellbeing of our planet’s peoples.
I want to thank you for your cooperation with your Russian partners. I wish all of you, your colleagues and your companies that are operating in Russia new successes.
Thank you for your attention.

Beginning of meeting with Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam Federal Chancellor, colleagues and friends, I wish you all a warm welcome to St Petersburg.
I am very happy that we are continuing our dialogue at the highest level and that we are doing so on a regular basis. Thank you for finding the time to come to St Petersburg for this economic forum.
I think you have had the chance to see that this is not time lost, as there are many interesting and useful people to meet here, many interesting ideas, and it is a good platform for exchanging views. Given the extent of our cooperation, we need this kind of intensive dialogue.
Thank you very much.
Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel (translated from Russian): I for my part would like to thank you for this meeting too. 
This is the second time we are meeting this week. We agreed at the Hannover Trade Fair that I would come to the forum in St Petersburg, and I think this is all the more important this year, with Russia holding the G20 presidency.
We will continue our political dialogue here, and later we will also meet with German business leaders.
Once again, I thank you. Thank you very much.

Answers to questions from St Petersburg International Economic Forum participants
June 21, 2013
17:30
St Petersburg
Moderator (retranslated): Mr President, the St Petersburg International Economic Forum is being held in your hometown. I would like to ask the following question. You spoke at the G8 summit and also chaired a meeting of Business 20 in St Petersburg. Currently, there is a lot of talk about the EU-US trade alliance and about offshore taxation; there are also disagreements on Syria.
Ultimately, what will be your top priority for the G20 meeting in September? After all, there was no discussion about stimulating global growth. Are the G20’s priorities changing? Or do you mean some other priority? What issue is most important for you at the G20?
Vladimir Putin: I think Madame Federal Chancellor will confirm that during the G8 summit in the United Kingdom, we also discussed the two areas pertaining to the continuity of our work.
The first is continuing what our Mexican friends and partners achieved at the G20 summit in Los Cabos. After our meeting in the United Kingdom, we focused our attention on several aspects of developing the global economy, and one way or another, they will also be reflected in the agenda for the upcoming G20 summit in St Petersburg this September.
What did we discuss there? We talked about creating the best conditions for developing the global economy. What are they? They include taxation, which I spoke about today; they also include the fight against the global economy offshoring.
As we know, these were among the negative components that led to the financial and economic crises of 2008–2009. We talked about the need to do everything we can together to broaden the horizons for trade, in the sense that global trade has shrunk somewhat in the last year. We talked about harmonising positions on these and several other fundamental aspects of global economic development.
Naturally, we discussed the situation in each of our nations – in the United States, in Europe, in Russia. Each of the G8 leaders talked about what their administrations are doing domestically.
President Obama talked about how he is improving tax legislation with regard to threats stemming from offshoring. All this was a natural common area for joint work and discussing critical problems of mutual interest.
”Only the Syrian people themselves can guarantee a long-term solution to all the problems that have accumulated there over many decades. And coming from the outside, we can only create the conditions for achieving these agreements.“
As for foreign policy issues such as Syria, there were other problems discussed as well, but I think Syria is the most pressing issue today, and this was an entirely open and engaged discussion. We once again confirmed our main joint concern and objective (indeed, it is reflected in the final declaration): ending violence as quickly as possible, creating conditions for renewing political dialogue between all opposing parties, bringing the two sides which are currently actively engaged in hostilities, including with the use of arms, to the negotiating table, agreeing to convoke the Geneva-2 conference as quickly as possible which will be based on the principles of the previous Geneva meeting, and impelling the conflicting sides to engage in dialogue and reach positive results.
Overall, I want to stress that the discussion on this issue, as well as other issues, was engaged and oriented toward partnership. Different participants in our discussion expressed differing opinions. But what made me happy was that in spite of the depth and difficulty of the problems under discussion, we always sought a way to find compromises, and were able to reach consensus on nearly every issue.
* * *
Moderator: Mr President, I wanted to ask foreign policy questions a little later, but since you mentioned Syria, I want to ask the following.
Discussions will be held at Geneva-2, but Russia is currently providing arms to Assad’s regime. The United States chose the other side. And so, there are disagreements within the G8 on how to proceed tactically. Can Geneva-2 be held given these disagreements? One side is receiving arms from both you and Iran. The United States is taking the other position. What do you think about this?
Vladimir Putin: As far as arms deliveries are concerned, I already spoke about this at the press conference in the United Kingdom. I can simply repeat that the Russian Federation is not violating a single international principle of law. Russia is supplying arms to the incumbent and legitimate government of the Syrian Republic in line with international law, under open and transparent contacts.
As for the opposing side, let me draw your attention to the fact that it has been receiving arms from abroad for a long time. And we are not going to talk now about the origin of these types of arms. But it is clear that without supplies from abroad, the events happening today in Syria would simply not be possible. Money and arms are being channelled in, as are well-trained armed units, largely from foreign nations – not just from abroad, but mostly.
Meanwhile, in Europe and the international arena, within the UN framework, resolutions have been adopted establishing an arms embargo against non-governmental groups, particularly in the conflict zone. In this regard, there really are certain disagreements in the stances between, for example, ourselves and the United States. But I can tell you, it’s not just between Russia and the United States. The US and Russia are not alone in holding a position on this.
I want to assure you that all the G8 participants are self-sufficient states and their leaders are self-sufficient, world-class public officials. Each has their own opinion regarding the current problems not just in Syria but in other regions of the world as well. And when someone supposes that Russia is on one side and the US is on the other, this is inaccurate; it is a simplistic view of complicated global processes.
Basically, I can once again confirm what I said in the United Kingdom: it is hard for me to imagine why anyone would supply arms to those armed opposition groups in Syria, whose composition is not fully clear to us. If the United States and the US Secretary of State recognise one of the key Syrian opposition organisations, Jabjat al-Nusra, as a terrorist group and officially recognise its connection to Al-Qaeda, how can they supply arms to that opposition? Where will these arms eventually end up? What will be their role?
It is known that there are at least 600 individuals from Russia and Europe currently fighting with the opposition. Where do those arms go? We still do not have answers to these questions. And when we ask our partners these questions, they also cannot answer. So things are not as simple as you might like to imagine.
We feel that our position is justified and measured. We feel that only the Syrian people themselves can guarantee a long-term solution to all the problems that have accumulated there over many decades. And coming from the outside, we can only create the conditions for achieving these agreements.

Question (retranslated): We saw a very severe reaction after the US Federal Reserve made it clear that the bond purchasing policy may be adjusted by the end of 2013. There was a strong reaction in the markets all over the world, especially in emerging markets. What is the reaction of Russia and the new head of the Central Bank? What can Russia do to accelerate growth, especially given the concerns about the recent decision of the Federal Reserve?
”We must proceed from the fact that low-cost energy resources will not be available, and we must start extracting the hard-to-recover reserves, which requires large initial investment and new technologies. That would be a new step in the development of the energy sector.“
Vladimir Putin: In my address, I have already spoken about what Russia can and should do to increase growth, so I don’t think I should go over all of that again.
Regarding the response to Mr Bernanke’s announcement, I can say, first, that statements of this kind are to be expected because the adjustment has to be made at some point. It is impossible to endlessly pump up the economy with liquidity without addressing the underlying problems since the situation cannot be improved if they remain.
What President Obama has managed to achieve with the budget gap is very good, it is certainly in his favour in the domestic political line-up and competition, and it is an economic victory. But it is probably wrong when the whole world is holding its breath in anticipation of problems from one budget gap to another. Some fundamental decisions must be adopted, so it was clear that the Federal Reserve would make this adjustment. There is no surprise in it for us.
I think that this decision is a step in the right direction. We must gradually come out of the situation that was created over the past years. It is necessary to take steps to reduce the deficit of the US federal budget, to reduce debts and address many other problems.
President Obama spoke very openly about it at the G8 Summit. In general, I think this is a sensible decision. Don’t worry, the markets’ reaction is absolutely normal. I think that there will be adjustments, especially when the realisation comes that the recovery process has started in the US and global economies. This will benefit everyone in the end.
* * *
Vladimir Putin: If you don’t mind, I would like to come back to the first part. It’s not only the financial markets that were affected by Mr Bernanke’s announcement; the price of gold fell as well. Why did this happen? I think it happened because there are expectations of the dollar growing against the yuan, the euro and some other regional currencies. This will bring about a change in the commodities market. We just have to take this into account in our current economic policy.
The question you asked the Federal Chancellor [about the Eurozone’s approach to addressing unemployment in the southern countries and economic growth] is relevant not only for the Eurozone, but also for Russia. I said in my address that we must find a balance that combines our most effective measures to address strategic challenges and current issues. That is more or less the same as solving the unemployment problem in the Eurozone’s southern countries and achieving overall economic growth.
These are similar challenges, although I am happy to note that the situation in Russia is better at the moment: the unemployment rate is 5.5%. Can you imagine that? The unemployment rate is at the lowest point ever, just 5.5%. We have virtually no debts. The external debt of the Russian Federation is 2.5%. What is it in the United States? 114%, if I’m not mistaken, the Eurozone has just under 100%, and we have 2.5%. If you include the domestic debt, the figure will come to 10–11%.
Inflation is also nearly at the all time low, as I have already said, although it has gone up slightly. But I believe that the decision to slow down the growth of natural monopolies’ rates will deal a serious blow to inflation. Therefore, all the basic conditions for development are reasonable – I'm afraid to say good. But our problems are essentially comparable to the ones that the Federal Republic of Germany or other Eurozone countries have to address at the moment.
I agree with Madam Federal Chancellor, and she knows my position. I think our approach should be that before we invest something, put some honey or caviar in a barrel, we should first make sure that everything is in order, since these excellent goods are not going to disappear. You see, that's the most important thing. And in Russia there is also a lot of work to be done.

Question (retranslated): Major technological changes are taking place in the oil and gas industry: there are new types of oil and gas that affect the energy balance and potentially the price. How will these factors affect the Russian economy and what strategies does Russia have in mind to cope with this situation?
Vladimir Putin: Changes always occur and the world adapts to them somehow, and so does our economy. I don’t see any major changes. The fact that shale gas has appeared in the US market is a factor in today's economic life, particularly in the energy sector. But so far there have not been any fundamental changes. First, the cost of shale gas production is several times higher than conventional production.
Second, there are environmental factors. It is well known that in the areas where shale gas is extracted, the local residents get black slime flowing from their water taps. Also, such production requires the reservation of huge areas because the extraction is done by blowing up the deposits, one by one, further and further. Therefore, vast areas need to be withdrawn from economic circulation and suffer terrible damage.
I presume that the technology will improve, but at present the production of shale gas (which may be followed by shale oil, that is also possible, such production is also underway) gives the consumer the final price of $120 dollars per 1,000 cubic metres.
If we add to this the condensation, liquefaction and transportation, the price for the European market will be somewhere around $350–450 per 1,000 cubic metres. That is the same price at which Gazprom sells pipeline gas today to its major customers, including in Europe.
It may have certain advantages for the US market, at least today, but I don’t see any serious changes for the global gas energy market. This is one area we must tackle together, and I mentioned it in my meeting with the heads of energy companies: we must think about a fundamental change in technology in this area.
Now, if we manage to do this together, that will be a real breakthrough. We must proceed from the fact that low-cost energy resources will not be available, and we must start extracting the hard-to-recover reserves, which requires large initial investment and new technologies. That would be a new step in the development of the energy sector.
<…>
Question (translated from Russian): Russia has earned respect for its budget discipline over the last decade. Now that economic growth has slowed down, how do you plan to stimulate growth? What will you do to maintain the budget discipline that you put in place?
”It’s very important therefore that we be attentive and respectful towards each other. These are fundamental principles. Russia is always ready to listen to its partners, make adjustments if need be too, but only if you don’t come with a lecturing tone and try to dictate your rules.“
Vladimir Putin: I already spoke about this in my address. Let me just note a few points in particular. First, we want to make a substantial reduction in inflation and lay the fundamental conditions for economic growth.
Second, we will improve the banking system and, as we carry out this work, we will continue bringing down interest rates and making it easier for companies of all different sizes to get loans. 
We will lower administrative barriers, cut red tape, improve management quality, cut costs, and develop infrastructure.
The three projects I mentioned just before are only the tip of the iceberg. We will work in the Russian regions and in other areas. Of course this all requires resources. Let me say again that we will make the effort. These tasks might look to be mutually exclusive, but we will do our best to find a middle road that will let us maintain the fundamentals in place and at the same time give us the financing sources we need for carrying out other objectives, primarily the infrastructure projects I spoke about.
Finally, everyone is talking about investing in human capital today, improving education and healthcare. We have big programmes for working with the professionals and public groups in these fields too.
* * *
Question (translated from Russian): How can we go about actually implementing the four common spaces and free movement of goods? Is it possible to go back to 2005? Can we make the four common spaces reality for Russia and for the European Union?
Vladimir Putin: I don’t see why we need to go back to 2005. The Federal Chancellor hit the nail on the head when she spoke about Russia’s joining the WTO. When the two partners, Peter Mandelson and German Gref, settled all of those problems, the main aim was to ensure Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. This goal was accomplished.
There are still many problems and differences, and I think this is only natural really. Of course we need to continue at the same time to harmonise our general principles in the areas such as humanitarian law and our understanding of human rights, common values, and how we guarantee them. There are still a lot of things to work on together, come to understand each other.
It’s very important therefore that we be attentive and respectful towards each other. These are fundamental principles. Russia is always ready to listen to its partners, make adjustments if need be too, but only if you don’t come with a lecturing tone and try to dictate your rules.
For my part, I have not seen this kind of thing lately, and it would seem to be not going on. It’s one thing what the media says, you get emotional people there, not always so well informed about what is actually going on, and they have all kinds of different views and assumptions about events.
When you look at it, it is our officials and governments that are to blame really, because if we gave the public full and timely information about events there would be not all these various guesses and assumptions.
As for the actual substance of our economic cooperation, yes, there is a lot of debate here too, but this is only natural. Each side is always trying through the dialogue process to find the best solutions to their own problems. Sellers want a higher price, and buyers want to get things cheaper. This is only natural. There is nothing surprising in this situation. Certainly, we have our differences, but we are finding solutions.
Russia has joined the WTO. The head of another international organisation, the OECD, is here today, our good friend, and we are working with him on Russia’s accession to this organisation. We are not trying to hurry things and will proceed calmly in this work. We understand if it doesn’t all happen overnight, and we realise that we need to work on harmonising our internal rules and laws and bring them into line with the OECD. We are going about this calmly and steadily. I won’t even try to name any specific date for our accession. This is not really the most important thing. The important thing is that we understand each other, hear what each other is saying, and continue making progress on this road.
We have our differences with the European Union over the third energy package. We have not yet managed to reach an agreement on the principles yet. But as the Federal Chancellor noted too, we built Nord Stream together with our European partners and it is up and running now. I think that we will keep working in just this way because this is in our fundamental mutual interests.
I gave some figures for [energy resource] consumption growth in China. Demand is growing in Japan too, and in other parts of Asia, and demand will increase in Europe too. True, Europe is going through some difficult times right now, but I am confident that the European economy’s foundations and the responsible attitudes of European leaders will get this vital part of the global economy and Russia’s biggest trade partner back on its feet. Russia’s trade with the European Union comes to more than $400 billion. We therefore continue to work towards the goals that we set several years ago.

News conference with Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel
June 21, 2013

St Petersburg
2 of 5
During news conference with Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam Federal Chancellor, colleagues,
We have just had substantial and constructive talks, discussed key aspects of our bilateral cooperation, and gone over our positions on current issues. This is our second full-format meeting this week. We worked together at the G8 summit in Lough Erne a few days ago. This intensive political dialogue is evidence of the strategic character of relations between Russia and Germany.
Russia was the main partner country at the Hannover Messe 2013 in April, and we in turn invited the German Federal Chancellor to be the guest of honour at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.
Our relations in all different areas are developing rapidly. Our bilateral trade has reached a high level, with various estimates putting it at around $80 billion. The Federal Chancellor and I have set the goal of taking it even higher and aiming for, say, up to $100 billion. This will require initiative, good cooperation between our business circles, and new joint projects.
Following this news conference, the Federal Chancellor and I will meet with business leaders from both countries and discuss with them what we can do to further develop our cooperation, including in innovation fields. 
Germany is already one of our biggest investors, with around $25 billion accumulated investment in the Russian economy. More than 6,000 companies with German participation are successfully doing business in Russia today.
The energy sector has long been an important area for our bilateral cooperation. We celebrated 40 years since the start of Russian natural gas deliveries to Germany this June. Russia now accounts for around 45 percent of gas supplies to the German market, and 23 percent of oil supplies. Our countries are working together on big projects such as Nord Stream and South Stream. German companies are taking part in developing the Yuzhno-Russkoye field together with Gazprom and are working on other projects too.
”Our relations in all different areas are developing rapidly. Our bilateral trade has reached a high level, with various estimates putting it at around $80 billion.“
Russia and Germany both seek to develop closer industrial cooperation in sectors such as aircraft manufacturing, transport, energy machine-building, and pharmaceuticals. High speed trains are being manufactured at Russian enterprises based on Siemens’ standards. Volkswagen is building a new car engine assembly plant in Kaluga Region. Of course, there should be even more joint projects of this kind. 
We need German technology to help develop the Russian economy’s innovation sectors, modernise our transport and telecommunications infrastructures, and build social sector and sports facilities. This will offer potential contracts for German industry of course, and thus be a source of support and help to create jobs in Germany itself. Both countries understand that this kind of close cooperation will boost economic growth and help us to move faster. 
We also discussed the opportunities for expanding our cultural and humanitarian relations. We have been holding reciprocal cultural years in our two countries in 2012–2013, and have organised more than 300 different events as part of this project.
The Federal Chancellor and I will visit an exhibition at the Hermitage this evening, as we agreed, to see what our colleagues are doing in the cultural sphere and how our joint work is progressing in this area.
We discussed today the possibility of organising another big joint event in 2014 – the Year of Russian Language and Literature in Germany, and the Year of German Language and Literature in Russia.
We also discussed today Russia’s relations with the European Union. I will not repeat now all of the issues that we are trying to resolve at the moment, but there is progress on this track too.
I am sure that today’s talks will give impetus to continued progress in our bilateral cooperation.
Thank you very much for your attention.

Question: Mr President, could you say again about why the joint participation in the opening ceremony was cancelled at first? My second question is about Syria. You said at the plenary session that the West is supplying weapons to the rebels in Syria, but no one knows where those weapons are going to end up. You are supplying weapons to Assad, and we know exactly where those weapons are ending up. He is the man who has aimed weapons at his own people. Do you have any influence on Assad to help end this war? And can you imagine a government in Syria without Assad?
Vladimir Putin: Let's start with Syria, because the first question doesn’t exist. We didn’t cancel anything but we weren’t sure we would have enough time to visit the exhibition. Now that the Federal Chancellor and I looked at the timing, we realised that we would have enough time for a news conference and a meeting with the business community members, as well as a visit to the State Hermitage Museum. So this problem does not exist.
As for Syria and weapons supplies. I don’t know how many times I have repeated this and I can say it again: Russia is supplying weapons to a legitimate government in full compliance with the norms and principles of international law. Russia does not violate any of these rules. That is the first point.
Second. I can accept your thesis that Assad is using these weapons in the fight against his own people but with a big proviso because it is not the Syrian people that are fighting with Assad but the rebels, who are well-trained and well-armed, including by other countries and including through terrorist organisations.
A part of the so-called armed opposition, and a key part, the core of the opposition, is recognised by the international community as terrorists – I want you to give objective information to your audiences, the citizens of your countries. The well-known organisation called Al-Nusra is one of the centres of the armed opposition. The US State Department has listed it as a terrorist organisation with ties to Al-Qaeda.
”The energy sector has long been an important area for our bilateral cooperation. We celebrated 40 years since the start of Russian natural gas deliveries to Germany this June. Russia now accounts for around 45 percent of gas supplies to the German market.“
So who are you going to supply weapons to? We all know, and I mentioned this at a news conference in the UK, about the terrible tragedy, when a British serviceman was killed right in front of his barracks in London and was beheaded. That is just terrible. And those are the kind of people who are fighting with Assad. Should we supply weapons to them? That is what we are talking about here and that's what worries us.
Another point of concern for us is the possibility of a political vacuum, if decisions are taken regarding a change of government. I say this to you as frankly as I said in our discussions in the United Kingdom during the G8 Summit. Madam Federal Chancellor can confirm this.
Let’s say Assad leaves today – that gives rise to a political vacuum. Who will fill it? These terrorist organisations? Nobody wants that. How can this be avoided? After all, they are armed and aggressive. There is no answer to this question. So what shall we do? There is no answer to this question, either.
There is only one sensible idea, which was supported by everyone at the G8 Summit. Let me tell you about it again: the idea is to make all the parties to the conflict come to Geneva for the Geneva-2 talks, to sit down at the negotiating table, to stop the violence, to find acceptable forms of the future state structure and ensure the security of all ethnic and religious groups. That's the direction in which we're going to act.
Question: Did I understand you correctly that if Assad leaves, you can imagine such a transitional government without Assad? Or what does it mean when you say that Assad will leave?
Vladimir Putin: I want there to be no misunderstanding. I think that our position is absolutely justified and correct. Whether Assad should stay or leave, what the political leadership in Syria should be like, what structure should be adopted – that is not for you or for us to impose on the Syrian people from abroad.
We can encourage for the negotiation process, and only the warring parties in Syria can agree on the future structure, and only in that case will that structure be robust and long-term.
Angela Merkel (translated from Russian): On the matter of visiting the exhibition, the President and I agreed during our talks together that we’d happily visit this exhibition together with the press. The matter is thus resolved. 
Regarding the question on Syria and the conference on Syria, I think we should take the results of the G8’s work and make a real effort now to build the framework conditions for reaching the needed decisions.
We agreed at the G8 that many obstacles could come up that would make it hard to organise this conference, but if we all sign up to the idea and actually hold the conference, it might give us a small opportunity to get the political process started.
Vladimir Putin: Look at the situation today: there are problems in Iraq, even bigger problems in Libya, and problems in other countries in the region too. Isn’t this already enough to prevent us from taking more hasty action? Isn’t this enough to hold us back and teach us to be more cautious, give more thought to what we do, and base our action above all on what the people themselves want?
Let’s make a more thorough examination of the experience of these recent years and the consequences of our actions, and realise that these regions could turn into zones like the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which no one at all controls. What will we do then? 
We estimate that roughly 600 people from Russia and European countries are fighting on the side of the Syrian armed opposition. Once these people get weapons in their hands, where will they go with them? What will they do? This is not games and jokes. We need to be practical people here and take a pragmatic look at the problem.
Question: I have a question on your speech at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. You said something very important for business in general, but especially for Russian business, which has long been discussing this issue. You spoke of the need for an amnesty and you asked the State Duma to prepare this by the end of the current session. Which categories of people currently carrying out their sentences should qualify for the amnesty, in your view, and which groups would be excluded? 
Vladimir Putin: I already said that people who have committed crimes involving violence or the threat of violence should not be eligible.
”Russia and Germany both seek to develop closer industrial cooperation in sectors such as aircraft manufacturing, transport, energy machine-building, and pharmaceuticals.“
Of course, people who have committed crimes such as counterfeiting, and real swindlers and raiders, people who have cheated others and taken their apartments and so on should not be eligible.
The amnesty should apply to people whose actions come under the recent laws we have passed liberalising penalties in these areas. There are some violations that, if they were committed today, in view of the new laws we have passed, the offenders would not end up behind bars. It is these sorts of people who should be released.
Question: Mr President, coming back to the exhibition again, the items on display at the Hermitage include what is called ‘trophy art’ in Germany – objects that were taken from Germany to Russia during World War II. Has any progress been made on the question of returning these items, as was the government’s demand?
Vladimir Putin: This is a very sensitive issue for people in both countries I think. If we want to make any progress here, we should be careful not to blow the problem out of proportion, but to concentrate on looking for solutions. I don’t think we should open the debate right now, because you’ll immediately have people on the Russian side who will come forward to tally up the damage and losses that our art suffered during World War II.
I think that rather than trying to move in that direction we should follow the example of our art experts, who have worked together to make it possible for the general public to see the works of art that will be on display at the Hermitage today. This effort was made by the specialists on both sides, in Russia and in Germany.
Question: I have a question for both leaders. We all know that Russian-German bilateral trade is big in terms of numbers, but it is one-sided in nature, with raw materials making up the bulk of Russia’s exports. How long do you think this kind of trade structure can last, and what should we do to change the situation? 
Vladimir Putin: This is something we discussed today, and I am pleased to say that our bilateral trade structure is changing for the better. I spoke briefly about this today.
You can see this change by looking at how our German partners are now entering areas such as machine-tool manufacturing, the automotive industry, aircraft manufacturing, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The amount of investment and number of joint projects taking place in Russia are growing, and this is a good sign that we are slowly but steadily starting to change our trade structure.
Angela Merkel: I add for my part that Germany is open to other goods, related to the energy sector, for example. German companies offering education opportunities in Russia are giving young people a chance to make their contribution to diversifying the economy. We are open in all areas and will not create obstacles for companies. We will work towards achieving a balance in the diversity of goods.
Vladimir Putin: Madame Federal Chancellor, you are our guest of honour, and I would like to present you with this old print that commemorates 1894 and the signing of the Russian-German trade agreement.

Opening remarks at meeting with members of Russian and German business communities
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Our meeting with business representatives, which has by now become a tradition, is being held this time within the framework of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum which is a platform to discuss the most pressing problems in developing global trade. It is important that these discussions are being held with participation by Russian and foreign business communities.
I am especially pleased to have this particular group of people gathered today. It was made possible by Ms Federal Chancellor, because she agreed to come to St Petersburg for this forum, in spite of her tight schedule, with domestic policy matters becoming more intense due to the upcoming elections. But it’s nice that regardless of the situation the government of Germany is nevertheless giving due attention to the routine but highly important efforts of facilitating cooperation between the economies of such countries as Russia and Germany.
We opened the forum’s plenary session together and then engaged in substantive talks in a bilateral format.
”Germany is among our three largest economic partners. Over six thousand companies with German capital are operating in Russia. Large-scale bilateral projects are being successfully implemented in energy, shipbuilding, and sectors such as machine tool manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and other areas.“
I would like to note the following with regard to our cooperation. Overall, we have already spoken about this to the media, as well as at the forum itself, but I will repeat a few points nevertheless. Germany is among our three largest economic partners, and in 2012, we reached new heights, according to various estimates, of approximately 80 billion dollars. Last year, trade grew by 2.9 percent. Even though it did drop somewhat in the first quarter of this year and growth rates have decreased, I hope we will recover all this.
No doubt, we can cross an even more serious threshold: namely, 100 billion dollars in trade. So, just as always, this will require the input of business communities, the launch of new projects in our traditional areas of cooperation, as well as in manufacturing, the innovative sector and so on.
We have all the necessary prerequisites for that. In recent years, the Russian economy has undergone significant structural changes. We do understand they are still not sufficient, but nevertheless, we are emphatically moving in that direction.
Last year, Russia’s GDP growth was 3.4 percent, unemployment was at a historically low rate of 5.5 to 5.6 percent, the public debt was moderate at 2.3 to 2.5 percent [of GDP], and taken together with domestic debt, it stood at 10 to 11 percent.
The consistently high level of our [currency] reserves is growing further, thanks to the so-called budget rule, i.e., the contribution of all our oil and gas income after a certain threshold to reserve funds. The National Welfare Fund is nearing somewhere around 87 to 89 billion dollars. Another reserve fund – called the Government Reserve Fund – is at around 85 billion dollars. And the Central Bank’s gold and foreign currency reserves are worth 516 billion dollars.
We are consistently lowering the administrative burden on our entrepreneurs. Russian taxes are among the lowest in the world. According to the World Bank rating, in 2012, Russia rose by 8 points in terms of favourable business conditions.
Russia is actively modernising manufacturing facilities, implementing the newest technologies in the industries. We modernised the auto industry and are working on long-term programmes for developing medicine, pharmaceuticals, air and space and aircraft engineering.
”Russia is open to joint initiatives in modernising infrastructure. We are interested in getting German companies involved in upgrading facilities in transport and telecommunications systems.“
German companies are actively involved in these efforts supplying capital and technologies. German entrepreneurs – in other words, you, my most respected colleagues – have long and steadfastly been established in the Russian market. The total volume of aggregate German investments in 2012 was 25 billion dollars. Over six thousand companies with German capital are operating in Russia.
Large-scale bilateral projects are being successfully implemented in energy, shipbuilding, and sectors such as machine tool manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and other areas.
It is important for large companies as well as midsize and small businesses to get involved in implementing all these programmes. For our part, we are prepared to provide various forms of support, which I am confident will be effective.
Russia is open to joint initiatives in modernising infrastructure. We are interested in getting German companies involved in upgrading facilities in transport and telecommunications systems.
We could discuss all these new projects, initiatives and ideas in more detail today, in a relaxed atmosphere on the Neva river, taking our time.
You are quite familiar with Russia’s business environment, its difficulties and problems. Unfortunately, we still have quite a few such problems. It would be particularly valuable to hear your assessments so that we can find our bearings and prevent various threats before they appear.
I am confident that with our joint efforts, we will be able to create even more favourable conditions for the stable development of our national economies, improving our peoples’ living standards, and I very much hope our dialogue today will be open, substantive and engaged.
Thank you very much for your attention.
