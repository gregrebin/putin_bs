Meeting with Director of General Office of Chinese Communist Party Li Zhanshu.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, friends, good afternoon. I am very happy to see you in Moscow.
I believe it is very good that good working relations are developing between the Presidential Executive Office of Russia and the General Office of the Communist Party of China. This gives up hope, because there is more specific work being done, and a lot depends on how the executive offices operate.
I know that you maintain regular contacts with our great friend, my big personal friend – Chairman Xi Jinping
. Please convey my best wishes to him and remind him that we expect to see him in Moscow for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of Victory in World War II.
DIRECTOR OF THE GENERAL OFFICE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE LI ZHANSHU (retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much for finding the time to meet with me today.
I would like to begin by conveying to you greetings and best wishes from your good old friend Chairman Xi Jinping. He is looking forward to his trip to Moscow to take part in the events dedicated to the 70th anniversary of Victory, as well as his visit to Russia. He is also looking forward to his first meeting with you this year.
Mr President, I believe you and Chairman Xi Jinping are leaders of two great nations, two great politicians who have significant influence in the world. The fact that your mutual trust is growing stronger and you maintain regular contacts, consultations and cooperation is of great importance for the development and revival of our country, for ensuring peace and stability in the world at large.
I have counted – in the past 2 years you and Chairman Xi Jinping met 8 times, had 4 telephone conversations and exchanged letters more than 30 times. You have reached many agreements to develop cooperation between our two countries and generally to develop relations between China and Russia, and together you have brought our relations to a new stage and achieved new results. This year you are to have numerous meetings, both bilateral and within international events.
In this context, I would like to assure you that my office as well as the Executive Office of the President of Russia would both work to ensure that these meetings of the two leaders are held properly, at the highest possible level. We will do everything for this.
As you may know, Mr President, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee administration has never before had any contacts with the executive offices of foreign presidents. The regular contacts we have established with Mr Ivanov
[Chief of Staff of Presidential Executive Office] is a unique development in our relations. It is thanks to you and Chairman Xi Jinping that we have managed to lay the foundation of these new relations.
