President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh : I am happy that my first foreign visit is to the Russian Federation. It is timed to the 100 anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and Russia. This visit is of historical significance. During the talks with Mr Putin, we summed up the development of relations over the past century, exchanged in detail our views on further goals and areas of cooperation and on major joint projects, and mapped out prospects for joint actions for the next century.
