With Premier of the Chinese State Council Li Keqiang.
Premier of the Chinese State Council Li Keqiang (retranslated): It is a great pleasure to meet with you, Mr President, and to see you once again.
I welcome you to China to take part in celebrating the 70th anniversary of victory. I want to congratulate you and the Russian people on the Great Victory and the successful celebrations you held in Moscow on May 9. We are celebrating together, marking this victory in World War II, and in this way, we make common efforts to preserve peace in the region.
Last year, during my visit to Russia, you and my Russian friends gave me a very hospitable reception and I once again want to thank you for this. You are a guest from afar, and I am ready to exchange views with you on the subjects of mutual interest.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Premier,
Thank you very much for these warm words, for the warm reception, and for the invitation. Our contacts began when you were Deputy Premier of the State Council, and we have continued these working contacts all this time.
Tomorrow, we will take part in celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Chinese people’s victory in the war against Japan and the end of World War II. It is important that Russia and China are celebrating this holiday together, like the Victory Day holiday on May 9, which you mentioned. In this fashion, we demonstrate clearly to our peoples and the entire world that we share the view of the results of World War II and oppose attempts to deny or distort history.
Of course, we will use this good occasion to discuss our bilateral relations, which, despite the various external problems, are developing very intensively for the benefit of the Chinese and Russian peoples.
Li Keqiang: China and Russia are strategic partners. We are big neighbours and we stand up together for the results of World War II and oppose distortion and rewriting of these results.
