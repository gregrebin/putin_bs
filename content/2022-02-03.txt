Meeting with members of the Delovaya Rossiya National Public Organisation.
Taking part in the meeting were representatives of Delovaya Rossiya regional branches and general and coordinating councils, including owners of major Russian companies and members of the expert community.
The agenda included items such as stimulating private investment, reducing the administrative burden and excessive oversight, developing infrastructure, and improving legal regulations.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
I am happy to have this meeting with Delovaya Rossiya, one of the country’s leading business associations.
First of all, I would like to congratulate you, your entire organisation, on a remarkable date: Delovaya Rossiya turned 20 in December. It happened following our meeting in 2001, and on December 10, 2001, it was registered with the Ministry of Justice.
Over these years, your association, your movement, one might say, has united rapidly expanding non-commodity mid-sized businesses across almost all industries and sectors of our economy. Branches have been opened in every constituent entity of the Russian Federation, and colleagues from the regions are also here with us today, you can see them on the screen, they are participating in our meeting.
Such broad representation and deep understanding of entrepreneurs’ problems makes it possible for Delovaya Rossiya to discuss items on the economic, legislative and business agenda in the most concrete way and to conduct a constructive dialogue with government bodies of all levels as partners.
I believe this feedback is extremely important and, moreover, necessary for our joint effective work, for developing strategic decisions on growing the Russian economy and improving the investment climate, and for preparing operational measures to support businesses. For example, such measures were adopted two years ago with the involvement of Delovaya Rossiya and other associations, and recently, too, at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic and as we fought to control it during all these events.
I know that Delovaya Rossiya focuses on improving the business environment and launching new entrepreneurial initiatives to create new modern jobs and industries. We constantly discuss this during personal meetings. This includes improving regulations, supporting investment, expanding infrastructure, digitisation, and so on. We have many items on the agenda.
I am sure you have specific proposals regarding these issues based on practical experience, as it has always been. In fact, this is the purpose of ongoing cooperation at all levels between government and business representatives who work in various associations.
I hope effective decisions that matter to all Russian entrepreneurs will be made as a result of our meeting today as well.
Today, we have online not only members of your movement, or association, but my colleagues from the Government as well. You can see them on the screen. We are at your disposal. I will also take questions, if any, and state my position. As a rule, very specific questions are asked at meetings like this one, very technical, I would say, so I may ask my colleagues from the Government for help. You can see them here on the screen.
Please, let us get to work.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
It is a pleasure to receive President Fernandez of the Argentine Republic in the Kremlin. This is his first visit to Russia.
During our businesslike and constructive talks, the President and I reviewed in detail the full range of bilateral relations. We discussed in practical terms potential areas for further developing the comprehensive strategic partnership of our countries. We also exchanged views on some current international and regional issues.

Talks with President of Argentina Alberto Fernandez
February 3, 2022
I would like to note that Argentina is one of Russia’s key partners in Latin America. For over 150 years, our countries have been united by kind, friendly relations that are based on equality, respect, and regard for each other’s interests. We are doing all we can to promote our close, mutually beneficial cooperation and look for new areas of interaction. As today’s meeting showed, the President shares this approach.
I would like to emphasise that Russia and Argentina maintain productive cooperation in combatting the spread of the coronavirus. Argentina was the first country in the Western Hemisphere to register the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Russia has supplied Argentina with almost 15 million vaccine doses. In addition, an Argentine pharmaceutical company has produced over six million doses in Buenos Aires province where local production of the Russian vaccine is based.
We are pleased to note that despite the difficult situation caused by the pandemic, Russia and Argentina are developing economic ties. Bilateral trade increased by 50 percent during the past year.
There are good opportunities for stepping up bilateral investment cooperation. Russian and Argentine businesses are interested in working with each other.
Last December, a big Russian business mission visited Argentina. They held talks with a broad range of Argentine partners and the President personally welcomed our entrepreneurs in Buenos Aires, for which we are grateful to him.
The relevant intergovernmental commission has to step up its efforts to promote and diversify bilateral economic cooperation. The Russian-Argentine and Argentine-Russian business councils also have a big role to play in developing business ties. These two councils discussed promising ideas for cooperation at their regular videoconference the other day.
I would like to mention the participation of the Russian company Transmashholding in upgrading railways in Argentina as an example of successful bilateral cooperation. Recently, this Russian company won a big tender for the supply of electric trains. Importantly, local production in Argentina will amount to up to 25 percent of the total. In addition, Russian companies are ready to join the implementation of other projects in railway infrastructure, such as supplies of rolling stock and other equipment.
In turn, Rosatom is willing to offer Argentina assistance in further developing its power industry.
There exist good opportunities for promoting cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. They were created when the relevant intergovernmental protocol entered in force in December 2020.
We see considerable potential for expanding cooperation in geological prospecting, construction and maintenance of energy and oil-and-gas infrastructure, renewable energy, the chemical industry and machine building, to name a few.
We are enhancing interbank cooperation. In 2020, the central banks of Russia and Argentina signed a memorandum on cooperation. Commercial banks are upgrading their contacts.
Bilateral cultural and humanitarian ties are making good progress. The Cinema Online project was launched virtually by the Russian House [Russian Science and Culture Centre] in Buenos Aires in 2021. It hosts weekly screenings of the best Soviet and Russian films. The Russia Today media holding is successfully operating in Argentina.
And, of course, I would like to say special thanks to the President for his support of Moscow’s bid for the EXPO-2030 World Fair.
The exchange of views on global and regional problems showed that Russia and Argentina hold similar or identical positions on many issues. Our countries firmly uphold the principles of the supremacy of international law, sovereignty, independence, and non-interference in the domestic affairs of foreign states. We agreed to continue coordinating our efforts on key multilateral issues at international venues, including the UN.
We are ready to step up efforts to expand ties between integration associations, above all, the Eurasian Economic Union and the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), and to cooperate more closely within the G20.
In closing, I would like to thank Mr Fernandez for the focused, candid and substantive dialogue. I am convinced that today’s exchange of views and talks will serve to further strengthen the comprehensive strategic partnership between our countries.
Both Mr Fernandez and I will participate in the opening ceremony for the 24th Olympic Winter Games in Beijing tomorrow. I would like to wish good luck and success to Russian and Argentine athletes.
Thank you.
President of the Argentine Republic Alberto Fernandez
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
It was a great honour for me to meet with you today.
We had a very candid and open conversation on matters that our countries are addressing as part of the bilateral agenda. Both countries support the logic of multilateral cooperation and a multipolar world.
Argentina owes a debt of gratitude to the Russian Federation, because Russia was the first country to make sure that Argentina received the coronavirus vaccine. This help made it possible for us to be the first to gain access to the Russian Sputnik vaccine, which helped us mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our people.
Based on this, we can expand our technology cooperation. Together, we can launch the production of not only vaccines, but other products as well. This could involve Russian investment in Argentina. We can ensure the exchange of technology, or the transfer of technology, so that Argentina can continue to industrialise its economy.
We spoke about things that President Putin addressed in depth. This, of course, concerns cooperation in railway infrastructure, trains, cooperation in the energy sector, gas production, and innovative technologies in the energy sector, such as solar and wind energy.
We spoke about the opportunities offered by Argentina and exchanged views on the circumstances in which the world and our region are now living. I asked President Putin to make full use of the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement that Argentina signed with Russia in 2015 and to deepen our cooperation so that it becomes an effective reality and Argentina and Russia can gradually expand ties.
I am leaving Moscow very happy today. I am grateful to President Putin for the hospitality. I wish I could stay several days more and continue this wonderful visit, but tomorrow I will see the President of Russia at the Winter Olympic Games.
Thank you again.
I am absolutely sure that we are taking a very important step forward in deepening the fraternal ties between Argentina and Russia for the benefit of both countries.
Thank you.

Interview with China Media Group
Ahead of his visit to People’s Republic of China, the President of Russia answered questions from China Media Group President and Editor-in-Chief Shen Haixiong.
February 3, 2022
02:05
President of China Media Group Shen Haixiong (retranslated): Mr. President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to interview you again. First, let me welcome you to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. In February 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the 22nd Winter Olympics in Sochi at your invitation. This was the first time a Chinese leader had attended a major international sporting event abroad. Then, Xi Jinping said: ”If our neighbors have a joyous occasion, we certainly should go there to congratulate them.“ Today is a joyous occasion for China – we are hosting the Winter Olympics for the first time; all the more so as it comes in the midst of the Spring Festival (the Chinese Lunar New Year). When applying to host the Winter Olympics, China announced a plan to engage 300 million people in winter sports. Now, ski resorts are being built even in my home province of Zhejiang in southern China. You were the first foreign leader to confirm your arrival at the opening ceremony. What special role does sport play in relations between the two neighbors China and Russia? How can our countries strengthen cooperation in ice and snow culture, winter sports and related industries? What results do you expect from Russian athletes at the Olympics? Can you predict how many gold medals they will win?
Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping and I have known each other for a long time, as good friends and politicians who hold largely the same views on addressing the world's problems; we maintain close and frequent contact. That is why, I immediately responded to his invitation to visit China and to join our Chinese friends in celebrating this year's main sporting event – the Winter Olympic Games. Moreover, the first ever Winter Olympics on Chinese soil will take place in the midst of the Chinese New Year, in Beijing – the first city in the world to host both the Summer and Winter Games.
I know that the organizers have done a good job preparing for the Games. They made massive investments in sports and transport infrastructure, built modern sports venues. They created an environment for the safe stay of foreign athletes, coaches and journalists.
I am sure that such excellent preparations for the Olympics will help the Olympic athletes to show their sporting character and demonstrate their skills and ability to achieve their goals in a fair and uncompromising competition. Naturally, we will be supporting our athletes, we will celebrate their every victory and every achievement. But only the competition will show how many and what medals they will win. Besides, the epidemiological situation may have an impact on athletes' participation and, consequently, on the final results.
Sport is a unique phenomenon of human civilization. Major sports festivals are designed to bring nations together, deepen mutual understanding and promote the universally accepted principle of ”fair play“, as was vividly illustrated by the success of the large-scale sporting events such as the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, hosted by our country.
Russia has been and remains committed to the traditional Olympic values. We oppose the attempts to politicize sport or use it as a tool of coercion, unfair competition and discrimination. We reject the practice of ”collective punishment“ for acts perpetrated by individual people, which has recently become a frequent occurrence. And of course, we strongly condemn the use of prohibited substances by athletes and advocate broad international cooperation in the fight against doping in sport.
Our country has a well-developed infrastructure, sports schools known for their champions and traditions, and a rich history of sporting records; it organizes major international competitions, encouraging our citizens, especially our youth, to engage in physical culture and sports. This is what helps to preserve the health of the people and the nation as a whole and shape a strong foundation for future sporting achievements. We expect that by 2024 the share of people regularly engaging in sports will be 55 percent and by 2030 it will reach 70 percent.
As for the interaction between Russia and China in sports and physical education, it occupies an important place in our bilateral humanitarian cooperation and is broad and complex in nature. A number of events, including those in winter sports, have become truly important. Among them are the Russian-Chinese Winter Youth Games and annual ice hockey matches on the Amur River between teams representing the two countries' border regions. We are actively developing exchanges between Russian and Chinese sports federations and professional clubs. For several years now, the Chinese hockey club Kunlun Red Star has played in the Russian Kontinental Hockey League, which was agreed during my visit to China in 2016. Cooperation is also developing in junior hockey. President Xi and I visited one of the games between Russian and Chinese teams in June 2018.
The Russian and Chinese years of cooperation in physical education and sports in 2022–2023, which President Xi Jinping and I announced in December 2021, will certainly be a significant, memorable event for our two countries. Its programme includes about 500 various popular and youth sports events, as well as educational, sports science and staff training activities. Activities that prove most successful will continue to be organized on a regular basis.
I firmly believe that the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing will be held to the highest standards. I wish successful performance and luck to all athletes, participants in the Olympics, and bright unforgettable moments and joy to the guests.
Shen Haixiong: Initially, China and Russia viewed each other as friendly nations and then they established the relations of constructive partnership, strategic partnership, comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction. In June 2019, we took them to an even higher level, opening a new era in our relations. During a videoconference on 28 June 2021, you and President Xi Jinping announced the extension of the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. How important do you think this step is for the bilateral relations?
Vladimir Putin: The Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation signed more than 20 years ago is a basic policy document that established the legal framework for a long-term consistent development of the Sino-Russian relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction. That is why, on June 28 last year, President Xi Jinping and I decided to extend it for another five years.
It is a very rich document in terms of ideas contained in it, many of its provisions being rediscovered in the context of today's rapidly changing international environment.
Relations between Russia and China are developing on an equal, de-ideologised basis. Our partnership is sustainable, intrinsically valuable, not affected by the political climate and not aimed against anyone. It is underpinned by respect, regard for each other's core interests, adherence to international law and the UN Charter.
The atmosphere of political trust created, among other things, thanks to this treaty, has allowed our countries to establish a multilayer structure of interstate cooperation, with meetings of the two leaders playing a key role.
China remains firmly at the top of the list of Russia's trade partners. According to preliminary data, last year, even despite the pandemic-related restrictions, our bilateral trade reached a historic high, totalling 140 billion dollars.
China is our strategic partner in the international arena. Our approaches to most issues on the global agenda concur or are really close. We engage in close coordination within many leading multilateral organizations and formats, such as the UN, BRICS, SCO, G20, APEC and EAS, which has a stabilizing effect on the current difficult world situation.
To sum up, I would like to reiterate that the concepts laid out in the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation have allowed our countries to achieve an unprecedentedly high level of partnership, fundamentally changed its character and scope, and created the conditions enabling us to move forward together.
Shen Haixiong: If you don't mind, I would like to ask my last question on behalf of all internet users and winter sports lovers in China. In an interview you gave me three years ago you said you were ”trying“ to play hockey. However, that appears to be quite an understatement. In a Night Hockey League match held in May last year, you scored a goal just 30 seconds into the game and a total of 8 goals in the entire match, which is comparable to the results of professional hockey players. Could you share any secrets of your prowess with Chinese ice hockey enthusiasts? Do you have any ideas as to who of the Russian hockey players will score the first goal at the Olympic Games? What winter sports other than ice hockey would you like to master?
Vladimir Putin:I am not in a position to give any advice to people who are passionate about hockey. I would leave this to professional hockey players and coaches. I think the most important thing is to do your favourite sport – no matter what it is – on a routine basis and to work hard keeping your goal in sight. Over time, mastery will come.
Ice hockey in Russia is big and has deep-rooted traditions. A special place here belongs to the Night Hockey League established in 2011. Today, it brings together almost 1100 teams with more than 20 thousand players from most regions of our country. Many of our renowned Olympic and world champions are actively involved in the development of the project, for which I am very grateful.
The success achieved is evident. Last year, the number of amateur ice hockey players in Russia amounted to over 620 thousand, and that number is constantly growing.
It is always a great pleasure for me to take part in the events of the League whenever my schedule allows. Every chance I get, I go alpine skiing. However, there are other sports disciplines I am interested in. I like biathlon and figure skating, where our athletes have traditionally been very strong. I enjoy watching competitions in ski flying but, for lack of time, can only do it on TV.
Of course, we expect our hockey team to show its best performance at the upcoming Olympics. Russia's ice hockey squad is well-prepared, united by the team spirit and the will to win, and all its members are capable of scoring the first goal.
There is no doubt that the hockey matches at the Olympics will, as always, be exciting and memorable. We are looking forward to seeing some fine play and, naturally, trust in our players and wish them every success.

They discussed the current status and development prospects of the comprehensive Russian-Argentine strategic partnership in the political, trade, economic and cultural-humanitarian spheres, and interaction on the Covid-19 response effort, as well as topical international and regional issues.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, it is a pleasure to see you.
We have been planning this in-person meeting for a long time. Unfortunately, it was not possible for it to go ahead because of the epidemiological situation. To the best of my knowledge, we met in January 2020 at events in Israel commemorating the victims of the Holocaust. Nevertheless, contacts have continued unabated all this time.
Of course, we are grateful to you because Argentina was the first country in the Western Hemisphere to register the Sputnik V vaccine. The first contract has now been virtually fulfilled: almost 15 million of the 20 million doses have been delivered to Argentina. This vaccine is already being manufactured at factories in Argentina, and over six million doses have already been produced. The registration of the Sputnik M vaccine for young people aged 12–17 is now being discussed. And I would like to congratulate you on such a large-scale vaccination effort. Almost 78 percent of your population have been inoculated, and this is a very good outcome.

Of course, we still have a lot to accomplish in order to advance our trade and economic cooperation, which increased by 50 percent in 2021. This is a very serious, impressive result, and the pace is satisfactory.
We have many positive areas of cooperation, our colleagues are working at healthcare ministries, foreign ministries, and other agencies, too.
Your brief stay in Russia is also linked with this situation. But I hope that we will be able to continue these personal contacts in Argentina and here in Russia. We are going to Beijing together, for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games. But, as I see it, we will find it more convenient to talk here, in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and to discuss all our bilateral issues and the situation on the international scene, too.
I am happy to see you. Welcome to Russia.
President of the Argentine Republic Alberto Fernandez
(retranslated): Mr President,
First, this is a great honour for me, thank you for the invitation, I was eager to see you. It is a great pleasure for me to meet with you in Moscow where we can talk in a calm atmosphere and discuss how we should promote cooperation between Argentina and Russia in all areas.
People in Argentina appreciate Russia a lot, and notably, your assistance with the vaccines that you sent us. This was very important to us in countering the pandemic. Indeed, you provided us with significant support at that time and we are very grateful to you because we did not have enough vaccines then. Thanks to you, we did a good job and the results of our efforts were excellent.
I had two doses myself and then I waited a bit before getting a third dose of Sputnik.
Vladimir Putin: Me too.
Alberto Fernandez: Indeed, we are deeply grateful for this assistance because the rest of the world did not help us with vaccines. This is very important and highly valued.
I think we can deepen and expand this substantial groundwork because there are many areas in which we can cooperate very well.
I believe that Argentina could become Russia’s gateway to Latin America to a certain extent. We could be a venue for the development of your cooperation with Latin American nations. The vaccine example is indicative because we became a stepping stone in the supply of the Russian vaccine to Ecuador, Peru and Paraguay, and this is very important.
I think this is a great opportunity for developing our cooperation, and Argentine society is willing to do this, relying, of course, on your support.
Argentina is now facing a difficult situation because we have serious external debt and challenging economic issues.
Since the 1990s, Argentina has been strongly oriented towards the United States. Argentina and its economy are largely dependent on the US and our relations with it. In fact, our debt to the IMF also emerged because of this relationship.
At first, when our party was in power from 2003 to 2015, we tried hard to get rid of this dependence on the US. We achieved a lot towards this end. You will remember, at that time we signed a strategic agreement with Russia, thereby upgrading our bilateral ties.
A different party came to power in Argentina in 2015. It resumed these relations with the US, and this largely explains our external debt.
I am consistently working to rid Argentina of this dependence on the IMF and the US. I want Argentina to open up new opportunities. Cooperation with Russia is vital for us. I would like to assure you, and I hope that you will accept my assurances that we do want to develop cooperation with Russia.

Article by Vladimir Putin ”Russia and China: A Future-Oriented Strategic Partnership“ for the Chinese News Agency Xinhua
February 3, 2022
02:00
On the eve of my upcoming visit to China, I am pleased to address directly the large Chinese and foreign audience of Xinhua, the world's largest news agency.
Our countries are close neighbours bound by centuries-old traditions of friendship and trust. We highly appreciate that Russian-Chinese relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation, entering a new era, have reached an unprecedented level and have become a model of efficiency, responsibility, and aspiration for the future. The basic principles and guidelines for joint work were defined by our countries in the Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, the twentieth anniversary of which we celebrated last year. These are, first and foremost, equality, consideration of one another's interests, freedom from political and ideological circumstances, as well as from the vestiges of the past. These are the principles we are consistently building on year after year in the spirit of continuity to deepen our political dialogue. Despite the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, we are striving to dynamically build the capacity of economic partnerships and expand humanitarian exchanges.
During the upcoming visit, the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping and I will thoroughly discuss key issues on the bilateral, regional, and global agendas. It is symbolic that our meeting will take place during the Spring Festival – the Chinese Lunar New Year. After all, as the Chinese saying goes, ”make your whole year's plan in the spring“.
The development of business ties will certainly be given special attention. There is every opportunity for this as our countries have substantial financial, industrial, technological and human resources allowing us to successfully resolve long-term development issues. By working together, we can achieve stable economic growth and improve the well-being of our citizens, strengthen our competitiveness, and stand together against today's risks and challenges.
At the end of 2021, the volume of mutual trade increased by more than a third, exceeding the record level of 140 billion U.S. dollars. We are well on the way towards our goal of increasing the volume of trade to 200 billion U.S. dollars a year. A number of important initiatives are being implemented in the investment, manufacturing, and agro-industrial sectors. In particular, the portfolio of the Intergovernmental Commission on Investment Cooperation includes 65 projects worth over 120 billion U.S. dollars. This is about collaboration in such industries as mining and mineral processing, infrastructure construction, and agriculture.
We are consistently expanding the practice of settlements in national currencies and creating mechanisms to offset the negative impact of unilateral sanctions. A major milestone in this work was the signing of the Agreement between the Government of Russia and the Government of the PRC on payments and settlements in 2019.
A mutually beneficial energy alliance is being formed between our countries. Along with long-term supplies of Russian hydrocarbons to China, we have plans to implement a number of large-scale joint projects. The construction of four new power units at Chinese nuclear power plants with the participation of Rosatom State Corporation launched last year is one of them. All this significantly strengthens the energy security of China and the Asia region as a whole.
We see an array of opportunities in the development of partnerships in information and communication technologies, medicine, space exploration, including the use of national navigation systems and the International Lunar Research Station project. A serious impetus to strengthening bilateral ties was given by the cross Years of Russian-Chinese Scientific, Technical and Innovative Cooperation in 2020–2021.
We are grateful to our Chinese colleagues for their assistance in launching the production of Russian Sputnik V and Sputnik Light vaccines in China and for the timely supply of necessary protective equipment to our country. We hope that this cooperation will develop and strengthen.
One of Russia's strategic objectives is to accelerate the social and economic upliftment of Siberia and the Russian Far East. These territories are immediate neighbors of the PRC. We also intend to actively develop interregional ties. Thus, the modernization of the Baikal-Amur Mainline and the Trans-Siberian Railway has been started. By 2024, their capacity must increase one and a half times through higher volumes of transit cargo and reduced transport time. The port infrastructure in the Russian Far East is also growing. All this should further enhance the complementarity of the Russian and Chinese economies.
And, of course, the conservation of nature and shared ecosystems remains an important area of bilateral cross-border and interregional cooperation. These issues have always been the focus of our countries' public attention, and we will certainly discuss them in detail during the negotiations, as well as a wide range of humanitarian topics.
Russia and China are countries with thousands of years of unique traditions and tremendous cultural heritage, the interest in which is persistently high both in our countries and abroad. It is true that in the last two years the number of tourists, joint mass events, and direct contacts between our citizens has reduced due to the pandemic. However, I have no doubt that we will catch up and, as soon as the situation allows, will launch new outreach and educational programs to introduce our citizens to the history and present-day life of the two countries. Thus, President Xi Jinping and I have agreed to hold the Years of Russian-Chinese cooperation in physical fitness and sports in 2022 and 2023.
Certainly, an important part of the visit will be a discussion of relevant international topics. The coordination of the foreign policy of Russia and China is based on close and coinciding approaches to solving global and regional issues. Our countries play an important stabilizing role in today's challenging international environment, promoting the democratization of the system of interstate relations to make it more equitable and inclusive. We are working together to strengthen the central coordinating role of the United Nations in global affairs and to prevent the international legal system, with the UN Charter at its centre, from being eroded.
Russia and China are actively cooperating on the broadest agenda within BRICS, RIC, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as well as other associations. Within the G20, we are committed to taking national specifics into account when formulating our recommendations, be it the fight against pandemics or the implementation of the climate agenda. Thanks to a large extent to our countries' shared solidarity, following the 2021 G20 Summit in Rome informed decisions were made on international cooperation to restore economic growth, recognize vaccines and vaccine certificates, optimize energy transitions, and reduce digitalization risks.
We also have convergent positions on international trade issues. We advocate maintaining an open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system based on the rules of the World Trade Organization. We support relaunching of global supply chains. Back in March 2020, Russia proposed an initiative on ”green trade corridors“ that excludes any sanctions, political and administrative barriers. Its implementation is a useful aid to overcoming the economic consequences of the pandemic.
The XXIV Olympic Winter Games starting in Beijing are a major event of global significance. Russia and China are leading sporting nations renowned for their sporting traditions and not once have hosted the largest international competitions with dignity. I fondly remember my visit to Beijing in August 2008 to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Guests and athletes from Russia will remember the vivid performance for a long time, and the Games themselves were organized with the scale and exceptional hospitality inherent to our Chinese friends. For our part, we were delighted to host President Xi Jinping at the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Sadly, attempts by a number of countries to politicize sports to the benefit of their ambitions have recently intensified. This is fundamentally wrong and contrary to the very spirit and principles of the Olympic Charter. The power and greatness of sports are that it brings people together, gives moments of triumph and pride for the country and delights with fair, just and uncompromising competition. And these approaches are shared by most of the states participating in the international Olympic Movement.
Our Chinese friends have done tremendous work to prepare well for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. I am convinced that China's extensive experience in the excellent organization of representative international competitions will make it possible to hold this festival of world sports at the highest level. I would like to wish the Russian and Chinese teams impressive results and new records!
I send my warmest congratulations to the friendly people of China on the occasion of the Spring Festival, which marks the beginning of the Year of the Tiger. I wish you good health, prosperity, and success.
