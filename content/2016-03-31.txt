We can see the serious consequences of the practically uncontrolled flow of refugees to Europe from countries in the Middle East, North Africa, from Afghanistan and other regions. It has caused an outburst of crime, ethnic and religious conflicts and social tension. Migrants, who have practically no opportunity to integrate into society, become the object of propaganda and are recruited by extremist and terrorist organisations. Radicalism among them is growing. However, there is growing radicalism among the local population as well.
We need a proper analysis of this situation to draw our own conclusions from the migration crisis in Europe, to adjust our actions where necessary with due account of existing and potential threats.

We should also constantly monitor the situation in the Middle East and other regions of the world that could spark new waves of migration. Primarily this applies to regions close to Russia’s borders and the borders of our partners in the Eurasian Economic Union, CSTO and the CIS.
Colleagues,
Russia has traditionally been attractive for immigrants. We are open for those who are willing to respect our laws, culture, traditions and language and to work honestly.
Over the past year, we have simplified many procedures that allow foreigners to stay and work in Russia. Thus, for instance, migrants from the CIS states coming to stay for up to 3 months may submit their registration notifications at local post offices. We have simplified the procedures for obtaining work patents. At the same time, we have introduced requirements regarding the knowledge of the Russian language, legislation and history. We have simplified the procedures for obtaining medical insurance by migrants. All this is designed to help decent migrants to adapt in Russia.

I would like to note that in 2012 we approved the Concept of the State Migration Policy through 2025. The implementation of its first stage involved an improvement of migration laws, including in the interests of national security. We are working to prevent illegal migration and illegal employment and have taken measures to improve migration control.
At the same time, we are well aware that the situation with migration, particularly illegal migration, bears additional risks and requires close attention. Thus, many migrants exceed the duration of their permitted stay in Russia, being actually out of control of the state and law enforcement agencies and often getting involved in criminal or semi-criminal businesses.
Criminal groups, drug dealers, foreign special services and emissaries of international extremist and terrorist organisations are trying to use illegal migration routes. We need to firmly supress all such attempts through the active work of the relevant agencies. This includes stronger protection of state border sections in regions that pose an additional threat in terms of illegal migration. All possible ‘windows’ should be reliably shut.
Over the past year, we have simplified many procedures that allow foreigners to stay and work in our country. All this is designed to help decent migrants to adapt in Russia.
Next. We need to step up cooperation with relevant agencies in other countries and international organisations, using both the existing experience and contacts and new forms of cooperation in combatting illegal migration.
The steady crime rate among foreign citizens causes serious concern. This problem was raised at the recent board meetings of the Interior Ministry and the Prosecutor General’s Office. These are usually high-profile crimes that often lead to an outburst of xenophobic, nationalistic sentiments and serve as an excuse for all sorts of informational and propaganda attacks on Russia. I would like to ask our agencies to enhance their operational and crime prevention work among migrants.
Disrupting schemes to legalise migrants arriving in Russia in violation of the law remains a strong priority. Law enforcement agencies and special services need to identify and stop the activities of organisations involved in this criminal business and expose their corruptive ties.

Greater coordination between the ministries and agencies involved in this work remains a major issue.
Let’s begin our work.
