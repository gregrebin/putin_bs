I am sure you have noticed the professionalism demonstrated by our Direct Investment Fund under the leadership of Mr Dmitriyev. It has already attracted over $10 billion, and we, in turn, are allocating funds for priority projects that are of interest to us.
We are now attracting funding from the National Welfare Fund for a number of promising projects, including high technology ones. I spoke about this at the plenary session today.
One such project is to bring high-speed internet to small and remote residential areas of Russia. Another one is to enhance the infrastructural capacity of our power grids. We have many other interesting areas of cooperation as well.
I will not make any lengthy speeches. Today we can speak informally of the issues you find worth discussing.
I would like to ask Mr Dmitriev to say a few words.
Russian Direct Invetsment Fund Ceo Kirill Dmitriev: Mr President, colleagues, thank you.
I wanted very briefly to tell you that here today we have heads of the world’s leading funds managing more than $3.6 trillion. This is a trillion more than we had last year.
Practically all the major sovereign funds of the world are represented here. I believe it is very significant that they believe in the prospects of the Russian economy and have come to Russia in these complicated geopolitical times.
The President has mentioned a number of deals. True, yesterday the RDIF Supervisory Board approved investment from the National Welfare Fund, and a number of our co-investors are taking part in these projects, which are of great significance for Russia.
In addition, this week we approved a deal to invest $700 million into the Sibur liquefied natural gas terminal, and investment into agriculture jointly with Arab, Chinese and European investors.
During the visit to China, we announced three new deals of the Russian-Chinese fund: investment into logistics, tourism and the construction of the first bridge between Russia and China. Thus, within only one week the Fund closed a series of very important deals.
Our rate of return is rather good: our first deals were the acquisition of a small stake in the Moscow Exchange, which brings in 20% annual interest, and a deal with Rostelecom, where we have made over 30%.With Prime Minister of Mongolia Norovyn Altankhuyag.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I met with the President of Mongolia while in Shanghai and we discussed our joint plans, big projects, and looked at the problems and prospects.
I am very happy that you have come to St Petersburg for the International Economic Forum, where we have the possibility of coming back to these problems and you will have the opportunity to discuss issues in more detail with your colleagues from the Russian Government. 
Prime Minister of Mongolia Norovyn Altankhuyag (retranslated): I am very pleased to have this chance to meet, Mr Putin.
First of all, I want to express our thanks to you for inviting us to take part in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. The Forum is very interesting and productive. We think it is a big event in Russia’s economic life and in global economic life. 
Developing our traditionally friendly ties with the Russian Federation is one of Mongolia’s foreign policy priorities. We think we should put together a medium-term programme for developing the strategic partnership between Mongolia and Russia and in this way lay the foundation and draft the roadmap for taking our relations further. 
Our delegation has been taking part in the Forum and we have also had a number of bilateral meetings. We met this morning with Mr Yakunin [Russian Railways CEO] to discuss our bilateral issues in the railways sector. Later, we met with Russian representatives to discuss our joint ventures’ continued work. We met just recently with Mr Kiriyenko [CEO of Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation] and discussed issues related to uranium. We also met with Mr Sechin [Rosneft CEO] when he visited Mongolia.
