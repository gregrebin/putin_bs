Meeting on developing the aerospace defence system.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Today we already began our conversation with the issue of supplying the Russian Air Force with new technology, and now let’s talk in a bit more detail about the aerospace defence system. We are all well aware that it to a large extent underpins strategic parity and the balance of power. In general, it is one of the most important components of a country’s defence.
We are moving forward in this direction, and there is progress. By way of example, let me highlight the Voronezh missile attack early warning radar station. It is already operational in Armavir, Kaliningrad and Lekhtusi. And I must say that in September this year, during combat-like exercises, it detected launches from the Mediterranean region, and effectively proved its efficiency and reliability.
In accordance with plans for the next five years, we will need to commission seven more such stations.
I would note that the process of re-equipping air defence missile formations and military units with modern S-400 systems is proceeding according to plan. This year two regimental sets of this system were delivered to troops, and another three are due in 2014. And these are good indicators, a good pace, and I hope that it can be sustained.
Of course, we should talk not only about modern technologies, but also cutting-edge ones. Incidentally, we talked about this during a meeting at Obukhovo Plant this summer. And in this regard, let me remind you that at the time we spoke about the Vityaz middle-range guided missile system, as well as the development of the advanced S-500 anti-aircraft missile system. This last system does more than simply perform air defence-related tasks; essentially it will be a component of our missile defence.
Let’s talk about all this in more detail.

Meeting on developing the Air Force
Vladimir Putin held a meeting on developing Russia’s Air Force.

Meeting on developing the Air Force. With Air Force Commander Viktor Bondarev and President of United Aircraft Corporation Mikhail Pogosyan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
Today we will continue what we started yesterday, namely a discussion about carrying out state defence procurement orders, this time in reference to aviation, military aviation.
Professionals are well aware that the role and importance of aviation has been constantly increasing since the First World War. Today aviation – especially in the light of modern technology – accomplishes military, transport and intelligence tasks. And in this regard we have a large programme to develop our military aviation.
This year 86 new aircraft and over 100 new helicopters were commissioned into our Air Force. Next year we expect a further 120 aircraft and about 90 helicopters, and by 2020 our troops should receive about 1,600 – or more precisely 1,591 – samples of the newest aircraft technology. This is how we plan to equip 70 percent of our fleet with the newest technology.
I want to emphasise once again that we have drawn up the plans and allocated the funds; now we need to work. We need to comply strictly with the production, testing and acceptance deadlines, and monitor the quality. Our main producer in Russia is the United Aircraft Corporation. Today we shall see how harmoniously financing is being allocated, and how synchronously businesses are operating.
What are the things I would like to draw attention to? First, it’s strengthening strategic nuclear airborne forces. We need to step up work on the new prospective air complex for long-range aviation, PAK DA. Our work on the Sukhoi PAK FA, the prospective airborne complex of frontline aviation, is well underway. Several aircraft are being tested, fine-tuned and refined. We are actively working on next-generation propulsion systems. Naturally, some issues remain open, but I have virtually no doubt that our plans will be completed. But we must start working on the PAK DA and do that actively.
Naturally, we have to continue modernising the Tu-160 and Tu-95MS. You know what we have to work on: electronics and other things too. The potential of these systems is far from exhausted. And with regards to long-range aviation, much can be done to modernise and bring this technology to a higher level.
The second issue is increasing supplies of tactical fighter aircraft, I mean the Su-25SM and Su-34, fifth-generation fighters that I have already mentioned.
And the third thing is developing and expanding promising unmanned systems. They are used increasingly often throughout the world. We will not be doing it like some other countries do. This is no game, it is not computer games, but rather serious military aircraft designed for both strikes and intelligence. And it is quite clear that they have good prospects. We must not only think about this, but also make all these plans a reality.
Let’s talk about all these topics.

Meeting on preparations for the 2014 Olympics
Vladimir Putin listened to reports on preparations for the Sochi Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.

Meeting on preparations for the 2014 Olympics.
Taking part in the meeting were, among others, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, Presidential Aide Igor Levitin, Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Southern Federal District Vladimir Ustinov, and Krasnodar Territory Governor Alexander Tkachev.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
We agreed to literally compare notes as we work during the final weeks of preparations for the Olympic Games.
Much has been done – almost everything – but when I say ‘almost’, this means that some things still have to be refined. The main facilities are ready, and test events have been held virtually everywhere. But we still need to talk more carefully and in more detail about, for example, the main stadium [Fisht Central Olympic Stadium] where the opening and closing ceremonies will take place. This is because the equipment needs to be installed and all the necessary preparatory work has to be done.
We need to act particularly carefully with regards to the so-called ticket programme, one we have already talked about. We must give people from different Russian regions the opportunity to attend this sporting festival, while proceeding from the assumption that pricing will be flexible, and enable people with different income levels to attend the Olympics.
Naturally, preparations for the Paralympic Games are a separate issue. We must do everything possible for our Paralympians; they are not merely courageous and talented people, they are also star athletes. In Russia they achieve simply outstanding results. And ensuring all necessary conditions for them – in addition to everything else, in addition to paying due attention to people with disabilities (and of course this is not a very relevant term for Paralympians) – represents a more pragmatic, essential interest than points, goals, seconds or medals. For us, it is more fundamental than that. We certainly have high expectations for them, and therefore must provide them with appropriate facilities for training and participating in competitions.
Yesterday we visited some facilities, and tomorrow we will continue to examine where our preparations stand in others, namely the coastal cluster in the Imeretin Valley.
Now, let’s talk in detail about all the issues I raised, and discuss problems if there are any.
I did not mention questions related to public transport and the way the city itself will function. I hope that the regional and municipal authorities will also talk about the relevant issues in this case.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: I think it is obvious not only for us, but for all observers, that an enormous amount of work – and high-quality work, as we saw today – has been carried out. The truth of this statement will be tested as we use the Olympic facilities and infrastructure. I hope that it will stand. Anyway, today it looks that way: the amount of work is clear and the quality is very good. Of course we all know this, and I do too, so why did I come here now?
A little over two months remain in the run-up to the Olympics. Still, as I already said, and you confirmed, there are some things that must be completed and polished. With such large-scale events the final stage is always the most difficult. A great deal during the Olympic Games will depend on how you pass this stage, on how we pass it together.
But before the Olympics we have New Year’s holidays and then Christmas. I want to tell you and I think this will be clear: for you the New Year begins the day the Paralympic Games end, on March 17. Your New Year will begin on March 18 – yours and that of everyone who works at Olympic venues. It is necessary that all those engaged in work to implement this large-scale – and I would even say grandiose – project understand this. I want you to work accordingly during the final stages of preparations for the Olympic Games.
