At a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation member countries, heads of state of observer countries, high representatives and summit guests,
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has been working for more than a decade now and has achieved some big results. It has established its place as an influential international organisation and plays an important part in global and regional politics.
In outlining our plans for the upcoming future, we need to take particular account of the processes underway in the global economy and international politics.
As you know, the G20 summit took place in St Petersburg just last week. We had substantial discussions of important issues such as speeding up global economic growth, creating new jobs, spreading the use of advanced technology, social sector financing, and developing high value-added production.
The measures and policy outlines the G20 has produced, and which it is my duty to inform you about, have practical interest for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Implementing them would help to make our economies stronger and more competitive.
”The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has achieved some big results. It has established its place as an influential international organisation and plays an important part in global and regional politics.“
Of course, we cannot separate economic issues from the situation in international politics. As you have already noted, Syria is at the centre of attention right now. We consider unacceptable any external military intervention in Syria’s affairs without the United Nations Security Council’s sanction.
The latest diplomatic efforts have helped to lower the immediate threat of a military operation. The initiative to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control is very important in this respect. Reports are coming in that Syria’s representative in the United Nations has announced that Syria wishes to become as from today a full-fledged party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I think we should welcome this decision by the Syrian government. I hope that this will be a real step towards resolving the Syrian crisis. It confirms our Syrian partners’ serious intent to take this road.
In this context, close cooperation within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and a firm commitment to the rule of the norms and principles of international law and the UN’s leading role in global affairs are more important than ever today.
Restoring stability in Afghanistan is one of the biggest issues on the SCO’s agenda. We welcome the Afghan government’s efforts to promote national reconciliation and make preparations for the 2014 presidential election.
We are following attentively the process of transferring responsibility for the country’s security to Afghanistan’s law enforcement and security agencies. We see how much the Afghan government is doing to ensure that these agencies will be ready to take on this responsibility and meet the security challenges that the country faces today. 
We are pleased to see Iran’s willingness to give its nuclear programme greater transparency. We believe that Iran, like any other country, has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including enrichment.
”Restoring stability in Afghanistan is one of the biggest issues on the SCO’s agenda. We welcome the Afghan government’s efforts to promote national reconciliation.“
Colleagues, it is important to continue building up our economic cooperation within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We need to increase our reciprocal trade, technology exchanges, and investment. We need to develop joint projects in agriculture and environmental protection.
In this respect we are working actively with the People’s Republic of China, given all of the trans-border issues we need to deal with. All of these areas of cooperation are open to the SCO observer countries and dialogue partners too.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Business Council has the mission of helping to expand direct contacts between our companies and business communities. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Interbank Consortium is a good example of multilateral cooperation in this area. It makes a big contribution to supporting joint infrastructure projects, spreading the use of resource-saving technology, and expanding use of our national currencies in mutual settlements. Events
Meeting with President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
Vladimir Putin met with President of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.

With President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, once again, thank you for giving us this chance to work here. This always involves a lot of effort. 
At the same time, the very fact that such a big international event with so many countries and leaders attending is taking place here, under your leadership, is evidence that Kyrgyzstan’s and your personal influence are increasing.
The summit was a success, was well organised and produced results. We signed some important documents today. I am sure that this will benefit Kyrgyzstan too, given that it is the countries in this region, this region in which we live, and with which we have the closest trade, economic and political relations, that are taking part.
Thank you very much for organising this work.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: I am happy to see you here, Mr Putin.
You came here last September, came again in May and now this September too. We would like of course, and I think all of our people would agree, that you come twice a year, in September and May at the least, more often if you wish, in summer or winter too. We are always happy to see you, happy whenever our friends from Russia come to visit.
Russia is our strategic partner. Our country has gone in one direction and another, but now is set on a firm course that is in our genes you could say. I always say that Kyrgyzstan is our homeland, but our ancestral home is the Yenisei, the Altai Mountains. Everything there is close to us too.
I am pleased to see you, and all of our people are happy at this visit. You remember that last time you came we went to the Ala Archa Gorge. That immediately set off a real boom and brought more money into the area. In other words, it would be good to visit a few tourism spots. If you visited these places it would be a boost for Kyrgyzstan’s tourism industry. 
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for the invitation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am very pleased to have this chance to meet with you on the sidelines of the SCO
summit to discuss our bilateral relations.
As you know, we follow the situation in Afghanistan closely and we sincerely wish you success. You have the presidential election coming up ahead, and also the final withdrawal by the international coalition forces. This is putting Afghanistan in the spotlight. We realise how much of a burden this places on you.
Regrettably, we have seen something of a decrease in our economic relations, and this is something I want to talk about today. 
In the security area, we continue to support Afghanistan’s army and are supplying some types of weapon, on a free-of-charge basis in some cases, as well as ammunition, and we are also training your specialists at Russian military academies.
We know that you have ahead the very difficult task of stabilising the domestic political situation and ensuring that your armed forces and law enforcement agencies will be up to the task of taking on responsibility for the situation in the country.
President of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai
(translated from Russian): Your Excellency President Putin,
The Russian Federation has followed the situation in Afghanistan over the last decade and is helping and supporting our country very much. Our relations have improved and grown stronger.
These last ten years have been an exceptional time for Afghanistan, and the Russian Federation Government understands the situation there well.
Afghanistan’s armed forces are growing stronger all the time and are capable of protecting Afghanistan and its people. In general, where Afghanistan’s armed forces are taking part and ensuring stability, there are greater guarantees of peace and security.
In 7–8 months’ time, Afghanistan will hold a presidential election and there will be a new president. I am more than confident that he will also support relations with the Russian Federation. We have two or three candidates running for the office of president, and one of them is here with us today.
Regarding trade between Russia and Afghanistan, our bilateral trade has dropped in recent years. I am a little worried by this and am sure that trade relations between our two countries could be a lot better.
A high-level delegation from Russia visited Afghanistan recently. I met with them and spoke with them. I support better trade and economic relations between Russia and Afghanistan.
As for Afghanistan’s armed forces, we need the Russian Federation’s help and we ask for your assistance and support.

With President of Iran Hassan Rouhani.
The two presidents discussed a broad range of bilateral cooperation matters and possible roads to resolving complicated international issues.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, friends, my greetings to you all.
We are very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the SCO
summit. Let me congratulate you personally on your election as President of Iran and wish you success.
We know how the Iranian nuclear issue has become such a focus of attention in world affairs today, but we in Russia also know that Iran is our country’s good neighbour, and one does not choose one’s neighbours. There has always been considerable cooperation between our countries and this will no doubt continue to be so.
We have the chance today to discuss international issues and bilateral matters, including our economic ties. Our relations are developing steadily at all different levels.
I am pleased to have this chance to meet with you in person.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani
(translated from Russian): Mr President,
First of all, thank you for your message of congratulations on my election as president, and also for sending your high representative to attend the inauguration ceremony.
Russia is our big neighbour and our relations with your country have always been a focus of particular attention from all our governments. The current government wants to expand and develop these relations. 
Today, we have the opportunity to exchange views on our bilateral agenda, sensitive regional issues, and international affairs too. We think that the more active the consultations between our countries on regional issues, especially given the sensitive situation in the Middle East, the more this will help to resolve these problems. 
As for the Iranian nuclear programme, we seek a speedy resolution to this problem within the framework of international law. Russia has taken important steps in this area in the past, and now there is an excellent opportunity for you to take new steps.
The Russian Federation’s initiative on Syria and the steps the Syrian government has taken give us hope that we will be able to avoid a new war in the region.
