With President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I am very happy to see you, Mr Khadjimba.
We constantly keep in touch: I recall your visit to Moscow and Sochi. I will not mention the special nature of our relations, which are developing. I suppose there are certain matters that require separate consideration. Our contractual legal base is becoming sounder, and practical cooperation is developing in all areas, including the economy and security.
The scope of our relations is quite vast – I am referring to its diversified nature. I am very happy to have this opportunity to discuss all these matters with you.
President of Abkhazia Raul Khadjimba
: Thank you. I am also happy to see you today.
Many things have changed in the relations between our two countries since our previous meeting – we have signed a number of sectoral agreements to develop our principal treaty. There are certain security matters that we are resolving, as well as economic and social issues.
We have already launched the process of raising the pensions of the Russian Federation citizens residing on the territory of Abkhazia, and there are certain achievements in the work of our culture ministries and law enforcement agencies.
I believe these developments should be intensified and they will receive further support.
