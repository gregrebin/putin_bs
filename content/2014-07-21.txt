Meeting on socio-economic development in Samara Region.
Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
I met recently with Governor Nikolai Merkushkin, and he briefed me on Samara Region’s problems and spoke about the steps the region plans to take. It was his proposal that we meet here in this broader format so as to hear the views of those working directly in the region, people involved in concrete business here, so as to get the attention not just of colleagues at the regional level, the regional authorities, but also the attention of the Government and the Presidential Executive Office in order to not simply analyse what is happening but also reach agreement on the immediate steps needed to take the situation to a new quality level and develop new jobs and improve infrastructure and the business climate. This is something we are working on all around the country, but I think that Samara should be one of the leaders here because it is among the top ten Russian regions in terms of industrial development level.
Mr Merkushkin and I were trying to recall earlier today what year the song Samara-Gorodok [Little town Samara] dates from. Samara already long since ceased to be a little town and is big city and industrial centre nowadays. The entire Samara region stands out for its developed industry and its amount of high value-added production. It is very pleasing to see how the cluster approach is being taken in developing the economy. This is reflected in the particular focus on promising sectors such as the aerospace and aircraft manufacturing sectors, the automotive industry, chemicals and petrochemicals. These are all sectors with a high degree of value-added production and processing.
Of course, the environment in which businesses in these sectors operate is very important when dealing with this kind of industrial production. Let’s discuss all of this today and try to formulate the needed conclusions.
In other regions, we and our Government colleagues have been doing this kind of work on a regular basis and in general have produced good results. This is because these meetings give us the chance to talk, discuss the issues with the people directly involved in production, and then make the needed adjustments at the regional and federal levels in order to help you in your specific work.

Statement by President of Russia Vladimir Putin
July 21, 2014
01:40
Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region
Statement by President of Russia Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin called for all parties to the conflict in Ukraine to ensure the necessary conditions for conducting a full investigation into the crash of the Malaysia Airlines plane.
Vladimir Putin: In response to the terrible tragedy that took place over Donetsk, I want to reiterate Russia’s position with regard to the current situation in Ukraine.
We have called repeatedly on all parties to the conflict to stop the bloodshed immediately and begin negotiations. I believe that if military operations had not resumed in eastern Ukraine on June 28, this tragedy probably could have been avoided.
At the same time, no one should and no one has the right to use this tragedy to pursue their own political goals. Rather than dividing us, tragedies of this sort should bring people together. All those who are responsible for the situation in the region must take greater responsibility before their own peoples and before the peoples of the countries whose citizens were killed in this disaster.
Everything possible must be done to ensure that international experts can work in safety at the crash site. Representatives from the Donbass region, Donetsk, Ukraine’s Emergency Situations Ministry, and Malaysian experts are already working at the site, but this is not enough. 
It is essential that a full-fledged group of experts under ICAO aegis, an appropriate international commission set up for the task, be able to work at the crash site. We must do everything possible to ensure their complete and guaranteed safety and provide them with the humanitarian corridors they need for their work. 
For its part, Russia will do everything within its power to move the conflict in eastern Ukraine from the military phase we see today to the negotiating phase, with the parties using peaceful and diplomatic means alone.

Vladimir Putin: Hello friends,
Just recently, Russia conducted a major, large-scale project – perhaps the biggest project in our recent history: the Olympic Games in Sochi. We did this very well, holding the Olympics at the highest level. And today, we can say that our athletic results were as good as we expected.
Now, we are starting implementation of a new, no less major project – preparing for the Football World Cup in 2018. I am confident that we will also carry it out at the highest level. A wonderful location has been selected here in your city for building the future stadium.
I must say that this project will allow us to show many of our cities to the world and will develop infrastructure in our cities, including transport, hotel, and communications infrastructure. We will need to do a great deal in order to lift our cities to a new level – including your wonderful city.
I hope this project will leave a wonderful legacy, allowing us not only to showcase the talent of our high-level athletes, our football players, but also allowing young athletes, such as the ones standing across from me, to build their athletic future, to be involved in sports and physical culture – not occasionally, but every day.
I want to wish success to our construction workers. Onward!
