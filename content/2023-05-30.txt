President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Everything is very interesting and promising.
Please briefly summarise everything and give it to Ms Chupsheva. We will try to review it with our colleagues in the Government.
Almost every area you represent and promote has a future. Each area is of interest and deserves support from the state. I do promise you that we will analyse every area.
I cannot say for now to what extent your plans will be realised, or more precisely, your expectations will be met, but we will try to do our best. Again, everything is very interesting and impressive.
