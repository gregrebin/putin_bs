President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
Today, we bid a final farewell to former Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov. As you know, he was known as an ‘experienced manager,’ and that is what he was, and not just that, he was a brilliant man and a Russian politician on a national scale.
He did a lot for the development of Russia’s capital city during the country’s most troubled times. He was obviously a person of his time and his era, which he created together with other participants in this complicated process.
I ask the Moscow Mayor’s office and the Government of the Russian Federation to submit proposals on eternalising the memory of Yury Luzhkov.
