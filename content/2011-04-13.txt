President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President, I am very pleased to see you again.
I am glad to welcome you and want to say two things: first, I want to wish you a happy birthday, as I know it was your birthday yesterday, and it is good that you can continue to celebrate it together with us today. 
South Africa’s presence as a member of the now enlarged BRICS group is very significant for our forum and for your country. I wish you utmost success in this respect.
I want to discuss with you today the current state of bilateral relations between Russia and South Africa. You visited Russia not so long ago and we outlined on that occasion the blueprint for developing our economic cooperation and international coordination. Of course with the current upheavals taking place on the African continent, we are all watching developments in the north of Africa very closely.
You just recently led a mediation mission to try to find a solution to the situation in Libya. I certainly very much want to exchange views with you on the events there, and the possible solutions you see to this complicated conflict. I think that settling this conflict and many others too, will depend on how well we coordinate our actions. Therefore, if you have no objection, these are the issues I would like to discuss with you today.
Once more, I greet you most warmly.
President of South Africa Jacob Zuma
: Thank you very much, your Excellency, thank you very much, Mr President, for your warm welcome.
Firstly, we meet again. We met last year in Russia when I paid a state visit, which was very successful, so thank you very much for meeting me again and thank you very much for saying something about my birthday. I realise I’m between a young man and an old man, my age puts me there, so I’m very balanced at the moment age-wise. But thank you very much.
I also agree on the issues you have raised to me to talk about; I am very happy to talk about those issues. I might add one or two small ones that I believe would be important to talk about. One of them being the scientific development. Our country is bidding for this Square Kilometre Array which we are coordinating with other countries in the continent, [it is] very important. I would like to add that one on the agenda. And I’m sure we could look at other issues, but otherwise the agenda is agreed. Thank you very much.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Prime Minister, I greet you most warmly.
It is a great pleasure to see you once more. I was in India not so long ago on a visit that was very useful and productive, and, as always, very friendly.
Today we are meeting for the BRIC – now enlarged to become BRICS – summit, and this gives us the chance to not only assess the current international economic situation and review international events, but also examine our bilateral relations, which makes me very happy. We can discuss economic matters, our cooperation on humanitarian projects and our ties in other areas too. It is a very good thing that we are opening the year with this meeting.
Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh: Mr President,

Visit to India
December 21 − 22, 2010
India and Russia have a unique strategic and global partnership. We completed the decade of strategic cooperation, and I dare say it is an occasion to celebrate, because in this decade our relations have gained in strength, in durability, in depth and width. And a great deal has been due to the activities, Mr President, you have taken in the development of these relations. And I thank you and Mr Putin from the core of my heart, for the strong support that you have given to intensification of our cooperation in almost every conceivable activity that we could think of. And I do hope, the next decade will be still more productive in terms of promoting cooperation between our two countries.
And BRICS is also an institution which has got its institutional shape because of the fiery zeal of Russian leadership. The first time that BRICS met as a group was in Russia, and last year we met in Brazil, and now we are meeting in China, and in these three years the world has changed enormously. The world economy has been faced with numerous challenges and the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that partnership of countries like Russia, China, India, Brazil and now South Africa can strengthen the forces of peace, progress and stability.
So once again I express my great sense of joy and glee in your company. Your visit in December was a landmark and whenever I meet you I know back there in Russia we have a top leadership which is exceedingly supportive of our ambitions.

President of The People’S Republic of China Hu Jintao
(retranslated): Mr President,
It is a great pleasure to see you once again. First of all, I want to wish you a warm welcome to the third BRICS summit, and also to the opening session of the 2011 Boao Forum for Asia. 
”Our countries are strategic partners. I hope that over the coming few days we will take new steps to further advance our relations as good neighbours and partners.“
Last year, as I recall well, we met six times and had a substantial exchange of views on relevant issues. I think this did much in general to deepen the strategic partnership and cooperation between our two countries and develop cooperation in all different areas.
This year, I am ready to join my efforts to yours, Mr President, to continue expanding and promoting strong and stable relations between Russia and China.
I give you the floor, Mr President.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President,
It is a real pleasure to meet with you again. This is our first meeting this year, and I and my delegation are all very happy to be here on Hainan for the BRICS summit and the economic forum.
Our countries are strategic partners, and this is reflected in the economy of course, and also in our political coordination and discussion of current issues on the international agenda. I hope that over the coming few days we will take new steps to further advance our relations as good neighbours and partners.
