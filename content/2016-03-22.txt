Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region
With President of Finland Sauli Niinistö.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, let me warmly welcome you to Moscow.
We are meeting today to discuss our bilateral relations in the first place. However, taking into account the tragic events that unfolded in Belgium, we should first express our condolences to the victims' families and friends.
We have discussed the problems with fighting terrorism on many occasions, and we can effectively fight it only if we join our efforts. We will, of course, discuss this issue today as well.
Welcome!
President of Finland Sauli Niinistö (in Russian): Thank you very much. It is always a pleasure to come to Moscow.
(Retranslated): True, the events that happened today in Belgium shocked the world, shocked all of us, and we share the pain and grief of the Belgian people. These events only stress the fact you just mentioned – it is only by joining our efforts that we can fight terrorism.
