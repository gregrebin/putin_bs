With Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, it gives me great pleasure to see you in Russia, this time in Vladivostok.
This morning I met with business leaders, including those from Japan, who work in Russia and the Russian Far East. Of course, it is very important to give political support to the business community’s plans to develop bilateral ties.
We have resumed our relationships at foreign ministry level, and we are analysing the proposals you made during your visit to Sochi.
Thank you for coming to Russia, where you are welcome.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): First, I would like to thank you, Vladimir, for your hospitality in Sochi.
Indeed, we had a very productive meeting there, and I am glad that I have been able to honour my promise to come to Vladivostok at your invitation.
I congratulate you on the second Eastern Economic Forum. The Russian Far East has a huge potential and, as far as I know, developing this region is one of Russia’s priorities.
The development of the Asia Pacific region is driving the global economy. The Far Eastern region is important for boosting the development of Japan and Russia because it offers an opportunity for collective work. Vladivostok is the gate to this objective.
I believe that holding this international forum here was well timed. I respect the Russian President’s decision to hold it. Japan is willing to provide any assistance it can. As a neighbouring country, Japan is willing to do its best to further develop cooperation with Russia in this region.
We have been preparing for Vladimir’s visit to Japan since our last meeting, and I am glad to say that this work is going on as planned.
Today I am ready to exchange opinions on a broad range of issues and on the development of bilateral relations as a whole.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Shinzo.
