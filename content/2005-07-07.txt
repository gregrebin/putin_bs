President Vladimir Putin: As you know, an immense crime has been committed in London today.
In this respect, I would like to say that Russia, too, has confronted terrorism on many occasions, has confronted cruel and bloody crimes that have taken the lives of hundreds of innocent people, our citizens.
It is for precisely this reason that people in Russia, like nowhere else, are so profoundly affected by what has happened, feel such sympathy for the victims and send their condolences. But also todayâ€™s events are yet another confirmation that we are all doing too little to unite our efforts to fight terrorism in the most effective way possible. I would like to express not only the hope, but also the confidence that the international community will abandon all double standards with regard to atrocious crimes such as those committed today in London and will find every possible solution and make every possible effort to counter terrorism, to fight it together and to find within itself the resolve to eradicate entirely and for good this scourge of the twenty-first century.
