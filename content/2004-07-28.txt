Opening Address at a Senior Officers Presentation Ceremony

The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear comrades!
I congratulate you on your appointments and awards of higher military and special ranks. This is a high assessment by the state of your work and services. And, of course, it is a great sign of confidence in you to serve in the most responsible areas, to protect the security of Russia and its citizens. I want to sincerely wish you success in solving the tasks that your departments face. I would like to stress right away that the reliable provision of national security is a very important condition of the gradual and stable development of Russia.
In recent years, we have done a great deal together to consolidate the Armed Forces and other law-enforcement structures of the state.
The major training exercises held this year have shown the increased level of battle training of army and navy personnel. I would ask that improving the quality and intensity of military training of the troops would be given priority attention in future as well.
One of the key issues of military organisation is still forming an effective system of social protection of servicemen and their families.
We must properly carry out all our decisions on moving to a mortgage system to solve military personnel's accommodation problems, which starts next year. And more attention should be given to improving the system of military education, and reform of higher military schools.
It must be clearly understood that all these steps serve one main goal: to consolidate the staff and to increase the prestige of military service, which means increasing the battle readiness of our Armed Forces.
Dear comrades,
Today, both Russia and the international community as a whole are facing serious security threats. These threats are well-known: terrorism, organised crime, the circulation of drugs, and illegal migration. To effectively oppose these challenges, it is necessary to ensure excellent coordination and effectiveness of action among all the participants of this process, and all law-enforcement departments. The recent bandit attack on Ingushetia and the terrorist acts in the Chechen republic show that extremists and their supporters are prepared to use any means to destabilise the situation in our country. The heads of this law-enforcement bloc must make serious conclusions from these events, and give an objective evaluation of the actions of their subordinates, and take all measures to reliably ensure security of the country and citizens.
Work should also be completed as soon as possible on improving the security system in regions which require special attention from law-enforcement structures. It is extremely important to coordinate more precise and effective cooperation between the FSB, Interior Ministry and Defence Ministry. In connection with this, I think the decision is appropriate to strengthen units and sub-units of internal forces with experienced Army officers.
Improving operative work has enormous importance. Your task is not just to respond to terrorist acts and attacks, but above all to prevent them.
Reliable information is a sound basis for making strategic decisions by the state. International and domestic realities make new, higher demands on the analytical and operative work of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.
Among the priorities of the Federal Security Service, along with neutralising the intelligence work of foreign special services, are ensuring the economic and financial security of the country, and fighting organised criminal groups.
The Russian Interior Ministry must also move as soon as possible to a new organisation and staff structure. I would like to remind you that since the functions of the tax police were transferred to the Interior Ministry, the resources of the internal affairs bodies have significantly increased in uncovering crimes in the economic sphere. I would ask you to give special attention to the suppression of corruption, and the protection of business, especially medium and small business, from criminal pressure.
Last year showed that the drug control bodies are able to solve serious tasks in opposing the illicit drugs threat. But these are only the first steps. It is necessary to gradually increase efforts in opposing drug addiction and the fight on drug crime. This concerns the health and the very lives of millions of our fellow citizens. And furthermore, it must not be forgotten that enormous illegal financial activity is hidden behind the drug trade. A significant amount of these funds goes towards financing extremist and terrorist threats.
Opposing crime, terrorism, and the drug threat directly depends on reliable protection of our borders, and the effectiveness of our migration policy.
The FSB Border Service must therefore develop modern methods of protecting the state border, combining military and operational resources.
A very important task for the Russian Interior Ministry Federal Migration Service is to prevent illegal migration. Today, this is increasingly under the control of international organised crime. Illegal migration channels are actively used by both terrorists and drug lords.
However, at the same time we must all understand: it is not possible, it is not right to put barriers in the path of people who respect the law and come to Russia to live and work honestly. And so we must continue to form a civilised migration policy. A policy that corresponds to international norms and the long-term economic interests of our country.
And finally, Russian Emergency Ministry employees do very important work. They are responsible for efficient liquidation of emergency situations and providing humanitarian aid. Along with this, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on preventing man-made catastrophes, and on wide preventive work.
And in conclusion, I would like to stress once more: the security of Russia and her citizens depends directly on you, and your responsibility for the tasks you have been charged with.
And I wish you success in serving your country, and good health and prosperity to you and your families.
Thank you.

Concluding Remarks at the Senior Officers Presentation Ceremony
July 28, 2004
19:51
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear comrades,
Officers and generals,
We have gathered in the Kremlin on the occasion of conferment of higher officer ranks and on your appointment to new positions â€“ in this beautiful ceremonial hall, the hall of Russia's military glory.
But we all know that unfortunately, our country does not yet look as beautiful as the Kremlin Georgievsky Hall.
Russia faces many problems of a political and economic nature, and of opposing criminal encroachments on the lives and health of our citizens, and on the country's security.
Russia is opening up to the world, and this process will continue. In receiving all the advantages from integration into the world's economy, the world's humanitarian sphere, we also encounter all the problems that the world faces. And unlike many other countries in the world, we are not yet sufficiently ready to effectively combat these problems. We are not ready for a whole range of reasons. But we have no other path besides Russia's integration into the international community, although on the other hand we can not allow criminals and terrorists, the people who want to destroy our country, to walk all over us, because otherwise all our efforts will become meaningless. And to stop this from happening, we must increase political stability in the country, and increase efforts in the growth of the economy, and solve social tasks effectively. But without an effectively functioning mechanism of law-enforcement bodies, we will not solve these tasks either.
The methods and means that we must find and choose to solve the tasks that lie before us in this sphere must be adequate to the threats that the country faces.
It is impossible to calculate and see everything down to the last detail in advance while sitting in the Kremlin, the White House or any other major centres. A great deal depends on you, on the people who must sense the situation more professionally in every area that is entrusted to you. And not just to sense it, but to react with talent and initiative to everything that happens in these spheres. I expect you to work with initiative. And of course, to work in the spirit that has always been characteristic of the Russian army and Russian law-enforcement bodies, in the spirit of selfless service to your duty and your people.
I congratulate you once more and wish you all the very best.
