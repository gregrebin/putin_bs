A number of bilateral documents were also signed during the official visit by the President of Angola to Russia. Specifically, intergovernmental agreements on the peaceful exploration and use of space and on fishery and aquaculture were signed, as well as documents on cooperation in diamond mining and processing.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, It is a pleasure to see you and to welcome you to Moscow.
We met in Johannesburg last year, and I am happy to welcome you to Moscow in your capacity as the head of state.
With President of Angola Joao Lourenco.
You are well acquainted with our country, because you studied here, and I hope you will find it both interesting and pleasant to see how Moscow and Russia have changed.
Angola is a reliable and old partner. We need to consider what we need to do without delay to stimulate our trade and economic ties.
There are interesting fields of activity, such as the diamond industry, fisheries and space exploration. There are also cultural spheres, such as education and the training of personnel.
We are happy to see you. Welcome to Moscow.
President of Angola Joao Lourenco (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you for receiving me and the accompanying delegation in Moscow. As you have said correctly, it is true that I have noticed how much Russia has improved over these years, since 1982, when I completed my education in Moscow.
Moscow then and now are two different cities. My congratulations – you have ensured progress and development for Russia and the Russian people.
President of Angola Joao Lourenco.
We have come to Russia on an official visit to strengthen our ties and cooperation and, if possible, to promote interaction between our countries.
Russia is doing splendidly in the spheres of mineral resources, education, healthcare and defence. But we would like to know about Russia’s potential in other fields so we can promote cooperation in these areas of the Angolan economy.
This is why my speech at the opening of the Angola-Russia Forum in Moscow yesterday was designed to attract the interest of Russian business people to investing in the Angolan economy.
Many countries are doing this, and we are confident that Russia can help with economic diversification.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I think that this year we will have an opportunity to continue our dialogue aimed at finding ways to strengthen our economic ties. On October 24 of this year, a major Russia-Africa Forum will be held in Sochi. We hope to see you there.
Joao Lourenco: I will be happy to attend it.

Vladimir Putin spoke at the Memory Watch 2019 plenary meeting and learned about the Russian Search Movement’s projects, including the Frontline Portrait: A Soldier’s Destiny, which presents 27 portraits of Red Army soldiers that were painted at the frontline.
This nationwide event, due to last until April 6, will involve over 250 representatives of search associations from 82 Russian regions. They will discuss preparations for celebrating the 75th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, the implementation of the state patriotic education programme for young people and the organisation of search projects in 2019.
Memory Watch 2019 includes a number of events, such as search expeditions, caring for military burial sites, holding exhibitions and patriotic events linked with perpetuating the memory of the Motherland’s defenders who were killed in action.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, veterans,
I congratulate you all on the beginning of a new Memory Watch event. First of all, I would like to congratulate the veterans I can see here, who are the most distinguished and most important guests of all meetings of members of the Russian search movement.
Your heroic generation defended and rebuilt our country, liberated the entire world from Nazism, and your sacred devotion to the Motherland and your moral strength inspire participants in the search movement, as well as many others. This inspires all of us to staunchly defend the truth about the Great Patriotic War and the immortal feat of our people, and reminds us of the need to defend our national interests and those of the people of Russia.
In all, 250 members of the search movement from 80 Russian regions have gathered here. This impressive line-up is hardly surprising: this year your traditional assembly has coincided with the organisation’s fourth convention.
Its agenda aims to sum up the results of your work and to prepare for celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory and, what is also very important, it includes a detailed discussion of a draft state patriotic education programme.
Memory Watch 2019 national event plenary meeting.
The current programme is to expire in 2020, and I am confident that the convention’s delegates will help chart priorities of the programme’s next edition.
The involvement of search movement members in drafting and implementing this document has great significance. It is you who discover previously unknown facts and events of our military history, reinstate the names of this country’s heroes and their destinies, as well as those great examples of genuine patriotism that should be used to raise and educate the new generations of Russian citizens.
I have repeatedly said, and I want to note this once again: history’s inseparable continuity is a foundation for our sustained movement. These values consolidate and unite our society.
We must do everything possible so that today’s children, teenagers, young people and all Russian citizens take pride in the fact that they are the heirs, the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the victors, so that they know the heroes of their country and, what is most important, know the heroes of their own families, and everyone would realise that this is part of our life.
The memory of the difficult and heroic war years and everyone who brought closer the victorious hour in 1945 is absolutely sacred for our people. And your personal contribution to its preservation is very meaningful for Russia.
At this point, I would like to highlight the educational aspect of your work, your educational initiatives. Working on the sites of past battles, you are restoring sincere, truthful history.
It is this truth without any embellishments that always goes to your heart and soul and finds a response in the hearts of all generations, including young people, our youth. It is no accident that your projects are truly in demand.
At the plenary meeting of the Memory Watch 2019 national event.
Scouts are playing a great role in preserving the common historical memory of the peoples of the world. It is enough to mention your friendship and close cooperation with your foreign colleagues who know and honour the feat of the liberator soldiers.
And, of course, I would like to make special mention of the Great Victory Achieved by Unity project aimed at enhancing cooperation of search teams in the former Soviet republics.
The results of the search movement participants’ work and your very attitude to work certainly deserve all-round support. The movement will continue to enjoy organisational and grant support and necessary conditions will be created for your consistent and coordinated activities.
In the near future, experts will start elaborating a state programme on immortalising the memory of those who died defending our Motherland. Its goal is to regulate all legal aspects of the search movement, including assistance from government bodies of all levels.
I would like to emphasise that all issues related to befitting memorialisation of the Great Patriotic War heroes and Nazi victims should be resolved.
Friends,
I would like to congratulate you again on the beginning of Memory Watch. I wish you success and all the best. Thank you very much for your efforts and your attention.
