President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, colleagues.
It gives me great pleasure to greet you here. I have just recently visited the People’s Republic of China, were our Chinese friends hosted the APEC Summit. I would like to congratulate them on this. I think the Summit was organised on the highest level. We had some very frank conversations, and here we will have the opportunity to continue the conversations we began in Beijing.
I would like to say that I consider our meetings within the G20 framework to be very useful and important because they give us a chance to compare notes regarding the enormous flow of information and our positions on world trade, the global financial situation, our common actions to improve the situation in the global economy, giving consideration to the interests of the actively developing economies as well.
I would like to note in this connection that we are successfully implementing the decisions to create dedicated financial institutions within BRICS. Madam President [of Brazil Dilma Rouseff] referred to it earlier. We are finalising the creation of the Development Bank and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement, which were founded at the summit in Fortaleza. They have a significant total capital of $200 billion. This will provide us with common mechanisms capable of stabilising national capital markets in case of crisis situations in the global economy. Meanwhile, new joint lending opportunities will make it possible to expand our trade and economic ties.
It is important that ties between our five states are expanding in other areas as well. Thus, our cooperation in industry and technology is becoming more efficient. New joint projects have evolved in such areas as energy, mineral resources production and processing, agro-industry and high technology. We also share a common stand on information security and exchange experience in resolving acute social issues and in developing agriculture, education and science.
Friends and colleagues, in April 2015 Russia will take over the Presidency in BRICS. Our efforts will be directed at a further expansion of cooperation within our association. Russia is drafting a strategy for our economic partnership and an investment cooperation roadmap.
Friends, I would like to invite you all to the Russian city of Ufa on July 8–9, 2015 for another joint effort. We will prepare for the event together.

Meeting with participants in the Labour 20 Summit.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, friends.
We met with some of you in St Petersburg last year. I am very happy to see this tradition of contacts between heads of state and government and world trade union leaders continue.
Last year, as you may know, we organised a meeting of labour and finance ministers. Unfortunately, this year our host Australia did not arrange meetings in this format. Nevertheless, Australia remains true to tradition and has placed the employment issue on the agenda.
Naturally, we all proceed from the notion that it is impossible to find cardinal solutions to employment issues without the participation of trade unions. In Russia, we maintain regular close contacts with our leading trade unions within the framework of a trilateral commission. We have already signed more than 190 labour agreements covering over 90 percent of the working population.
We also have great plans in this area. We have set ourselves the task of creating 25 million up-to-date jobs. Unemployment in Russia is at a relatively low level of 5.2 percent.
In short, I am very happy to see you and to hear your views regarding our joint efforts and the organisation of cooperation.

Beginning of meeting with Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Renzi
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President.
I would like to recall my visit to Milan and thank you for your hospitality. There have not been many developments since then, but considering our relations, we always have something to talk about. I am very happy to have a separate meeting with you on the sidelines the G20 Summit.
Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Renzi (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President. I also believe that our meeting in Milan was important for all of us. In particular, it was important for relations between Europe and Asia, which are of a fundamental, strategic significance and should develop further. It was also our first meeting since I was appointed Prime Minister of Italy.
I hope that meeting helped us make headway on the issues that remain open between Russia and the European Union, particularly with regard to Ukraine.
I would like our further dialogue to continue in the spirit of our Milan meeting. I also hope that we will be able to meet during EXPO, which will also take place in Milan in May 2015.
In this connection, I would like to hear your opinion of the developments and the meetings that took place over the past weeks. I know you held important meetings within the APEC Summit in Beijing. I would like to hear what you think of the outcome of those events and your assessment of the developments in Ukraine and around it.
