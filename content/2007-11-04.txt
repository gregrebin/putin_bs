Vladimir Putin:
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen!
Dear friends!
Today we are gathered once again to celebrate National Unity Day. This holiday is undoubtedly linked with Russia's destiny and that of each of its citizens. Its origins go back deep into the centuries-long history of our state. And we certainly share this holiday with our compatriots abroad. I would like to offer all of you my warmest congratulations on this significant occasion!
I am glad to see those who participated in the first Russian World Assembly that was held in Moscow yesterday at our celebration today. Your meeting demonstrated, once again, just how wide and varied the Russian world is, a world with millions of inhabitants, as well as its enormous creative potential. You are well aware that in order to help us develop this potential a homonymous fund has been created. It is designed to help compatriots' organisations, to support and promote Russian language and the culture of the peoples of Russia throughout the world.
Dear friends!
November 4th is an important date in history. On this very day a long time ago, in 1612, at the foot of the Kremlin's walls we celebrated more than simply a victory over foreign invaders. Thanks to the unity displayed by the multinational people of Russia we managed to end the many years of troubles and internal strife. It was the way Russian society rallied together and the responsibility it took for the country's destiny that allowed us to defend our independence and renew Russian statehood. We created the conditions to construct and establish an enormous great power, stretching from the Baltic to the Pacific Ocean. Without a doubt, authentic patriotic actions by Russian citizens have constituted the might and power of our people over many centuries. They have promoted unfailing spiritual values that are transferred to generation from generation. Russian compatriots abroad continue to uphold these values and are united not only by their involvement in the history of the Motherland but also by the sincere desire to help promote Russia's well-being and prosperity today. I am pleased that today our compatriots have new opportunities to expand and strengthen their ties with Russia.
Modern Russia is strong not only because of its new economic successes or its growing influence in international affairs. Russia was and remains powerful thanks to national unity and, of course, thanks to the tremendous intellectual and creative potential of our people, talented, qualified people who sincerely desire to act for the benefit of their nation. This is the best bridge to the successful future of Russia, to reviving and strengthening our country's historic role.
Today, on this remarkable day, I would like to present the commemorative Pushkin Medal to our friends from abroad who have done a great deal to popularize the Russian language, to preserve the Russian historical and spiritual heritage and, of course, to strengthen academic and educational ties between countries, nations, and people. Let me congratulate you with all my heart, thank our prize winners for their unique contribution to cultural diplomacy, and wish them further success.
I congratulate you all once again on this nationwide holiday, National Unity Day!
Thank you very much for you attention.
