Opening remarks at the meeting with the heads of relevant agencies and international energy organisations
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends and colleagues,
I would like to sincerely welcome all of you in Moscow.
This is a good place for all who are interested in the development of global energy to meet and talk to one another in a friendly manner about common problems and ways of forward development.
This is a chance to talk not only with the heads of relevant agencies and international organisations but also with those who are directly employed in the industry. This is an opportunity to exchange views, best practices and information and to use it in practical work.
At the meeting with heads of relevant agencies and international energy organisations.
As you know, Russia has always been a highly responsible player on the global market. We are doing everything we can to balance out demand and supply in cooperation with you, and to create favourable conditions for the development of the global economy and for consumers, as well as for the advance of the industry as such.
We are responsible people and we think about the development of the world and the global energy industry, including renewable energy sources.
In addition to this, I strongly hope that you will also learn more about Russia and Moscow and will be able to spend at least a few hours enjoying this pleasant and favourable as well as friendly environment.
Thank you for being here.
