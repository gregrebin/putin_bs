With Aslan Tkhakushinov and Murat Kumpilov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Tkhakushinov, I am aware that you have found a replacement. How many years have you worked [in this position]?
Aslan Tkhakushinov
: It has been ten years, eight of which I have worked side by side with Murat Kumpilov. We achieved good economic indicators: he was in charge of the economy and on top of all the developments. We were the targets of identical anonymous letters. (Laughter.) We did our work the same way.
Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you for the work you have done in your republic.
Aslan Tkhakushinov: Thank you very much.

Vladimir Putin: You have worked responsibly, seriously, and thoroughly. Thank you very much.
Aslan Tkhakushinov: Mr President, remember, you promised to come to Adygeya, but never did.
Vladimir Putin: I will some day.
Aslan Tkhakushinov: We have built 344 new facilities, among them a stadium, a shooting range and a judo training centre named after Vladimir Nevzorov, our pupil.
Vladimir Putin: That is great. Thank you, I will definitely come.
Aslan Tkhakushinov: I am very grateful to you for always being there for us and for your continued support. I call you a perpetuum mobile. You are everywhere at any given time. I wonder how you manage to keep up such a pace. It must be sambo or judo.
Vladimir Putin: That's right.
Aslan Tkhakushinov: Our people have great respect for you and send their thank you to you.
We recommend Mr Kumpilov as a responsible and competent individual.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Kumpilov, you have lived almost all of your life in the republic, correct? You were in charge of the taxes?
Murat Kumpilov: Yes. After graduation, I worked at the Treasury, then the Taxation Service, followed by the Cabinet, where I served as Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister. Now, I am the Parliament Speaker.
Aslan Tkhakushinov: I will not be getting in his way. I will do my best to help him in every way.
Vladimir Putin: I have no doubt about it.
Aslan Tkhakushinov: We want Adygeya to be even stronger and become a benchmark republic. If not, we want to at least become fully free from subsidies. We have already reduced our dependence on them, and want to become fully independent. We have many things to accomplish, and we know we can make them happen.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
(Addressing Murat Kumpilov) There is nothing I need to tell you about the republic. You know well how things are, and you are aware of the republic’s goals in terms of development that people expect you to achieve. You have proper experience. I hope that this tandem of yours will remain intact, and you will continue to work effectively. I wish you success.
Murat Kumpilov: Mr President, thank you for your trust. I will make every effort to fulfil all of your instructions and executive orders. Of course, socioeconomic development and standard of living are high on the list of our priorities.
The team has been formed and includes our colleagues with whom we have worked for eight or nine years. We know the people, and we know the problems, so we will focus on the tasks at hand.
Thank you for your trust.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
