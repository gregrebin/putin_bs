At the memorial to the first victims of the Chernobyl disaster. With President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia.
The two heads of state attended a service at the St Elijah Church in Chernobyl commemorating the victims of the 1986 accident at the nuclear power plant. Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia held the Easter service.
Later the presidents of Russia and Ukraine took part in the ceremony of laying the first stone of the future memorial to the liquidators of the Chernobyl disaster. The monument will be erected by December 14, when Ukraine marks the Chernobyl Accident Liquidators Day.
In addition, Dmitry Medvedev and Viktor Yanukovych
visited a memorial centre, where they viewed an interactive exhibition devoted to the heroic liquidators of one of the largest man-made disasters of the 20th century.
The two leaders also laid flowers at the monument in memory of the first victims of the Chernobyl disaster, which is located directly on the accident’s site in front of the plant. The memorial is a complex of red granite slabs engraved with the names of 28 liquidators who died during the summer of 1986. Dmitry Medvedev and Viktor Yanukovych paid a tribute to the victims with a minute of silence.

Speeches at ceremony to commemorate Chernobyl disaster victims
President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych: Mr President,
Your Holiness, Your Beatitude,
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are marking a tragic date today: the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. We are remembering it together with Russia, our friend and neighbour. I am grateful to President Medvedev for joining us to share our grief.
The relief workers – Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians – in charge of the operation following the explosion at the fourth power unit 25 years ago were not divided by state borders. They were just people who fought the disaster together.
Twenty-five years have passed and we have become fully aware that man-made disasters and nuclear accidents have enormous consequences for the people living in the areas where they take place. Today the whole world has realised that such disasters have no borders: Fukushima-1 is a tragic example of this. The whole world understands now that no state can cope with such a disaster alone.

We are very grateful to all countries that took part in a conference devoted to the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl. We are grateful to Mr Medvedev for Russia’s decision to make a considerable contribution, 45 million euros, to finance the Shelter project.
I know that people who lived in the areas affected by the radioactive fallout continue to suffer to this day. Today we are doing everything we can to make their lives easier. I know that this disaster has forced many people to think in new ways and to combine their efforts in helping others in distress.
I want to emphasise once again that the cherished memory of those relief workers who participated in the clear-up operation following the Chernobyl disaster will live for generations. It will live in the grateful memory of our nations.
On this occasion we must think once again about safe operation of nuclear facilities, nuclear power stations, realising that it depends on us how safe they will be. I think the decision made at this conference to establish a research centre here in Chernobyl to prevent nuclear accidents and other man-made disasters will contribute to a future global scientific and practical framework that will serve the whole world and all of humanity.
I would like to say once again that we pay tribute to the memory of those who saved us and saved humanity. We bow our heads to them.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President,
Your Holiness, Your Beatitude,
Ladies and gentlemen,
It was probably a warm day just like today 25 years ago. The fact that today we are remembering together one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century shows how much was done to help a huge number of people to survive.
Mr Yanukovych was absolutely correct when he said just now that an enormous number of people – citizens of Ukraine, the Russian Federation and other republics – carried out hugely difficult and very necessary work to clear-up the aftermath of the accident. Unfortunately, many of those who took part in the operation lost their lives while saving others: those who continue to live today in our countries.
The accident’s consequences could have been extraordinary. They were huge in any case, but if it were not for the efforts of the liquidators, fire-fighters, rescue workers and doctors, those consequences would have been global. We must bear this in mind, especially since humanity is continuing to evolve. We have no alternative energy sources that could replace nuclear power. In fact, we probably don’t need them. The main thing is that we all realise the enormous power we are dealing with and make sure that our technological solutions meet the challenges presented by nuclear energy.
”Carried out hugely difficult and very necessary work to clear-up the aftermath of the accident. Unfortunately, many of those who took part in the operation lost their lives while saving others: those who continue to live today in our countries.“
Since then, we have implemented a wide variety of measures, learned some very difficult lessons and adopted vitally important standards. But recent tragedies, especially the tragedy in Japan, the disaster at the Fukushima-1station shows that we must make extra efforts to ensure that nuclear power remains peaceful and addresses the major problem it is intended to solve. That is why we must join our efforts to prepare a new regulatory framework that will operate across the planet.
Today I sent proposals to leaders of the largest states, our friends and partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Ukraine, of course, aimed at ensuring the positive development of nuclear energy worldwide, while at the same time preventing global catastrophic consequences. It seems there is a need to think about drafting new international conventions, and we must do it. It is our duty to the memory of those who were the first to come to the rescue of all of humanity 25 years ago.
It is impossible not to feel emotion here. It seems like there is perfect calm in the air. The spring weather is beautiful. At the same time every detail, every line of the fourth power unit has great significance for humanity. I look at these shapes, familiar from a large number of photographs and newsreels, and I understand how much human effort went into creating this station first and then preserving it. Chernobyl station employees are still keeping watch for all our sakes. Thank you for this, thank you from the Russian people and from people across the globe. Today we bow our heads in memory of those who achieved a real feat at the hardest time.
There is one more thing we must mention today. We must be honest in the face of such threats. It is a duty of every state to tell people the truth. We must admit that the state did not always behave with integrity. For such tragedies never to be repeated we must all be honest, we must provide absolutely accurate information about what is going on, wherever the events are taking place and whatever they might be. This is also one of the lessons Chernobyl has taught us.
We must do everything we can to help the liquidators, fire-fighters and labour veterans who continue to work or are receiving medical treatment.
Yesterday in the Kremlin, I presented state decorations to the people of our country and I promised to convey to you their warmest greetings, their wishes of good health and words of solidarity and sympathy on this very special day for us all.
We will always remember those who gave their lives and health to save people. Eternal memory to the heroes who laid their heads here. We bow our heads to them.

President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych
: Mr President, I want to thank you and the Russian delegation for your active participation in the events to mark the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. 
I've already talked about this and I want to reiterate that it is very important for us to ensure an unbreakable link between generations: those liquidators who saved the situation as far as it was possible 25 years ago, sacrificing their lives, and those who live now. 
A new generation has grown up in these past 25 years. The fact that we are now jointly tackling the issue of building a new sarcophagus, the creation of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (and Russia as our neighbour and partner is taking part in it), has tremendous importance for the people: for those who saved the situation many years ago and for those living today. 
Thank you very much once again. I would like us to review the most urgent issues in relations between our countries, as well as the agenda for the Russian-Ukrainian Interstate Commission meeting in June. 
Our Governments are preparing for the meeting and I am sure you have the same report on it as I do. There are some issues in which we have made great progress, and this is confirmed by the trade growth from $15 billion in 2009 to nearly $42 billion last year. This is the main result. 
”We have been tackling these problems both to eliminate all the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and to make sure that the efforts of a huge number of rescuers and firefighters had not been in vain. We will continue to cooperate on this issue.“
I know that it is difficult to be completely satisfied with one’s achievements, so we could also discuss the problems that exist today and ways to resolve them. Therefore, I would like to welcome you and to thank you, and I think that there are still many issues that we must tackle together. 
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President, this is a special day for both our nations. 
Together we have visited the place that became a symbol of a great disaster, the disaster that the people of our shared country fought shoulder to shoulder. The impact of that man-made disaster was successfully minimised due to their selfless efforts and at the cost of many lives. We paid tribute to their memory. 
I would like to say that it is our shared grief and our shared problem: it still makes itself felt not only in the Chernobyl zone which is referred to as the affected area, but unfortunately, the effects spread to other parts of Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Belarus. 
We have been tackling these problems both to eliminate all the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and to make sure that the efforts of a huge number of rescuers and firefighters had not been in vain. We will continue to cooperate on this issue, providing assistance in the construction of the new shelter and as part of programmes that we discussed. 
As for our bilateral agenda, it is as full as ever. You mentioned that interstate consultations will take place soon (in June, I believe), where we will be able to review in detail the instructions issued to our Governments and to see what has been done and what has not been done. We have plenty of subjects to discuss: there are new and unfinished projects, as well as ongoing problems that need to be addressed. 
One thing is absolutely certain: our relations have recovered from the crisis, both the crisis between our states and the economic one (unfortunately, they coincided in time), and now the level of trade is much higher, nearing its maximum ever. 
This does not mean that we have no matters to talk about. Our teams are busy but problems abound. The Russian delegation is ready for an extended discussion, and today I propose that we touch base on the most urgent topics.

Address to the nation on Chernobyl disaster anniversary
Dmitry Medvedev made an address to the nation on the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl NPP disaster.

Full text of the address:
Today is 25 years since the Chernobyl tragedy. Quarter of a century ago the world experienced a devastating man-made disaster. Millions of people were exposed to radiation, and hundreds of thousands lost their health, their homes, and a part of their homeland. Chernobyl will forever remain a symbol of a great human tragedy.
On this day we mourn the dead and commiserate with all those affected by this tragedy. We thank all the participants in the clean-up operation following the accident. They showed courage and heroism and prevented the spread of radiation.
Chernobyl is a common tragedy for Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and it is shared by the entire global community. We are currently raising funds to build a new sarcophagus for the stricken reactor. A donors’ assembly comprising 28 countries has already been established. Russia will also make its contribution by donating at least 45 million euros to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and Nuclear Safety Account within two years.
The consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident have not been totally cleared to this day, which makes it that much more painful for us to hear the news from Japan. It also makes us more aware of the paramount importance of the nuclear facilities’ safety. We must draw lessons for the future from these tragedies.
Over the years, nuclear technology has made great progress and nuclear power stations operate successfully in virtually all regions of the world. Nuclear energy remains the most cost-effective way to generate electricity. It is also the safest way, but only if relevant rules and regulations are strictly complied with.
At the G8 Summit in May Russia will present its initiatives on enhancing the safety of nuclear power. They will stipulate an increased responsibility of countries using nuclear energy, including for taking timely and adequate response measures during emergencies. We also believe that additional safety requirements must be adopted for the construction and operation of nuclear power facilities. They must be consolidated as international legal instruments and made mandatory for all states. Authorised international organisations, first of all the IAEA, will be in charge of monitoring compliance with these regulations.
It is vitally important that new nuclear power plants are built with the highest safety barriers, and that the principles of openness and absolute transparency become the norm for all nuclear facilities in the world.
