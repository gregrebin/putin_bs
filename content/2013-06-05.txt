Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin: Mr President, yesterday, I discussed the issue of holding an early mayoral election in Moscow with the Moscow City Duma deputies and representatives of the local authorities at a meeting of the Public Council.
This is the first time in the last 10 years that it is now legally possible to hold such an election, and after consultations, I decided that it would be the right thing to hold this election this year.
In this respect, Mr President, I ask you to accept my resignation ahead of term and name an acting mayor for the period until the election.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sobyanin, you have been the mayor now for the last two-and-a-half years?
Sergei Sobyanin: Slightly longer.
Vladimir Putin: You have been working successfully overall, and so I ask you to continue this work. I will sign today an executive order naming you as acting mayor until the election, and I ask you to ensure that all of the city’s services continue working without problem.
No matter what the domestic political events are going on, in a huge city like Moscow, maintaining social and public order is essential. I hope you will manage. We have been working together for a long time now and I know your abilities.
Do you plan to run in the election?
Sergei Sobyanin: Yes, Mr President.
We have a number of big programmes underway in Moscow and it would not be right to abandon them midway. I therefore think I should run in the election.
Vladimir Putin: I wish you success.
Sergei Sobyanin: Thank you, Mr President.
