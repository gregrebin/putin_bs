Before the conversation with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, welcome. I am glad to see you.
I would like to say once again that our prime ministers have been working hard and energetically for the past few days. I will be seeing them soon. If I may, I will bring your greetings to them.
President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
: Do please, if it is appropriate.
Vladimir Putin: But of course, why not?
Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, considering that we are discussing issues in their competence.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course. We will discuss all these issues now.
There is a great deal to talk about in the areas of security and economic interaction. It is encouraging, but it is developing unexpectedly well or at least at a fast pace, knock on wood. And the quality of our interaction and the structure of our economic relations are changing as we want. First of all, the current focus is not only on the traditional spheres of cooperation but also on the high-tech sectors. This is good news. I will not provide the figures for our growing trade now.
As for security, we will talk about it behind closed doors, one on one. Overall, the situation is stable, and I would even say good. We are collaborating confidently in this area.
We are proceeding on schedule with regard to the most sensitive issues, which we have coordinated. As you know, the preparation of the relevant facilities will be finished on July 7–8, after which we will immediately start the process of deploying the corresponding types of weapons in your territory. So, everything is going to plan consistently.
We always have plenty to discuss, and that is what we will do today.
Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you, President Putin.
You put it right – according to plan. We agreed back in Moscow to catch up at that time. Our prime ministers will be working, and if any issues arise, we will respond. After all, Belarusian-Russian relations are at the core of the EAEU and the CIS space. You are about to meet with the prime ministers.
I think we are conducting a comprehensive, useful event. Yes, there are economic issues but not problems, and they are being resolved. And, though you said I always criticised the governments, here they are doing a good job.
We have much to do, you put it right. The main point is that we know what to do and where to go.
Vladimir Putin: And we will make it. Thank goodness, we are getting there.
Alexander Lukashenko: I am even afraid to say it – knock on wood – as you did.
We thought it would be worse. But so far it is slightly better than we thought and thank goodness. We will gradually develop our relations. I said on record at the meeting of the EAEU Security Council secretaries that Russia and we would think of an action plan in this situation. Should we hope for the lifting of sanctions? We should not even talk about this. We must rely on our own strength, and on ourselves.
If we draft our action plan, our partners are bound to join it. I am sure Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in the EAEU framework will join us, and we will create attractive conditions here.
Vladimir Putin: Yes.
Alexander Lukashenko: I am confident our union in the EAEU framework will only become stronger.
Specialists should work with the governments. I think we can do it.
Vladimir Putin: I will now talk to my colleagues, say a few words myself, and listen to them. I suggest in the evening – I will tell you about this – we should exchange opinions on what our colleagues have done during the several days of their work in Sochi.
Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you.
