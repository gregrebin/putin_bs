Meeting of Federal Security Service Board
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
These annual FSB Board meetings give us a chance to meet and not only thoroughly analyse and review the results of the agency’s work over the period, but also to discuss at length all important national security issues in general and outline the priorities for the immediate future and the longer-term.
The FSB plays a key part in protecting our constitutional order and our country’s sovereignty, and in protecting our people from threats at home and abroad.
Let me say from the start that last year’s results were positive and show good development. This concerns your work to counter terrorism and extremism, a series of successful counterintelligence operations, your efforts to combat economic crime, and other areas.
You ensured a high standard of security for major public events, including the State Duma election and regional and local elections.
I would like to thank both the executives and staff for their conscientious attitude towards their work and their timely and efficient performance of their duties.
At the same time, demands on the quality and results of your work grow constantly. The global situation has not become any more stable or better over the past year. On the contrary, many existing threats and challenges have only become more acute.
Military-political and economic rivalry between global and regional policy makers and between individual countries has increased. We see bloody conflicts continue in a number of countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. International terrorist groups, essentially terrorist armies, receiving tacit and sometimes even open support from some countries, take active part in these conflicts.
At the NATO summit last July in Warsaw, Russia was declared the main threat to the alliance for the first time since 1989, and NATO officially proclaimed containing Russia its new mission. It is with this aim that NATO continues its expansion. This expansion was already underway earlier, but now they believe they have more serious reasons for doing so. They have stepped up the deployment of strategic and conventional arms beyond the national borders of the principal NATO member states.
They are provoking us constantly and are trying to draw us into confrontation. We see continued attempts to interfere in our internal affairs in a bid to destabilise the social and political situation in Russia itself.
We also see the recent serious flare-up in southeast Ukraine. This escalation pursues the clear aim of preventing the Minsk Agreements from going ahead. The current Ukrainian authorities are obviously not seeking a peaceful solution to this very complex problem and have decided to opt for the use of force instead. What is more, they speak openly about organising sabotage and terrorism, particularly in Russia. Obviously, this is a matter of great concern.
The events and circumstances I have mentioned require our security and intelligence services, especially the Federal Security Service, to concentrate their utmost attention and effort on the paramount task of fighting terrorism.
We have already seen that our intelligence services dealt some serious blows to terrorists and their accomplices. Last year’s results confirm this: the number of terrorism related crimes has decreased.
Preventive work has also brought results. The FSB and other security agencies, with the National Antiterrorist Committee acting as coordinator, prevented 45 terrorism related crimes, including 16 planned terrorist attacks. You deserve special gratitude for this.
You need to continue your active efforts to identify and block terrorist groups’ activity, eliminate their financial base, prevent the activities of their emissaries from abroad and their dangerous activity on the internet, and take into account in this work Russian and international experience in this area.
The murder of our ambassador to Turkey was a terrible crime that particularly highlighted the need to protect our citizens and missions abroad. I ask you to work together with the Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Intelligence Service to take additional measures to ensure their safety.
You must also work to take our counterterrorism cooperation with partners abroad to a new level, despite the difficulties that we see in various areas of international life. It is a priority, of course, to intensify work with our partners in organisations such as the UN, the CSTO, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
It is in our common interests to restore dialogue with the US intelligence services and with other NATO member countries. It is not our fault that these ties were broken off and are not developing. It is very clear that all responsible countries and international groups should work together on counterterrorism, because even simply exchanging information on terrorists’ financing channels and sources and on people involved in or suspected of links with terrorism can substantially improve the results of our common efforts.
Our priorities include firmly suppressing extremism. Security methods must go hand-in-hand with constant prevention work. It is essential to prevent extremism from drawing young people into its criminal networks, and to form an overall firm rejection of nationalism, xenophobia, and aggressive radicalism. In this context, of great importance is open dialogue with civil society institutions and representatives of Russia’s traditional religions.
Counterintelligence services also face greater demands today. Operational data show that foreign intelligence services’ activity in Russia has not decreased. Last year, our counterintelligence services put a stop to the work of 53 foreign intelligence officers and 386 agents.
It is important to neutralise foreign intelligence services’ efforts to gain access to confidential information, particularly information concerning our military-technical capabilities.
This makes it a priority to improve our system for protecting classified information comprising state secrets, particularly with agencies going over to an electronic document circulation system.
I would like to note that the number of cyberattacks on official information resources tripled in 2016 compared to 2015. In this context, each agency must develop its segment of the state system for detecting and preventing cyberattacks on information resources and eliminating their consequences.
The public expects greater results in such key areas as economic security and the fight against corruption. I ask you to be particularly thorough in monitoring the funds allocated for state defence procurement (a subject I have spoken about before), major infrastructure projects, preparation of big international events, and implementing federal targeted and socially important programmes. Regrettably, we still see many cases of state funds being embezzled or misappropriated.
Reliable protection of our state borders plays a big part in ensuring our country’s comprehensive security. The priority here is to close off channels through which members of international terrorist and extremist groups enter Russia, and put a firm stop to all forms of smuggling, from weapons to drugs and various bio-resources.
Of course, we must continue the work to develop border infrastructure where it is not yet sufficiently developed, particularly in the Far East and in the Arctic.
Colleagues, let me stress that we will continue to bolster the FSB’s central and regional branches and ensure you have the most advanced arms and equipment. We will also continue to give attention to social provisions for FSB personnel and their family members.
I wish you success in protecting our national interests and the security of our country and our people. I am confident that you will continue working towards your targets with dignity.
Thank you for your attention.

Beginning of talks with President of Uruguay Tabare Vazquez
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, colleagues,
Let me welcome you to Russia’s capital.
The previous visit by the President of Uruguay to Russia took place a very long time ago, in 1988, but our two countries maintain strong and good relations in practically all areas.
This year, we are marking the 160th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. We are pleased that you have decided to include Moscow in your current European tour.
We certainly need to discuss the development of our trade and economic ties. We know that our bilateral trade is not high. Agricultural produce and foodstuffs account for slightly more than 90 percent of our trade, but there are certainly opportunities for expanding our cooperation.
It is a pleasure to note that your country is probably the only country in the southern hemisphere that can boast a town, San Javier, where more than 90 percent of the population is of Russian origin. I would like to thank you for supporting these people and supporting their traditions, including their desire to keep alive their native language and Russia’s cultural heritage.
We know, of course, of the active work underway on the international stage. Uruguay is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and we are in constant contact on matters on the current agenda.
Welcome!
President of Uruguay Tabare Vazquez(retranslated): Thank you very much.

Press statements following Russian-Uruguayan talks
February 16, 2017
Mr President, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Government and the people of Uruguay, I want to thank you and your Government for receiving us with such warmth and understanding. This is very important for us.
You very rightly noted that this year we are celebrating the 160th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. As the Russian Federation Ambassador to Uruguay Alexei Labetsky rightly noted in 2014, our relations have withstood the test of time.
Of course, much has happened in Russia and in Uruguay over this time. However, despite all the events in the world, our countries maintain solid trade ties and cooperation, and most importantly, solid friendship. This is possible because we share the same values and principles. We support freedom, democracy, social justice and solidarity. Here, we can also note our common obligation to fight terrorism, regardless of its origins. We want our peoples and all of humanity to live in peace, and we hope that through dialogue and mutual understanding, we will achieve mutual respect and take our cooperation to a new level.
Mr President, it would be a great honour for the Government and people of Uruguay if you were to visit our country. This would give us a chance to go together to San Javier, where 300 families from Russia settled at the start of the 20th century. We could go and see them together. It is important that these families brought to Uruguay their culture, traditions and way of life, and in this way enriched Uruguay’s culture. They have taught us much. For example, they were the first to start cultivating sunflowers in Uruguay.
We are happy to be here on this visit and I am sure that we will work intensively to bolster our relations.
