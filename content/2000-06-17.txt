“This year, the world marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of the 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, and the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.
“These multi-lateral agreements play an important role in international security. Our country unfailingly abides by their provisions and principles. On May 22, 2000, a draft federal bill on lifting reservations to the Geneva Protocol made by the USSR in 1928 was submitted to the State Duma for consideration.
“Russia expects other signatory states to honour these agreements.
“As a depositary state, Russia consistently advocates the creation of an effective mechanism for monitoring compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and takes an active part in talks to draft a protocol on enhancing and streamlining the Convention.”
