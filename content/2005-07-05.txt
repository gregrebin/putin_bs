Astana
President Vladimir Putin: I am very happy to be able to meet with you again and talk, especially with elections just around the corner.
Acting President of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiev: Yes, there are only four days to go.
Vladimir Putin: I very much hope that the election results will lead to complete normalisation of the situation in Kyrgyzstan, which is something we very much want. We want to see a situation that would make it possible to start tackling social and economic development tasks. As before, we are ready to maintain friendly, special relations with the Kyrgyz people. As you know, we are trying to help in every way we can in the humanitarian area. Our economic relations are developing quite well with trade between our countries increasing by 35 percent over the last year. We have some good results and we also have some things to work on in all different areas.
Kurmanbek Bakiev: Yes, that we do indeed.
Vladimir Putin: I think we will have another opportunity to have a brief exchange of views on all these different issues.
Kurmanbek Bakiev: Thank you very much, Vladimir Vladimirovich. Indeed, we have only four days to go before the elections. The preparations are going quite well. I think that the elections will take place in strict accordance with the electoral code and that everything will be all right.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support at what is not an easy time for us. Above all, I want to thank you for the understanding you have shown of the situation we have found ourselves in right from the first days.
Today I can say with confidence that the situation is returning to normal and everything will be fine.
Of course, I would like to see economic ties develop at a faster pace. Our trade turnover is growing. We would like the presence of Russian business in our country to produce even greater results and we are doing everything we can to ensure that this will be the case. At least, we are trying to reform our government so that it will produce less words and more action in order to make all these projects a reality. The conditions are already in place for this to happen. A number of major investors are showing interest in the Kombarat Hydroelectric Power Station, in Kombarat-2. The construction of an aluminium smelter is also generating a lot of interest. Then, in the south, we do not have a single cement plant. There is one in the north not far from Bishkek, but, as you can imagine, the transport distance involved is a problem. It would be good, therefore, to have a big cement plant in the south. The raw materials are already there, in Botkinskaya Oblast. In other words, there are a lot of areas where we could work together.
Of course, the most important thing is to ensure stability, then work will certainly go ahead. The conditions are already in place and people want it to happen.
Vladimir Putin: You mentioned a genuinely important area of cooperation – the energy sector. This includes the construction of major facilities and there is nothing to stop us from carrying out such projects.
Kurmanbek Bakiev: In 2001, when I was prime minister, we began building Kombarat-2 using our own resources and we had the project almost 40 percent complete. We will complete Kombarat-2, Kombarat-1… There is huge potential for exporting electricity to the neighbouring countries, to Iran…
Vladimir Putin: And to Russia. You already supply us with electricity.
Kurmanbek Bakiev: Yes, but we have the possibility of exporting even more.

Press Statement Following the Meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of State
July 5, 2005
20:20
Astana
President Vladimir Putin: Russia is entirely satisfied with the results of the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of State that has taken place today.
The decisions we have adopted aim at expanding our cooperation in all areas and in our common interests in accordance with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation [SCO] Charter.
Though it is still a young organisation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has already proven itself a lasting and viable body that is gaining authority as an important regional international organisation. I think we could say that this is the main political result of the work carried out within the organisation over the last year.
The Declaration we adopted following our meeting is of great international significance. It sets out our coordinated policy and views with regard to the situation in the world. These policies and views are based on a common vision of what we should respect and protect. The Declaration reflects our understanding of the diversity of civilisation and development models and makes a call not to impose models and standards through force or the threat to use force.
In my view, the guidelines the Declaration maps out for our organisation are correct and reflect the demands of today’s situation. Among these demands, the question of ensuring stability and security in Central Asia and throughout the region covered by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation remains a priority given the rapidly changing situation in this part of the world.
We have confirmed once again that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation works on a comprehensive basis, uniting the efforts of each of its member states. It was this approach that formed the foundation for the work on drafting the Conception for Cooperation among the SCO Member States in the Fight Against Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism, which we have now approved. Implementation of this concept will enable us to establish the conditions for more precise and targeted work by the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure.
At the same time, I want to emphasise that this reinforced cooperation between the SCO member states does not mean that the organisation is becoming more closed off. On the contrary, the decision to accept India, Pakistan and Iran as observers is convincing proof of the SCO’s openness. Russia welcomes these countries joining the work of our organisation as observers.
We rate positively the economic cooperation between the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s members, both overall and in separate areas. Our aim is for the Council of Heads of Government to become a real headquarters for economic and humanitarian cooperation.
We are pleased to see that non-governmental, business and financial circles have also begun to pay more attention to economic and humanitarian cooperation. The Business Council and the Development Fund should become a good additional resource for our economic cooperation and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Forum that is in the process of formation should be of valuable help in providing scientific and analytical support for our activities.
The results of our meeting show that our organisation has great potential and opportunities that will, without any doubt, bring real and visible benefits for our countries and our peoples in the very near future.
Thank you very much.
