At the CSTO Collective Security Council meeting in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
We have just held our meeting in narrow format. We decided that during this expanded format meeting I would brief you on the CSTO’s work priorities during Russia’s chairmanship of the organisation, which has been handed to Russia by our Kyrgyzstani friends. Mr Bordyuzha [Secretary General of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO)] will then brief us on the final documents that we will sign.
Since 2010, it has been the practice for the country that is taking over the organisation’s chairmanship to set out its vision of the CSTO’s main priorities.
Let me mention the following main areas.
First, we think it important to reinforce the external borders in the CSTO’s region of responsibility. We need to improve our practical action mechanisms for minimising risks for each of the CSTO member countries. As we discussed in detail during the meeting in narrow format, the biggest risk is the problems linked to Afghanistan. 
In this area, as I said and we discussed just before, we will take a pre-emptive approach and work together to help Tajikistan to equip its border with Afghanistan. 
Our second priority is to continue developing military cooperation. The objectives for our work in this area were fixed in the documents we approved at the December session, concerning the main areas for developing our countries’ military cooperation through to 2020.
We must continue improving our collective forces’ command. In this respect, the recently established military committee, made up of our chiefs of general staff, has a big part to play. We need to pay particular attention to the rapid reaction collective force.

We hope that the Interaction-2013 joint exercises underway in Belarus will help to make the Collective Rapid Reaction Force more effective and improve its coordination.
Building up our peacekeeping forces’ capability is also of vital importance. We are sure that the Unbreakable Brotherhood-2013 exercises that will take place at the Chebarkul test ground in Chelyabinsk Region in October will mark an important stage in terms of preparing the CSTO contingent for taking part in peacekeeping operations. 
We will pay great attention to cooperation in countering modern threats and challenges. We have planned an active series of measures to combat drug trafficking. They include above all the regional anti-drug trafficking operation Channel and getting observer countries involved in its work too. The CSTO also has a big part to play in preventing propaganda of terrorism and religious extremism.
In foreign policy, we will work to improve coordination between the member countries on international and regional security issues. We have already made a good start in this area by approving in 2011 the collective instructions for CSTO member countries’ representatives in international organisations, which were updated last year. We think it an important principle that in setting our policy lines on this or that issue, the CSTO countries should be guided by their commitments as allies and take into account their partners’ views.
The CSTO must actively work together with other organisations involved in regional security issues, above all the CIS and the SCO. It is also in our common interest to expand constructive cooperation between the CSTO and the UN on peacekeeping and security matters. We have a legal basis for this cooperation in the Memorandum of Understanding signed in September 2012 between the CSTO secretariat and UN’s peacekeeping operations department.
Friends and colleagues, these are the priorities and main areas of work for Russia’s period chairing the CSTO. We hope that with your active support we will be successful in carrying them out.
Thank you very much for your attention.

Meeting of the CSTO Collective Security Council in narrow format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,
As representative of the host country, allow me to welcome you all to Sochi. I hope you have already had a chance to take a look at Russia’s Olympic preparations.
Some of you have been here before and some of you are here for the first time. We are meeting today to discuss issues concerning our organisation’s development and its activities in the parts of the world that are of interest to us.
It is my pleasure now to give the floor to the current chairman of the CSTO, the President of Kyrgyzstan. Mr Atambayev, you have the floor. 
<…>
Vladimir Putin: I also want to thank your colleagues, and you, Mr Atambayev, for your work as chairman of the CSTO Collective Security Council. You personally and all of our Kyrgyzstani friends have made a lot of effort to ensure that our work has progressed steadily and has not tailed off, but on the contrary, has continued to receive the attention of our governments and public.

This is the case because the CSTO plays a big part in maintaining regional security and stability. It is for the sake of these goals that we are continuing to improve operational and combat preparation of the military and special units that make up our collective security system.
We are holding a very intensive programme of joint exercises in this area. In September-October this year, we will hold three big exercises: Grom-2013 in Kyrgyzstan on September 20, Interaction-2013 in Belarus on September 19–25, and Unbreakable Brotherhood-2013 in Russia on October 7–11.
By raising our countries’ defence capabilities and our collective forces’ combat readiness and effectiveness, we can create a reliable barrier to terrorist and extremist threats. This is especially important with the foreign military contingent in Afghanistan preparing to withdraw in 2014. No matter what turn developments take in Afghanistan, we must not let ourselves be caught unprepared. I hope that today we will discuss in this context reinforcing and protecting the Tajikistani-Afghan border. 
The CSTO cannot ignore as serious an issue as the Syrian conflict. The armed groups operating in Syria did not come out of nowhere and will not disappear into nowhere. The issue of terrorism ‘spilling over’ from one country into another is very real and can affect the interests of any of our countries.
As far as this ‘spill over’ effect goes, we have just witnessed the terrible tragedy that is unfolding in Kenya. The gunmen seem to have come from another country by all accounts, and are carrying out terrible, bloody crimes there. On behalf of all of us, let me express our solidarity with Kenya, its people and government, and express our condolences to the victims’ families and to everyone affected by this bloody massacre. I hope the criminals will be punished.
It is in our common interests to settle crises through diplomatic means that open the way for political settlement and stabilisation of the situation in a country, including in Syria, which I mentioned just now. We will need to work on finding common approaches to this problem, which will be reflected in a statement of the CSTO member countries on Syria.
We have a broad-ranging agenda today. During the meetings in narrow and expanded format we will adopt or approve more than a dozen documents on various aspects of the CSTO’s activities. I am sure that this work together will be very productive and useful.
I just mentioned Syria and the terrible, bloody events in Kenya, but we somehow overlook other no less terrible events. Just yesterday, I think, there was a terrible terrorist attack in Iraq. Dozens, even hundreds of people, are dying there every day, and the situation in other parts of the world raises great concern as well.
In short, we have plenty to talk about today, and a lot of thinking to do on how to prevent and counter all of these threats that are unfolding in the world and that concern us directly too.
Let’s begin our work.

Press statement following the CSTO Collective Security Council summit

Statement for the press following the CSTO Collective Security Council summit.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
We have just ended this latest summit of the CSTO Collective Security Council, at which we discussed the progress made in implementing the decisions taken at the December session in Moscow and the informal summit in Bishkek in May this year.
We have adopted a communiqué following our meeting. It sets out our assessment of the work the organisation has done in foreign policy, military cooperation, and responding to modern threats and challenges.
We are happy with the way the CSTO is developing its military component. The work on improving the collective security forces’ combat readiness is proceeding very intensively.
In September-October this year, we will hold three big exercises: Grom-2013 in Kyrgyzstan on September 20, Interaction-2013 in Belarus on September 19–25, and Unbreakable Brotherhood-2013 in Russia on October 7–11.
The regular CSTO operations to combat drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and crimes in the information area are effective instruments in fighting modern challenges.
We place great importance on the Activity plan we approved today for carrying out The CSTO’s main military cooperation priorities through to 2020.
Today’s meeting made decisions on organisational, administrative and financial aspects of the CSTO’s work and approved its budget for 2014.
We discussed the situation in Afghanistan in light of the international coalition’s troop withdrawal planned for 2014. Unfortunately, there is reason to expect a considerable rise in Afghan drug trafficking activity and in terrorist groups’ activeness. 
Extremists are already attempting to spread their activity into neighbouring countries, including the Central Asian countries that are CSTO members. We will take into account all possible development scenarios, take preventive measures, and provide additional collective assistance to Tajikistan to reinforce its national border with Afghanistan. We agreed to draft a targeted interstate programme for equipping this section of the border.

We gave much attention to the Syrian crisis too. The CSTO member countries are unanimous in saying that we need to settle the situation in Syria exclusively through peaceful political means. Any military operation would be a gross violation of the norms of international law, an act of aggression, to use the language of the UN Charter.
Such a development of events would inevitably further destabilise the situation in Syria itself and in the Middle East in general and would have a negative effect on the region under our organisation’s zone of responsibility. 
Russia is grateful to its CSTO partners for their support of our efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the crisis and for supporting the Russian-US proposals regarding Syria’s chemical weapons. It is very important to use every possibility we have to try to stop the violence and get dialogue going between the authorities and the opposition. This consolidated position is reflected in the CSTO member countries’ Statement on Syria, which was approved today.
This session marked the CSTO’s chairmanship passing from Kyrgyzstan to Russia, which will chair the organisation until the Collective Security Council’s next summit in 2014. We presented to our partners the priorities for our chairmanship, which aim to make the organisation’s work more effective. 
The planned measures include strengthening security on the external borders in the organisation’s zone of responsibility, and improving the collective forces’ operational and combat readiness.
We also propose concentrating on training the CSTO peacekeeping contingents and also on combating drug trafficking, and preventing propaganda of terrorism and religious extremism. We think it important too, to develop further foreign policy coordination between the CSTO member countries.
I am sure that the exchange of views we had today and the agreements we reached will make a big contribution to guaranteeing security and stability in the CSTO’s zone of responsibility.
I want to thank once more everyone who took part in today’s meeting for their constructive and productive work. We had a very intensive, interesting and frank exchange of views.
Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, please allow me to warmly welcome you! Our colleagues say hello as well.
We have just completed an event within the framework of the CSTO – the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, with representatives from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Belarus. They know that you and I have a meeting today and asked that I pass on their warmest wishes.
I am pleased to note that overall, relations between our governments as well as our parliaments are developing very intensively, through both houses of Russian parliament.
I am not going to cover the entire range of our relations now; we will have time to discuss it in a little bit. But the parliaments of our nations certainly create a very good, positive atmosphere and are supporting efforts in all areas of activity, promptly making necessary, measured decisions.
I am very happy to see you, Mr Chairman! Welcome!
CHAIRMAN OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE’S CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ZHANG DEJIANG (translated from Russian): Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with you today. Before I left [China], President Xi Jinping specifically asked me to convey his very best wishes to you.
I am very pleased to be able to point out that our countries’ leaders do not only maintain a close working relationship. You are also very good friends. President Xi Jinping was very pleased with the successful outcome of the G20 summit that took place under your excellent leadership. He also asked me to convey his gratitude for your warm welcome. First and foremost I would once again like to pass on President Xi Jinping’s greetings to you.
In March this year, after President Xi Jinping was elected President of China, he chose Russia for his first foreign visit. During that visit he held a very important meeting with you, Mr President, and you agreed to further strengthen your comprehensive strategic partnership and cooperation. This opened a new chapter in the history our countries’ relations and cooperation.
In less than six months our countries’ leaders have already met three times; this will enable us to further develop our comprehensive strategic partnership and cooperation. I think that this is a rare thing in the history of international relations. The Chinese party highly values and attaches great importance to the development of a comprehensive strategic partnership and cooperation.
This is my sixth visit to Russia in the past decade. Unfortunately, I have not yet had the opportunity to meet with you, so I am especially pleased to do so today.
Mr President, I know that you benefit from a very good reputation not only in Russia, but also on the international stage. I am very pleased to meet with you today, and to exchange opinions face to face.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
Thank you for your kind words and the greetings from my good friend and partner, President of China Xi Jinping. I must say that we really do have very close business and personal contacts. This helps us in our work.
During the G20 you mentioned, China's voice came through very convincingly and authoritatively. I would ask you to convey my gratitude to President Xi Jinping for his active participation in the G20’s work, and my warmest, very best wishes.
