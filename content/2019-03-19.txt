Meeting with winners of the Leaders of Russia competition.
The main goal of the competition is to identify, encourage further development and support promising leaders from all over the country, those who have a high level of motivation and management potential.
The finalists have the opportunity to choose a mentor from among top regional officials, CEOs of large companies and public organisations, high-ranking representatives from the Presidential Executive Office, State Duma deputies and Federation Council members.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends. Let me welcome all of you.
As I see it, you are the winners of a fairly prestigious and increasingly interesting competition called the Leaders of Russia. I understand that the winners of the previous com-petition are also here. You will also tell us about your work after the competition.
I will repeat myself and will do it on purpose – in addition to this competition, we hold other contests and events related to the search for talented, young and promising people motivated by interesting work.
I am very pleased to note that this year we had a record number of applicants for this competition – 227,000 and 300 finalists. All finalists will receive a million rubles, while the 104 winners, also quite a few, will get mentors in addition to the financial prize.
Mentors are very well-versed people with a wealth of experience who have proven themselves through their work and, probably I can put it this way, through their lives. So you will have an interesting time. I hope this will not only be interesting but also practical for various activities.
These include social sector, business, and civil and municipal service. Previous events of this kind show that this is also worth-while for different management levels and various spheres of activity, and for those who take part in these events, the Leaders of Russia competition in our case.
Let’s listen to last year’s winners.
