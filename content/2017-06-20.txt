Russian-Kyrgyzstani talks in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, friends,
I am glad to welcome you at this expanded format meeting.
We have discussed bilateral issues, our ongoing projects and plans for the future in great detail. I suggest that we now give the floor to our colleagues – ministers and heads of agencies – who are responsible for the implementation of our strategic documents.
We have with us today the ministers and heads of companies that are working in Kyrgyzstan. I propose we start with them after we listen to what President of Kyrgyzstan has to say.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Thank you, Mr President,
To begin, I would like to thank you for your warm and heartfelt welcome and for your understanding of our problems. We are also grateful for the considerable support we have received from Russia during my presidency and also in 2011, when I was prime minister.
I am glad that our relations have moved from mistrust and mutual complaints to mutual understanding. We have reached a new level of relations based on strategic partnership. Also, I would like to say that our relations, especially economic cooperation, have grown stronger since Kyrgyzstan acceded to the Eurasian Economic Union. Despite gloomy forecasts, our accession to the EAEU has given a powerful boost to Kyrgyzstan’s economic development.
We have just discussed the figures at the restricted meeting, mentioning 20 percent and 30 percent increases. Of course, ordinary Kyrgyzstani nationals who work here could not fail to feel the difference in terms of their working environment.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the success of the Kyrgyzstan-Russia Development Fund. I would also like to thank the intergovernmental commission, as well as Russian ministries and agencies for providing various kinds of assistance to Kyrgyzstan.
Of course, we should not forget the cultural and humanitarian dimension of our relations. It is highly symbolic that today we will be inaugurating at the Grand Kremlin Palace the Days of the Kyrgyzstani Culture in Russia. On July 20, we will welcome Russian researchers and experts at the forum Altai Civilization and Related Peoples of the Altai Language Family, since it is high time that we emphasise that Russia is the ancestral home not only for the Kyrgyz people, but also for a number of other Central Asian nations. I hope that Russia will be well represented at and actively contributes to the forum.
I would also like to say that our two countries share a long-standing, millenary history. I strongly believe that we also have a shared future ahead of us.
As I told you today during the flower-laying ceremony at the Eternal Flame and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, I thought that this Unknown Soldier could be my great uncle Kulmambet Atambayev, who died somewhere in Russia, and we do not know where he was buried.
This is our shared history, and I am confident that we must preserve our brotherhood and friendship. We should definitely have a shared future.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.

Meeting with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin
Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Igor Sechin, Rosneft CEO, Chairman of the Management Board and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors.
June 20, 2017
18:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sechin, there is no need to describe Rosneft, since it has truly become one of the world’s oil and gas industry leaders. A lot has been done lately to consolidate the company. A portion of the company's shares went private, you now have strategic investors who have assumed certain commitments to develop the company and organise the sale of oil and petroleum products. In a word, the company is expanding.
I am aware that a general shareholders’ meeting will be held in a few days, so I would like to ask you to discuss a number of issues related to high technology, digital technology, the latest production techniques and, most importantly, changes on the international market.
You are among the participants in the process of coordinating the positions between our largest companies, and the Government, and, in turn, this is how we formulate our position with regard to our partners on the international oil market.
As a matter of fact, Rosneft participates in developing these decisions. You are aware of what is happening on the international market, so a new corporate strategy should be developed based on your knowledge. Of course, I would like to ask you to get back to the fiscal issues, namely, to paying 50 percent of the dividends based on net revenue.
These and other issues will need to be discussed with your colleagues during the upcoming meeting.
Rosneft CEO, Chairman of the Management Board and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors Igor Sechin
: Mr President,
We have carefully studied the instructions you issued at the St Petersburg [International Economic] Forum. Of course, we will use the upcoming general shareholders’ meeting and the board of directors meeting, which will follow the general meeting, to raise all the issues related to our response to the volatility on the international markets, strengthening the company's position in light of improving its efficiency and reducing costs, using advanced technology, such as digital material management technologies, supply chain management, and overhauling accounting systems across all areas of business pursued by our company.
We signed a relevant technology transfer agreement with General Electric several days ago and hope it will have a major impact. We will have to make some adjustments in corporate strategy.
We will use everything that is aimed at boosting efficiency and adopting cutting-edge technology in oil production and processing to approach the premium customer markets such as petrochemistry.
We will draft instructions and a new corporate strategy to deal with the challenges we are facing.
Vladimir Putin: Please tell us about the new deposit.
Igor Sechin: Mr President, we would like to thank you. You gave us the command to start working at the Khatanga licensed site. Here are the first results of this work. (Core sample is shown.) Please be careful – the core is oil-saturated. It is filled with oil and even has oil staining. This core is unique for our deposits. We made a tentative analysis and its high hydrocarbon content and productive bed thickness allow us to report to you, Mr President, that we are about to discover a very rich deposit.
We brought this core from a depth of 2,300 metres. Our task is to continue research to a depth of 5,000 metres in order to explore Lower Permian beds. Today our geologists are saying these will be unique deposits. According to preliminary technical studies in the Laptev Sea area, they may contain up to 9.5 billion tonnes of geological resources. This requires a serious effort. We hope you will follow up on our work and we will report to you on new results as they come along.
Vladimir Putin: All right.
