Russian-Kyrgyzstani talks in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, friends,
I am glad to welcome you at this expanded format meeting.
We have discussed bilateral issues, our ongoing projects and plans for the future in great detail. I suggest that we now give the floor to our colleagues – ministers and heads of agencies – who are responsible for the implementation of our strategic documents.
We have with us today the ministers and heads of companies that are working in Kyrgyzstan. I propose we start with them after we listen to what President of Kyrgyzstan has to say.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Thank you, Mr President,
To begin, I would like to thank you for your warm and heartfelt welcome and for your understanding of our problems. We are also grateful for the considerable support we have received from Russia during my presidency and also in 2011, when I was prime minister.
I am glad that our relations have moved from mistrust and mutual complaints to mutual understanding. We have reached a new level of relations based on strategic partnership. Also, I would like to say that our relations, especially economic cooperation, have grown stronger since Kyrgyzstan acceded to the Eurasian Economic Union. Despite gloomy forecasts, our accession to the EAEU has given a powerful boost to Kyrgyzstan’s economic development.
We have just discussed the figures at the restricted meeting, mentioning 20 percent and 30 percent increases. Of course, ordinary Kyrgyzstani nationals who work here could not fail to feel the difference in terms of their working environment.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the success of the Kyrgyzstan-Russia Development Fund. I would also like to thank the intergovernmental commission, as well as Russian ministries and agencies for providing various kinds of assistance to Kyrgyzstan.
Of course, we should not forget the cultural and humanitarian dimension of our relations. It is highly symbolic that today we will be inaugurating at the Grand Kremlin Palace the Days of the Kyrgyzstani Culture in Russia. On July 20, we will welcome Russian researchers and experts at the forum Altai Civilization and Related Peoples of the Altai Language Family, since it is high time that we emphasise that Russia is the ancestral home not only for the Kyrgyz people, but also for a number of other Central Asian nations. I hope that Russia will be well represented at and actively contributes to the forum.
I would also like to say that our two countries share a long-standing, millenary history. I strongly believe that we also have a shared future ahead of us.
As I told you today during the flower-laying ceremony at the Eternal Flame and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, I thought that this Unknown Soldier could be my great uncle Kulmambet Atambayev, who died somewhere in Russia, and we do not know where he was buried.
This is our shared history, and I am confident that we must preserve our brotherhood and friendship. We should definitely have a shared future.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.

Meeting with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin
Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Igor Sechin, Rosneft CEO, Chairman of the Management Board and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors.
June 20, 2017
18:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sechin, there is no need to describe Rosneft, since it has truly become one of the world’s oil and gas industry leaders. A lot has been done lately to consolidate the company. A portion of the company's shares went private, you now have strategic investors who have assumed certain commitments to develop the company and organise the sale of oil and petroleum products. In a word, the company is expanding.
I am aware that a general shareholders’ meeting will be held in a few days, so I would like to ask you to discuss a number of issues related to high technology, digital technology, the latest production techniques and, most importantly, changes on the international market.
You are among the participants in the process of coordinating the positions between our largest companies, and the Government, and, in turn, this is how we formulate our position with regard to our partners on the international oil market.
As a matter of fact, Rosneft participates in developing these decisions. You are aware of what is happening on the international market, so a new corporate strategy should be developed based on your knowledge. Of course, I would like to ask you to get back to the fiscal issues, namely, to paying 50 percent of the dividends based on net revenue.
These and other issues will need to be discussed with your colleagues during the upcoming meeting.
Rosneft CEO, Chairman of the Management Board and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors Igor Sechin
: Mr President,
We have carefully studied the instructions you issued at the St Petersburg [International Economic] Forum. Of course, we will use the upcoming general shareholders’ meeting and the board of directors meeting, which will follow the general meeting, to raise all the issues related to our response to the volatility on the international markets, strengthening the company's position in light of improving its efficiency and reducing costs, using advanced technology, such as digital material management technologies, supply chain management, and overhauling accounting systems across all areas of business pursued by our company.
We signed a relevant technology transfer agreement with General Electric several days ago and hope it will have a major impact. We will have to make some adjustments in corporate strategy.
We will use everything that is aimed at boosting efficiency and adopting cutting-edge technology in oil production and processing to approach the premium customer markets such as petrochemistry.
We will draft instructions and a new corporate strategy to deal with the challenges we are facing.
Vladimir Putin: Please tell us about the new deposit.
Igor Sechin: Mr President, we would like to thank you. You gave us the command to start working at the Khatanga licensed site. Here are the first results of this work. (Core sample is shown.) Please be careful – the core is oil-saturated. It is filled with oil and even has oil staining. This core is unique for our deposits. We made a tentative analysis and its high hydrocarbon content and productive bed thickness allow us to report to you, Mr President, that we are about to discover a very rich deposit.
We brought this core from a depth of 2,300 metres. Our task is to continue research to a depth of 5,000 metres in order to explore Lower Permian beds. Today our geologists are saying these will be unique deposits. According to preliminary technical studies in the Laptev Sea area, they may contain up to 9.5 billion tonnes of geological resources. This requires a serious effort. We hope you will follow up on our work and we will report to you on new results as they come along.
Vladimir Putin: All right.

Russian-Kyrgyzstani talks in restricted format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am happy to welcome you to Moscow.
President Atambayev and I met yesterday in an informal setting and discussed the entire range of bilateral issues, as well as regional and some international questions.
I am glad that we have an opportunity to meet in both restricted and expanded formats for substantive discussions on the development of our bilateral relations, our recent achievements – we have accomplished a great deal – and our plans for the future, including in the multilateral format of the Eurasian Economic Union, as well as on regional issues.
We are very close allies and reliable friends. We are aware of the transformations that took place in Russia in the past and in Kyrgyzstan in the past decade. We sincerely hope that this period of instability is over. Thanks to Mr Atambayev’s efforts, the situation in Kyrgyzstan has normalised and is irreversibly on the path of positive development. I congratulate you on this achievement.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: I hope that the achievements you made during your presidency, which will end in the next few months, will be carried on, and that we will continue to strengthen our bilateral relations and the situation in the region as a whole.
Almazbek Atambayev: Thank you, Mr President.
Yesterday we had a good opportunity to summarise the results, because, as you said, I have just a few months left, before Kyrgyzstan has a new President.
I would like to assure you that Kyrgyzstan would certainly never turn off this road found as a result of difficult pursuits. And, summing up the preliminary results of my work, I think one of the main achievements for the years of my presidency is that we have navigated our relations with Russia exactly into the channel of strategic cooperation, of friendship and brotherhood – the way they should be. We in Kyrgyzstan know that Russia is our greater homeland, as our roots are the Altai civilisation. And of course, we should always be together. We should always be together and continue the work of our fathers.
I would like to thank our Russian partners, the Russian Government and you personally – over the years of my work, one year as prime minister and six years as president, Kyrgyzstan has received immense help. I could cite the figures, but there was moral support as well – I felt it was always there, as you have said, truly fraternal support. This, of course, helped us overcome many difficulties and problems.
Once again I want to say that the situation in our country is completely different now. Most importantly, I am pleased about the prevailing attitude that this is what our relationship with Russia should be like, that there must be stability in the country. The country should grow; it should engage in political games less and take care of its economy more.
I am grateful for your invitation, for the respect, cordiality and warmth I see here every time.
Thank you
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Speeches at a state dinner hosted on behalf of President of Russia Vladimir Putin in honour of President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev and his spouse Raisa Atambayeva

At a state dinner hosted on behalf of President of Russia Vladimir Putin in honour of President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev and his spouse Raisa Atambayeva.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Ms Atambayeva, ladies and gentlemen,
My talks with the President of Kyrgyzstan just ended. As always, they were held in a businesslike, constructive and friendly atmosphere.
I would like to thank you once again, Mr President, and all our Kyrgyz colleagues for their openness to cooperation and sincere willingness to develop mutually beneficial multifaceted cooperation.
Russia and Kyrgyzstan are linked by centuries-old traditions, friendship and neighbourliness, strong ties of strategic partnership and alliance. They constitute a reliable foundation for moving ahead with confidence.
The year 2017 is of particular importance for Russian-Kyrgyz relations. Exactly 25 years ago, special ties were established: an agreement on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance was signed.
It is gratifying that we have approached this anniversary with significant results to show. Our two countries are closely cooperating in the political, economic, humanitarian and military-technical spheres, and actively working together within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union. Russia and Kyrgyzstan are both engaged in promoting security and stability in Central Asia, as well as fighting international terrorism, drug trafficking and organised crime.
As the Kyrgyz saying goes, what does not require much work is of little use. The Declaration on Strengthening the Alliance and Strategic Partnership signed today does not just sum up the results of many years of successful cooperation between our countries in various areas; it also sets new large and ambitious tasks for the future. I am confident that we will be able to achieve them by working together, harmoniously and purposefully, which we are fully capable of doing.
I propose a toast to the growing friendship between Russia and Kyrgyzstan, to the well-being and prosperity of our peoples, to the health of all those present, and to the health of the President of Kyrgyzstan.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev: Friends and colleagues,
I am deeply moved by the high praise of the work done during the years of my Presidency in Kyrgyzstan to create a really solid foundation for our allied, strategic relations to continue developing into the future without end.
I can probably admit today that during all these years I often argued with Mr Putin, and not only about work. However, sometimes we simply discussed historical matters. I recall that during his recent visit to Bishkek he asked: “Why is this building called ‘Enesai?’” I replied, “This is the Yenisei. Enesai means mother-river.” We discussed many issues and joked around, too.
I remember once we went so far… Baikal, Yenisei, Saratov, Siberia. Mr Putin said, “I see these are all Kyrgyz names, Kyrgyz words, but just do not ask to have them back.”
However, speaking seriously we agreed that Russia is the ancestral home, the centre, a country that engendered a huge civilisation – the Altai civilisation. I believe that one day the Russian Altai will become a sacral centre for the numerous peoples that live in Central Asia, China and beyond the Black Sea. One day it will become a sacral centre in Russia.
Many nations will understand that Russia is the centre of friendship, a country that brings only positive, bright things no matter how hard some forces in the world may try to demonise it. Of course, we see that all this nonsense is becoming laughable. I can say today with certainty that Mr Putin has never tried to do anything bad for any country. Quite the contrary. We know the reasons for many decisions. I know that those who make accusations against Russia or the President of Russia should look in the mirror. If they looked in the mirror, they would see who is really escalating tensions in the world.
I must admit, I love Russia very much. I am fond of Russian literature and I love the Russian people. When people in Kyrgyzstan want to describe a person as honest and straightforward, we say they have a Russian character. This shows the attitude of our entire nation to Russia and the Russian people.
Here is one example. When Mr Putin visited, I took him to the Memorial of the Survivors of the Siege of Leningrad. During the siege, many children were brought from Leningrad to Kyrgyzstan. One woman here in Issyk-Kul gave shelter to 150 children. Many kids lost their passports or rather birth certificates and they were registered as Kyrgyz. We have lots of red-headed kids, especially in Issyk-Kul.
Believe me; we truly have an ancient common history. When you take some ancient words or even modern words and try to get to their origins, you will see that everything is common, everything is native. God willing, we will preserve it and never yield to some enemies. We must preserve the feeling of fraternity, the feeling of kinship between our countries. I think that during these years, we have made a start on this and I believe it will only grow stronger with every year. I want to continue working to make sure our nations remember their common history and their common roots and to prevent anyone from trying to do what very nearly happened when they attempted to tear Kyrgyzstan away from its ancestral home and their fraternal nation. We do not wish to go through anything like that again.
I would like to raise a toast to the great Russian nation and, I dare say, to the great President of the great Russian nation. No matter how much dirt is slung at him – and this is the craze both in your country and in ours – if Vladimir Putin had not existed… I remember how Rossel began to establish the Urals Republic or the Siberian Republic. I think if a second disaster had taken place and Russia had fallen apart after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this would have been a terrible ordeal not only for the peoples of Russia but also of the entire world. It is essential to remember that this is the man who preserved Russia.
I wish happiness and prosperity to all the peoples of Russia. “What does not kill us only makes us stronger,” as they say. I wish you success, Mr Putin.
