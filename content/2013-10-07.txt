President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (translated from Russian): Mr President, delegation members, once again, welcome to Indonesia, to Bali.
I know that you had a long flight of 14 hours, and that the time difference with Moscow is 4 hours, but even so, we are holding this meeting with you here on the APEC summit’s sidelines. I hope this meeting will help to develop our relations and continue the work that began in Vladivostok last year.
Our relations are developing and growing stronger, and we can develop and strengthen them even further in the future.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: First of all, I want to thank you for the invitation, Mr President.
I am very pleased to see that our relations are developing and that our high-level political contacts and our economic ties are proceeding well.
Despite all of the problems in the global economy, our bilateral trade grew by 12.5 percent over the first half of this year. We have good prospects for developing cooperation in transport, aviation, the space sector, and the metals industry.
Of course I thank you too for the unexpected birthday congratulations today.
