President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Today, I would like to discuss with you measures to improve the work of regulatory and law-enforcement agencies on preventing violations of law in the sphere of natural resource management. This is a very important and urgent topic, particularly in practical terms.
We are continuously dealing with this in the Government, and the Presidential Executive Office is always in the know of things and makes its own contribution to this work.
There are also questions relating to ensuring law and order and this is certainly a topic that must be discussed at this current meeting with permanent members of the Security Council.
