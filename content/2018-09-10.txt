President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
We hold meetings with Mr Abe on a regular basis. You may have noticed, this is our second meeting this year, and the Prime Minister’s second visit to Russia. The Prime Minister of Japan is always accompanied by a representative delegation of official and business circles. This was the case at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in which about 150 leading Japanese entrepreneurs took part together with the Prime Minister. Now members of the Japanese Government, representatives of prefectures and several hundred major Japanese companies have arrived in Vladivostok with Mr Abe.
I would like to thank our Japanese partners for their high interest in developing mutually beneficial cooperation, and a striving to expand versatile contacts in the economy, politics and the humanitarian area.
I would like to note that Japan is an important and reliable partner for Russia. We continue to develop Russian-Japanese cooperation based on the principles of good neighbourliness, mutual respect and reciprocal consideration for each other’s interests.
Our countries are engaged in intensive political dialogue. On July 31 our foreign and defence ministers held talks in the “two plus two” format.
Today’s talks with the Prime Minister took place in a business-like and constructive atmosphere. We discussed in detail major bilateral issues, paying much attention to the prospects for expanding trade, economic and investment cooperation.
Following Russian-Japanese talks, Vladimir Putin and Shinzo Abe made press statements.
I would like to note that bilateral trade grew 14 percent last year and another 20 percent in the first six months of this year, with the export of Russian engineering products to Japan up almost 90 percent.
Japanese companies are actively investing in the most varied segments of Russian industry and agriculture. Total investment in the Russian economy has reached $2 billion.
About 100 mutually beneficial joint projects are being successfully implemented as part of the cooperation plan in eight areas proposed by Prime Minister Abe as well as the Russian list of priority investment projects.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation are cooperating closely. The Russia-Japan investment fund they have established helps the two countries’ businesses attract loans for prospective projects.
Today the Prime Minister and I attended the launch of a new Mazda Sollers plant near Vladivostok that will produce up to 50,000 car engines per year.
Energy is a main area of bilateral cooperation. This July, the second line of the LNG producing plant was launched as part of the Yamal LNG project with the participation of Japanese companies. The construction of the third line with a total capacity of 16.5 million tonnes is underway.
We are working on the possible involvement of our Japanese partners to the Sakhalin-2, Arctic LNG-2 and Baltic LNG projects as well as to the construction of an LNG handling terminal in the Kamchatka Territory.
Russian and Japanese businesses work together in the exploration of the Ichedinsky oil field in the Irkutsk Region.

Cooperation in the nuclear sphere is also expanding. Russian experts are developing detectors to search for and identify damaged fuel as part of the response to the aftermath of the Fukushima 1 nuclear disaster.
Our joint activities in the spheres of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are also developing dynamically. Japanese companies are participating in the construction of advanced transport infrastructure in Russia.
Russian Railways together with its Japanese colleagues have begun test runs for container shipping along the Trans-Siberian Railway. I hope that after they are successfully completed we will be able to significantly increase the volume of Russian cargo sent to Europe.
Cultural and humanitarian ties are also progressing. This May, Mr Abe and I launched the Year of Russia in Japan and the Year of Japan in Russia. This is a unique, large-scale project our countries are implementing for the first time.
The programme includes over 400 events dedicated to culture, art, science, youth exchanges and public organisations.
Our sports contacts continue to grow. In October and November in Japan, Russian athletes will be demonstrating Russian martial arts. The day after tomorrow, on September 12, Mr Prime Minister and I plan to welcome the winners of the Far East Tall Ships Regatta 2018.
We will also attend the international junior judo tournament dedicated to the memory of the famous Soviet athlete Vasily Oshchepkov, a pioneer of sports exchanges between our countries in martial arts.
We have of course tackled the peace treaty issue during the talks. As you know, this issue has remained unresolved for many decades and it would be naive to believe that it could be settled overnight. But we are ready to search for solutions that will suit both Russia and Japan and will be acceptable for the people of both countries.
In this context, we have noted some success in developing joint economic activities in the Southern Kurils and are satisfied with the progress in coordinating roadmaps for the implementation of projects in five approved areas: aquaculture, greenhouse farms, wind energy, package tours and waste management.
We also continue to discuss with our Japanese colleagues the free cross-border movement of residents of the neighbouring regions. We agreed to organise the third Japanese business mission to the Southern Kuril Islands by the end of this year, followed by a fourth round of talks on joint economic activities, where the results of this trip will be summed up, among other things.
To meet our Japanese partners halfway, we have simplified the procedure for the visiting of family graves in the Southern Kurils by former Japanese residents, something Mr Prime Minister repeatedly mentioned at our previous meetings.

Mr Abe and I exchanged views on important current international issues, including ensuring security and stability in the entire Asia-Pacific region.
Particular attention was paid to the developments on the Korean Peninsula. We intend to continue close contact to promote the inter-Korean dialogue and resolution of all political and diplomatic disagreements there.
In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Prime Minister and all of our Japanese colleagues for the business-like and substantive discussion. As I mentioned, we have a number of other events planned with Mr Abe, including the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum.
I am confident that this busy visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to Russia will give a fresh impetus to bilateral relations, which will continue to expand in the spirit of partnership and cooperation.
Thank you.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe (retranslated): This is the third consecutive year that I have visited Vladivostok where the azure sea and blue skies sparkle with dazzling beams. Participation in the Eastern Economic Forum and my meetings with President Putin in September are becoming a good tradition.
Regrettably, after 70 years there are still outstanding issues between Japan and Russia but President Putin and I would like to resolve them. We confirmed our common position in my homeland of Nagato. For two years we have been striving to resolve this common issue step by step.
We take different measures on the four northern islands in order to pursue joint public activities. President Putin and I have chosen five candidates for projects.
After exactly a year, at today’s meeting, we have endorsed a roadmap for implementing our projects: increasing sea products, tourism, electricity generation, and waste processing, five projects in all. President Putin and I have now decided how to resolve these issues and carry out these projects. A realistic way to implement them is taking shape.
We will hold a business mission to discuss implementation in early October. This will be a major step forward. We will continue resolving the issues related to the visits of the islands by the former residents, taking into account their needs.
In July, former residents paid a second visit to the burial sites of their relatives. I am grateful to our Russian colleagues for the work they did on this. We had to overcome some difficulties but we made it happen and continue working together on this.
The situation is changing for the better. What was impossible is now happening. The characteristics of Japanese-Russian cooperation are changing our approaches, and we can do these things without encroaching on the legal positions of either side.
As we gain more experience we are moving towards our common goal with the President – the peace treaty. We want to resolve this issue through our efforts. This is a goal for our generation. President Putin and I will do everything we can to achieve this.
Following Russian-Japanese talks, Vladimir Putin and Shinzo Abe made press statements.
The cooperation between military agencies and border services plays an important role in strengthening trust. The Chief of Staff of the Japan Self-Defence Forces is expected to visit Russia this October. We will cooperate closely in addressing such threats as terrorism and drugs.
We have had an open discussion on North Korea. The international community must strictly comply with the UN Security Council resolution to make it completely abandon nuclear weapons. We will continue to honestly cooperate with Russia.
I have explained Japan’s position to Vladimir Putin. Japan believes that if we solve the issues related to abductions of Japanese citizens and nuclear problems together we would be able to draw a line under our unfortunate past and normalise diplomatic relations; we would be able to provide economic aid to North Korea. I would like to note once again that in order to do this we must solve the problem of the North Korea’s abductions of Japanese citizens, and I received the President’s understanding and support.
I would like to think about other opportunities to develop our cooperation here, in this city to which President Putin attaches much importance, among Japanese and Russian businesspeople.
During my visit to Russia this May, President Putin and I launched the first-ever cross years of Japan and Russia. The programme includes Kabuki theatre, art exhibitions, Yabusame and other numerous events.
Many Japanese football fans who came to Russia to watch 2018 FIFA World Cup matches still hold in their hearts the amazement and unforgettable impressions of Russian hospitality and our national teams’ remarkable performances.
This year is a good year ˗ both Japanese and Russian people are showing more interest in each other than ever. New measures will be taken this October to ease visa requirements for Russian tourist groups. This is what the slogan of the Year of Japan in Russia calls for: There is a Japan You Don’t Know.

I am eager to step up these humanitarian exchanges. Two years ago in Vladivostok I suggested that we monitor the implementation of the eight-item cooperation plan in the city. Over 150 projects have been launched. Rehab centres have opened in the Far East and rapid communication services have been put in place. Thus, one project is being carried out after another.
President Putin and I visited the Mazda engine plant and saw the assembled engines that will be exported to different countries in Japanese cars. So, I can see wonderful images of future urban development in the city.
Today we exchanged diplomatic notes for the entry into force of the Japan-Russia convention on avoiding double taxation. I would like to welcome this agreement, which will be effective this October.
I would like to assure you on behalf of the Government that we are ready to create conditions for the further promotion of economic ties.
We coordinated issues on restoring the meetings of Japanese and Russian governors that have not been held in a long time. Our local government bodies that did not contact before have started cooperating and communicating. I would also like to welcome the increase of this new communication.
Japan and Russia do have a complicated issue, but it is possible to hold a difficult conversations with you because we enjoy mutual trust. It is quite possible to find a mutually acceptable solution with you. I believe in this.
We will meet on the sidelines of various international conferences. We will meet at the G20 forum in Osaka in June and will close our cultural cross years together in Tokyo. We have just agreed to do this. I will do everything I can for every meeting with you to be productive.
I wish every success to the Eastern Economic Forum. Good luck!
Thank you.

State Council Presidium meeting
In Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of the State Council Presidium on measures to meet the targets set out in the May 2018 Presidential Executive Order in order to ensure priority socioeconomic development of the Russian Far East.

Remarks at the State Council Presidium meeting
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Just like one year ago, we have a meeting here, in the capital of the Primorye Territory, to discuss socioeconomic development of Russia’s Far East. We will review the progress made on earlier decisions and identify new tasks that we can work on together.
I will not go into details on the results we have achieved since 2013 when we started paying special attention to the promotion of the development of Russia’s Far East.
You know that we have done quite a bit. I would like to thank all of our colleagues who were in charge of these efforts over the past years. Let me emphasise that our achievements provide a foundation for moving forward and doing even more.
We held a meeting with Government members in July to identify the main short- and mid-term initiatives. It is now time that we review the key matters with the heads of all the Far Eastern regions.
Colleagues, I expect you to give a clear and detailed account of the problems and state your position as regards the creation of the national projects envisaged by the May Executive Order. This work is not yet completed, therefore it is especially important to discuss today those specific issues that are top priority for the Far East.
In addition to this, I would like to hear from you about the scope of the initiatives to promote priority development in the Far East as part of these projects, whether there are plans to take special measures to reduce the development gap, the funding allocated to this effect, how long it will take to achieve these objectives, and whether there are any lingering problems and why they exist, so that we can understand what causes them.
We must do everything in order to create an enabling environment for people in the Far East, so that they can make use of their talents, achieve their life goals, feel that they matter, receive adequate pay, enjoy a people-friendly environment, are able to access quality services and do not consider long distances as an obstacle.
Colleagues,
Resolving demographic problems, stabilising and then increasing the population in the Far East is a top priority.
We all know that people are still leaving the region, even if there are now fewer of them willing to do so. Last year, the migration outflow exceeded the inflow by 17,000.
The fact that 70 percent of those who leave are working-age people is a matter of special concern. All this is taking place against the backdrop of economic growth in the macro region and high demand for labour in the Far East.
At the State Council Presidium meeting.
The conclusion is obvious: people are not satisfied with the current living conditions. The Far East still falls behind and has yet to resolve many problems, including poor availability of housing, quality services in healthcare, education, communications, lack of modern culture and sports facilities, poor transport accessibility. Cities and towns have taken a back seat in terms of urban development.
Taking into consideration the ongoing plans to build new industrial plants, by the middle of the next decade the demand in the region for skilled professionals is set to improve.
It is obvious that the time has come for us to address this matter, and we need an integrated solution. We need to promote vocational training, offer preferences to those willing to move to the Far East, and of course create a people-friendly environment for all people who live here.
Let us discuss what additional measures could be taken, and this includes supporting employers who create jobs in the Far East and invest in training workers.
In this regard, let me note that the life expectancy in the Far East is slightly above 70 years of age, which is below the national average. The high mortality rate among working-age people is a very alarming indicator.
Reducing the mortality rate is a major priority, and I ask the Healthcare Ministry and the Government in general to act with more resolve and effectiveness, especially when it comes to improving the healthcare infrastructure and providing medicines.
What else would I like to draw your attention to? Right now the birth rate in the Far East is slightly higher than the nationwide average and this is, undoubtedly, a plus point. But this is not enough. The Far Eastern regions need to reach a stable natural demographic growth level.
The Government has already been instructed to develop special measures to help raise the birth rate. We are talking about increasing the first child allowance and the second child allowance as well as reducing mortgage rates for families with children.
All these proposals need to be taken into account when developing the national projects with the implementation scheduled already next year.
Colleagues,
In the Far Eastern regions we have identified economic growth centres where additional social infrastructure will be created. These include almost all key cities in the region, major industrial and research platforms.
We are allocating over 50 billion rubles from the federal budget for the social development plans in these centres through to 2020. These funds must be used with the utmost care so as to enable the most cost effective new schools, hospitals, cultural and sports facilities.
This is a huge construction project where it is necessary to relieve the bureaucratic burden as much as possible, create incentives for companies that are able to solve national tasks of high responsibility.
At the State Council Presidium meeting.
Let me remind you that the next Winter Olympic Games will take place in 2022 in Beijing and the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo. Our Olympic teams must successfully prepare for these major competitions. The Government and the regional officials need to address the issues of construction and renovation of sports facilities in the macro region and present their proposals.
I would like to emphasise once again: not only individual regions, but the entire Russian Far East needs to be proactive in terms of growth rates in the economy, the social sphere, and demographic development.
At a meeting in July, it was proposed that up to 5.5 percent of the total investment expenditure under our state programmes be channelled into Far Eastern projects.
We must certainly begin implementing this decision, we need to do this, to reach this level, but it is important that industry-specific federal bodies support these projects and that proper design and estimate documentation is in place.
And, most importantly, the regions and municipalities should be in a position to afford the maintenance of the new facilities.
Another important goal, vital for the residents of the Far East, is to increase the region’s transport accessibility. Over the last few years, we have been working on a system of inexpensive subsidised flights to the Far East. Not all problems have been resolved, but many people have already noticed the changes. It is necessary to continue working on the systemic organisation of available air transportation and other passenger routes to the Far East.
The same systematic approach should be taken in regulating the most important electricity, heat, gas, and water rates. Here we need to introduce a long-term price regulation model so that businesses can make their investment plans – everyone understands this – and the regions and municipalities can plan their budgets based on the cost of using social and other facilities.
Colleagues,
Faster development of the Far East is a nationwide goal, I have repeatedly said this. Everyone should work intensively, actively, with full dedication, without delay, and without reviewing the substance of decisions already made.
I ask you to report to me today on how these instructions are being implemented, not only those issued following the State Council presidium from a year ago, but all instructions concerning the development of the Far East.
Let's move on to discussion.
<…>
I would like to thank everyone. I would like to say that we will have to complete a list of instructions and finalise it. And once again I would like to draw everyone’s attention to the significance of the ongoing work to stabilise the situation in the Far East, to promote development in the Far East, efforts that will create new industries and well-paid jobs. I will not repeat everything my colleagues have said here, but I would like to thank the regional leaders, those who worked on today's document. We will consider all the comments and move forward.
Now, much will depend on you – and when I say you, I mean my colleagues from the regions. Now that the election campaign is over, I also would like to thank the Russian voters on your behalf for their involvement, for showing their civic stance. In some regions, including here, in the Far East, there will be a second round, which is normal and common. I am confident that this stage will be completed soon.
On the whole, the election went smoothly, with good voter turnout, in an organised manner and with a minimum of violations. No serious violations have been recorded so far. There certainly have been some rough edges; we definitely need to deal with this, and we will do it. But as we always say in such cases to the newly elected regional leaders and people’s deputies – and I will say this with good reason today – this is a serious step in your life and career. This is certainly a resource of our citizens’ trust for the development of their regions, cities and the entire country.
I wish you all good luck. Thank you.

Beginning of meeting with Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
September 10, 2018
14:45
Vladivostok
President of Russia Vladimir: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you in Vladivostok.
We remember your previous visit to Russia and are working according to the plan that we put together during that visit.
Relations between our countries are steadily developing. For the first time in history, this also applies to cooperation between our defence departments.
We are developing cultural cooperation. We have launched an unprecedentedly large event – cross years of Russia in Japan and Japan in Russia.
Our trade is growing: it went up last year and increased by another 20 percent in the first half of this year. Indicatively, Russian exports of engineering products grew by 90 percent and textiles by 14 percent. These are good figures.
Today we visited an enterprise with Russian-Japanese investments – the Mazda plant. It produces not only cars but also assembles engines, all of which are exported.
We are very glad to see you. We are sure that today’s meeting and the stay of your representative delegation that includes over 200 entrepreneurs will further benefit our bilateral relations.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): Mr President, I am glad to meet you here in Vladivostok for the third year in a row.
Our relations are steadily developing in accordance with our agreements. Only three months have passed since our last meeting. Our agreements, such as the ones on bilateral foreign ministry and defence department consultations in the so-called two plus two format, are being carried out one after another. Charter flights allowing former residents of the islands to visit ancestral graves continue. So our relations are developing.
I am pleased to note that as a result of our joint participation with President Putin in the opening of the cross years of Russia and Japan at the Bolshoi Theatre in May we managed to get our cross years off to a good start.
Japanese culture is also popular. To my knowledge, the Kabuki Theatre will perform in Moscow and St Petersburg. This greatly improves mutual understanding between our people. We also have other events.
I am glad that the teams of our countries played with great success at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. I would like to congratulate you on the success of this event.
Today I would like to conduct an honest exchange of views on bilateral issues, including the economy as well as international tasks – how we will cooperate with Russia.
I would also like to talk about our historical task – the problem of signing a peace treaty.
