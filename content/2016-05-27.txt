At the opening ceremony of the exhibition of the Ascension icon by Andrei Rublev.
The Byzantine and Christian Museum in Athens, where the icon is exhibited, houses one of the most famous collections of Byzantine art. Its exposition counts more than 25,000 icons and divine service items, jewellery pieces, sculptures, mosaics, frescoes, ceramic items and manuscripts covering the period from the 3rd to the 20th century.
The first collection of the museum, which was officially opened in 1914, was put together by the councillor to Queen Olga of the Hellenes (before marriage Grand Duchess Olga Romanova), founder of the Christian Archaeological Society George Lambakis.
The Ascension icon, painted by Andrei Rublev in 1408, is part of the State Tretyakov Gallery’s collection.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honour for me to attend the opening of this unique exhibition of the Ascension icon, a masterpiece from the collection of Moscow’s State Tretyakov Gallery. This is a work by a great icon-painter, monk Andrei Rublev.
Andrei Rublev took his inspiration from the cultural and religious heritage of Byzantium, whose spiritual successor Greece is. Having mastered various elements and techniques of Byzantine artists, Rublev was able to add to and enrich them. Mr Prime Minister highlighted the Russian style of this icon.
For a long time, the name of Andrei Rublev was known only to specialists. It was only in the 20th century that his art gained broader recognition. Only five of his works, five icons, have survived. The Ascension is one of them. It exudes a sense of harmony and a balance of form that are inherent to the artist. The icon was painted in the early 15th century during the restoration of the Dormition Cathedral in Vladimir.
I would also like to highlight that the exhibition is held as part of the cross-cultural years of Russia and Greece, whose launches the President of Greece and I declared in Moscow in January. I am sure that many more memorable events will be held in the course of this extensive project.
I would like to thank the management of the State Tretyakov Gallery for organising this exhibition and to express gratitude to our Greek partners and friends, the staff of the Byzantine and Christian Museum in Athens. I know that exhibits form your museum will be demonstrated in Russian museums in Moscow and St Petersburg. Thank you very much for this. I am sure that this will arouse a huge interest not only among specialists but all lovers of pictorial art and spiritual paintings, in particular.
Thank you.

With Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos.
President of the Hellenic Republic Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, I am particularly pleased to welcome you to the Presidential Palace of our Republic. I welcome you, the President and the leader of Russia, a great and friendly power.
Your visit takes place amid an exceptionally crisis-ridden situation, in many respects, in our region and in all of Europe. This situation, in light of the overwhelming influence of your great nation, Russia, obliges me to note the following two extremely important consequences of your visit, without in any way diminishing your talks on multi-level bilateral cooperation, which you will have later with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
 First, your visit takes place during the reciprocal Year of Culture between Greece and Russia. Visiting Mount Athos, the cradle of Orthodox Christianity, is an important part of your tour. We will have an opportunity to see, in our tumultuous times, as I have already pointed out, how the tenets and values of Christianity in general and Orthodox Christianity in particular can and should inspire the peoples of the world and their leaders to seek the triumph of humanism, solidarity, justice and peace in any important decision they take on the future of their nations and, ultimately, all of humanity.

Second, since we are talking about the ultimate blessing of peace, your visit gives me a chance to underscore yet again, as I did during our meeting in Moscow, the importance of close and sincere cooperation between Russia, the United States, and the European Union to bring the war in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, to an end. This is the only outcome that can lead, on the one hand, to an effective resolution of the acute refugee problem with full respect for human values and, on the other hand, can completely eradicate ISIS jihadi terrorism, the epitome of a new and heinous barbarism, whose members commit crimes against humanity.
 Welcome, Mr President. I assure you that your presence here is the culmination of centuries of sincere and exceptionally productive friendship between our countries and peoples.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
First of all, I would like to thank the entire Greek leadership for the invitation.
Indeed, we are going through hard times due to economic and international security issues. I think it is very important to compare notes, as they say, to talk, to discuss all these issues and look for solutions. It is meaningful that we are able to do this in Greece, a country that is linked with Russia by deep and long-standing spiritual ties.
During your visit, we announced the start of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. We can look at the events planned in this context and, as you rightly said, look back to our common roots.
I am grateful to you, the Greek Orthodox Church, and the Ecumenical Patriarch for supporting my future visit to Mount Athos. This is very important for us: Russian monks have been there for about a thousand years. The exact dates are probably not as important as our shared moral and spiritual values.
Naturally, we are happy to have this opportunity to talk with you aboout developing economic relations. As you noted, we will discuss this in greater detail with your Prime Minister.
 There are certain problems but there are some impressive achievements as well: last March the number of Russian tourists in Greece grew by 523 percent. We can do a lot more, and not only in tourism but in other areas as well.
I think it is especially important to discuss all these opportunities today and map out specific steps to take advantage of them.
Thank you.
