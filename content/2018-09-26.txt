Kazbek Kokov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kokov, the subject of our meeting, our conversation is a republic that is not unfamiliar to you – your native Kabardino-Balkaria.
It so happens that your namesake, Yury Kokov
, asked to be transferred to Moscow for a number of reasons, including family.
In this context I would like to discuss with you some issues related to the republic. You worked there yourself in different capacities. You were a deputy minister and later on a deputy of the republic’s parliament. For many years you have worked in the Presidential Executive Office of the Russian Federation.
It is not for me to tell you how closely your family has been tied to your native republic. Your father headed the republic from 1992 to 2005 and left behind very good memories of him. He was an effective leader and a very reliable friend.
I would like to offer you to return to Kabardino-Balkaria, to begin with as the acting head of the republic
Kazbek Kokov
: Thank you very much. Thank you for your confidence. I am ready for the job.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
