Vladimir Putin: Hello dear friends,
First of all I would like to congratulate you on the 41st anniversary of the first manned spaceflight, and on your holiday, Cosmonauts Day. I know that all those involved in space exploration share this holiday with you. I also wish to congratulate you on behalf of the President of the United States with whom I have just spoken over the phone. We are following your work, we admire your courage and we wish you success.
The President of the United States and I agreed on many issues today, including further work in the Russia-NATO framework, disarmament, some economic issues and the resolution of regional crises. These were the topics of our conversation.
We do not underestimate the significance of the work being done by the Russian and American crew members on board the International Space Station. What you are doing is very important for our countries and for all of mankind. It is not only an important theme of cooperation between the two countries, but an achievement of practical results for the United States, the Russian Federation and the other countries taking part in the grandiose project of the International Space Station.
All the best to you, and goodbye.
