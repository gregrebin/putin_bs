Speech at the reception celebrating Heroes of the Fatherland Day
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear friends, veterans, comrades.
I congratulate you on Heroes of the Fatherland Day.
This holiday is a tribute of the state and society to those who have received the highest state awards: Heroes of the Soviet Union, Heroes of the Russian Federation, the Order of Glory and the Order of St George.
Russia has always been proud of such people, who are ready to show courage, valour and bravery and perform heroic deeds in the name of the Motherland and their family and friends.
Heroism and self-sacrifice for one’s comrades are qualities of our national character, as we often say. These are the people, heroic people, who claimed the territory of Russia, repelled unfathomable attacks and aggression, and liberated other peoples.
When soldiers go into fierce combat, a fierce battle, and sacrifice themselves, when rescuers save children, when cosmonauts and sailors discover new routes, their own heroism is the last thing on their minds. They just do their duty, guided by their conscience, the memory of their forebears, and the lessons and values instilled by their parents and mentors.
The invincibility of the Russian people lies in this continuity of generations and moral and spiritual strength. Throughout history, it has always been so.
Today we remember the legendary and unknown heroes of past battles who fought in the first and second world wars. Those who fought and won in Afghanistan, took on terrorists in Russia and fight now in Syria.
We are proud of your courage and valour, and sometimes even your genuine modesty. We are immeasurably grateful to you for doing so much for our country and for serving Russia today. We bow in memory of those who perished: perished in the trenches and in the skies, protecting their comrades, but never retreating. We remember those who are no longer with us.
I am confident that a day like today will continue to serve as a symbol of the continuity of the heroic traditions and deeds, and the victories of Russia.
Friends, unfortunately, today’s work schedule and meetings do not permit me to stay with you much longer in this wonderful, festive atmosphere. But I simply must offer a toast to the Heroes of the Fatherland and to the wellbeing of all of you and your families.
To the great Russian nation and the great multiethnic Russian people!
