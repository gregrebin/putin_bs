President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Dear friends – let me welcome you to Sochi. I am very happy to see the competitors in the parallel slalom world cup here today. I hope that you are not too tired from yesterday’s competition, or from today. The weather here today is typical for Sochi.
We really are very glad that you have come to see how one of Russia’s most famous and beautiful resorts looks – the place that will host the 2014 Winter Olympics. Preparation is underway all around us, and now we find ourselves at what will be the very epicentre of those future sporting events. There is still much work to be done, but we are certain everything will be finished in time for the Olympics, which are now not long away, and that it will be held at the highest possible level. I would like to wish you good luck in the competitions that are underway at the moment. I hope you will get at least a general feel for this, our city. I hope that victory awaits you.
Dear friends, let me once more take this opportunity to thank you, and to wish you Happy New Year and Merry Christmas, and let me wish you all the very best. We really are very pleased to have you here, in Sochi, and hope that you will come again.
Thank you.
