President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, Ms Minister [Jayaraman Jayalalithaa, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu],
ladies and gentlemen, dear Indian friends,
Today, in accordance with the agreements we reached in Tashkent, we are witnessing the start of full operation of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit 1 in India. This is a big event for our Indian partner, for the Russian company that carried out this project, and for all of us. The power plant was built using the most advanced world technology, Russian technology, and was built by Russian and Indian specialists working together.
Cooperation in nuclear energy is an important part of the privileged strategic partnership between our countries. Our work together in this sector has great importance for our countries’ development. This is not just about building a nuclear power plant and putting it into operation, but is a large-scale project to develop a new high-tech nuclear sector in India. This work involves transfer of skills and training of personnel and specialists in this area.
Russia is well known as a leader on the international market for nuclear technology and services. The nuclear power plants built by Russian specialists are reliable and meet the very highest safety standards. We are sharing with our Indian colleagues our experience and developments in this priority high-tech sector.
Unit one is starting work at its nominal capacity and a second unit will also come on line in the not so distant future, and this will substantially boost India’s energy supply and bolster its economic position. Peaceful nuclear energy development will be essential for a vast, powerful and rapidly growing country like India to resolve its social and economic tasks.
Together with our Indian friends we have big plans in this sector. Work began on the power plant’s third and fourth units in February this year. We plan to sign a general framework agreement and loan protocol for the construction of the third stage of the project by the end of this year. I would like to remind you that this project is being carried out using funds provided by the Russian Federation. Of the total project financing, 85 percent is in the form of a state loan provided by Russia.
I congratulate everyone on today’s event. I thank everyone who took part in implementing this project, and once again, I wish you success and all the very best. I am certain that our work together in this and other economic and high-tech cooperation areas will produce tangible and noticeable results and will contribute to our economies’ rapid and effective development.
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi
: His Excellency President Vladimir Putin, Honourable Jayalalithaa ji, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Sushma Swaraj, Minister of External Affairs, Minister Pon Radhakrishnan, my dear friends, welcome!
Today is indeed a special day. Today, Excellency Putin and I have the honour to dedicate Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit 1. I am particularly grateful to President Putin for his presence at this event. And I am delighted that Jayalalithaa ji, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, is also present with us on this occasion.
Friends,in dedicating Kudankulam 1, we mark another historic step in India-Russia relations. Its successful completion is not just another fine example of the strength of our special and privileged strategic partnership. It is also a celebration of our abiding friendship. And it is only a start of our collaboration in this field.
It is perhaps not commonly known that at 1,000 megawatt, Kudankulam 1 is the largest single unit of electrical power in India. In years ahead, we are determined to pursue an ambitious agenda of nuclear power generation. At Kudankulam alone, five more units of 1,000 megawatt each are planned. In our journey of cooperation, we plan to build a series of bigger nuclear power plants.
Friends, today’s event is also a joyful occasion for the team of Indian and Russian engineers, scientists and technicians. We salute their dedication and hard work and congratulate them for the fruits of their labour.
Friends,the story of human development has been of wide spread technological advancement and growing economic prosperity.
But, as we all know, it has not been without burden on our environment. I have a vision for India where achievements of our economic development are respectful to mother earth, and where the engines of our industrial growth are increasingly driven by clean energy. Kudankulam 1 is an important addition to India’s continuing efforts to scale up production of clean energy in India. It also signals our joint commitment to build pathways of partnership for green growth.
Excellency President Putin, the success of our joint efforts in nuclear power generation is a proud achievement of our cooperation. It demonstrates our common resolve to grown and build on new dimensions of our ties.
Above all, it showcases your personal commitment, consistent support and strong leadership in transforming the substance and character of our relationship. For this I am grateful to you, Mr President.
The people of India associate naturally and with great ease with the people of your great country. And personally, I have always deeply valued our friendship. It is, therefore, only fitting that today we join together to dedicate the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant unit one to the strength and vigour of our friendship and cooperation.
Long live Indo-Russian friendship!
I once again thank you, Excellency Putin, for joining me in this dedication and I look forward to meeting you at G20 in China. Also, my sincere thanks to Dr Jayalalithaa for being with us. Thank you. Thank you very much.
