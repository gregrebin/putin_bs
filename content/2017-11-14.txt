Opening remarks at a meeting on electric power industry development
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
Today we will discuss plans for Russia’s electric power industry development and will primarily focus on the objectives of heat generation. It should be noted that the sector’s capacity has improved quite a bit in recent years. Thus, over the last five years, or between 2012 and 2016, heat-generating capacity has increased by 6.7 percent. The industry handles two-thirds of the country’s installed energy capacity or 164 gigawatts. Thermal power stations provide almost 60 percent (57 percent, to be precise) of Russia’s electric power.
Along with the increasing capacity, there are also qualitative changes, which is, of course, good to see. Thanks to new facilities, thermal power plants now have a lower accident rate and provide a more reliable power supply to production facilities, social organisations and residential buildings. The use of state-of-the-art technology ensures compliance with higher environmental standards.
Such positive dynamics in the work of the Russian energy system, as well as the removal of barriers and the optimisation of administrative procedures, have made it possible to significantly simplify and shorten the timeline for connecting to technological networks.
It is a pleasure to note that our country took 10th place in the Getting Electricity category of the World Bank’s updated Doing Business international ranking, so it is among the world leaders. For comparison, back in 2012 we were in 183rd place out of 190 countries. Therefore, the upward movement is clearly significant, which is a positive aspect of your work.
Of course, it is necessary to continue developing an infrastructural basis for economic growth and strengthening the social sphere, including increasing the stability and efficiency of thermal power stations.
I would emphasise that the created reserve in the form of new capacities gives us today the opportunity to implement a large-scale long-term programme to modernise Russia's thermal power industry. Its priorities are the withdrawal from use and replacement of outdated, inefficient equipment; the introduction of resource-saving, environmentally friendly technologies; and the development of capacities based on modern facilities with higher reliability and efficiency.
It is necessary to link these plans with programmes to develop Russia’s territories and key industries and provide reserves for economic growth. And, importantly, investment in renewing generation should cut operating costs, and therefore, I want to emphasise this, the capital costs should not fall on the shoulders of consumers, businesses, citizens, or social and state institutions. In other words, it is necessary to strictly follow the current procedure for establishing energy tariffs.
On that note, I will conclude my opening remarks and pass the floor to Mr Novak
, Minister of Energy. Then I will ask Mr Artemyev
to speak, and we will have a discussion.

Press statements following Russia-South Ossetia talks
Vladimir Putting and Anatoly Bibilov made statements for the press following Russia-South Ossetia talks.

Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Bibilov, ladies and gentlemen, friends and colleagues,
We are happy to welcome President of the Republic of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov and his delegation. We have just had talks where we discussed various aspects of bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on current regional problems.
South Ossetia is an important partner and ally of Russia. The cooperation between our counties is based on the strong foundation of friendship and neighbourliness.
Russia supports South Ossetia in becoming a sovereign democratic state, as it supports its security. We also try to promote the socio-economic development of the country in every way we can. Our talks today were mostly dedicated to trade and investment issues as well as cooperation in the social sector.
South Ossetia is an important partner and ally of Russia. The cooperation between our counties is based on the strong foundation of friendship and neighbourliness.
Russia is South Ossetia’s main foreign trade partner. Bilateral trade has grown significantly this year. In January-September it grew by almost 50 percent compared with the same period last year, with exports to Russia growing by more than a quarter. Mr Bibilov and I have given instructions to the Intergovernmental Commission to take additional measures to stimulate bilateral exports and imports.
The implementation of the investment programme for 2015–2017 was also discussed in detail. Let me remind you that Russia allocated 7.6 billion rubles for its implementation. These funds were directed to dozens of vital projects for the republic, including the reconstruction and modernisation of transport and social infrastructure and the improvement of the social protection of people.
In this context, I would like to note the agreement just signed, under which Russian citizens residing in South Ossetia will be able to use the Russian system of general medical insurance.
Funds from the investment programme are used for the improvement of the capital of the republic, Tskhinval. This concerns housing construction and schools. Recently, a modern children's hospital was opened.
I would like to emphasise that Russia will continue to allocate funds for the development of the republic. A new investment programme for 2018–2019 has already been developed, to be approved shortly. In addition, we have developed a special package of concessional lending for the population and enterprises of South Ossetia totalling over 1 billion rubles. Funds are allocated primarily to improve the agro-industrial sector and support small businesses.

Russia provides assistance in training personnel for the republic, including in departmental educational institutions. At the moment, over 600 citizens of South Ossetia study at Russian universities, with 400 of them studying free of charge, that is, at the expense of the federal budget of the Russian Federation.
Russian regions play a significant role in the economic development of South Ossetia. Eleven regions of the Russian Federation entered into cooperation agreements with the republic, and together with South Ossetian partners, projects are implemented in such areas as industry and agriculture.
Of course, we exchanged views on current regional issues, as I have already said. We agreed to coordinate more closely steps to confront challenges and threats to security in the South Caucasus, and to continue the most robust cooperation possible in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the President of South Ossetia, all our South Ossetian colleagues and friends for a meaningful and good conversation. I am confident that the agreements reached today will contribute to bolstering relations between Russia and South Ossetia and will serve to develop and strengthen the republic.
President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov: Thank you very much.
Colleagues, I think that President Putin has spoken in sufficient detail about the content of our talks; I have nothing to add in general.
The only thing I can add is that, during this period, we have signed about 100 additional agreements between the Russian Federation and the Republic of South Ossetia. Currently there are several other major agreements in our ministries, which will also be signed. They regard simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship and South Ossetian citizens residing in Russia without time limits. There are many agreements that will promote the socio-economic development of the Republic of South Ossetia.

For my part, I would like to say that South Ossetia is taking serious steps to grow its revenues. A large role, of course, is played by the investment programme for socio-economic development, which is now being implemented in South Ossetia. Facilities are already operating that will soon generate revenue for the state budget. Considering all this, we cannot help but be pleased with the progressive development of the Republic of South Ossetia and our bilateral relations.
Thank you very much, Mr Putin.

Beginning of the conversation with President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Bibilov, I am glad to see you.
There is probably no need to delve into recent history. We are aware of what happened ten years ago, back in 2008. The situation has undoubtedly stabilised since then. Russia is doing much to ensure the reliable security – by which I mean military security as well as border security – of South Ossetia.

Thank God, our trade began to grow last year – first by three percent, then by a whopping 48 percent in the first nine months of this year, primarily, of course, due to the textiles coming from South Ossetia.
But we are meeting today to discuss what else should be done to expand the possible range of goods that can reach the Russian market, what should be done in order to create new jobs, what should be done to support the republic’s social sphere.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
President of South Ossetia Anatoly Bibilov
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
Allow me first to thank you for your kind invitation to come to Moscow on an official visit. This is certainly very important for South Ossetia, and I think that the development of our relations to date has been at a fairly high level. If we consider the political component, the interstate component, we already have about a hundred agreements, a number of additional agreements are in the making, and they are exactly the kinds of agreements that will contribute to the advancement of integration processes and the development of our economic relations.
Regarding trade, today thanks to the investment programme geared toward economic development, rather significant steps have been taken. These include the planting of apple orchards, and meat production on the territory of South Ossetia.
There are, of course, certain problems, which are generally solvable, and I do not think there will be any difficulties.
Of course, compared to what happened in 2008, it is night and day in South Ossetia in terms of development. We are gradually forgetting what our children had to go through nine years ago.
We are now focusing on economic development, on the development of the social sphere, and I think it will work out for us thanks to the Russian Federation.
