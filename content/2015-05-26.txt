Beginning of the meeting with Commissioner for Entrepreneurs’ Rights Boris Titov
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
We have just taken part in an event organised by Delovaya Rossiya to consider issues dealing with improving the business climate and the business environment in the Russian Federation.
Now, on Mr Titov’s initiative this group will discuss the 2015 report of the Commissioner for Entrepreneurs’ Rights. We will consider in greater detail some matters that are relevant in this sphere.
This is Mr Titov’s second report in this line of work and it is on his initiative that we are meeting in this expanded format to hear your comments and proposals on the topics that Mr Titov will cover in his report.
Go ahead, please.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your work.
Your colleagues are now working in all 85 of Russia’s federal constituent entities. You said that there are already public agencies operating.
I think we will move in this particular direction so that people engaged in entrepreneurship have someplace to go to ensure their rights are protected aside from law enforcement and judiciary agencies. There is simply no doubt that if our businesses feel protected by the law and instruments like this, they will be even more effective.
Thank you very much.
