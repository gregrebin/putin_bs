At a meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues, let me wish you a warm welcome to Moscow.
France is one of our key partners in Europe and in the world. I am pleased to see that despite the current difficulties, our relations continue to develop practically in all areas. This applies to our ties at the governmental level, business contacts, and ties between our parliaments.
We are very pleased to see you here, Mr Minister. I know that you have a lot of work to do together with [Russian Foreign Minister] Mr Lavrov. I am pleased to have this chance to see you and exchange views on our bilateral relations and their development, and on the main issues on the international agenda.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for this reception here in Moscow. I know that you have a very busy schedule and I thank you for finding time for me.
I am pleased to see you again. I remember our meetings in 2013, when we had a very open, useful and interesting discussion, and I am sure that we need to continue developing our bilateral relations today.
I want to pass on greetings from President [of France] Hollande. At the same time, I want to pass on that our President is looking forward to seeing you in October this year, and I am ready to continue my work with Mr Lavrov. I know that there are quite a few matters we want to discuss. I am sure that this discussion will proceed in a constructive and positive spirit.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Please pass on my warmest wishes to the President of France.
