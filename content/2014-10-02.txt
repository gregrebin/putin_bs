With King Abdullah II of Jordan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, friends, allow me to greet you.
I am very happy that relations between Russia and Jordan are developing and we are in constant contact. We have good joint projects and, what is especially pleasant – our trade turnover has grown significantly in the past year. The figures may not be so great, but the tendency is good. I also look forward to exchanging views on the situation in the region, specifically because it is not improving, unfortunately – it is rather further deteriorating.
Jordan has always played a stabilising role and, as I have said, it will be useful and interesting for me to exchange ideas with you regarding the situation and tendencies for its development.
Welcome.
King Abdullah II
of Jordan (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President, I am very happy to be here again. You are my friend, my brother.
We in Jordan value our personal relations with you and the developing relations between our countries that are becoming ever stronger.
We are very grateful to Russia for the stabilising role it is playing in the region, in the Middle East, considering the complexity of the situation. This primarily applies to the Israel-Palestinian peace process, and Russia plays a very important role – possibly the most important one for the future of Syria. Today, Russia and Jordan stand side-by-side, countering terrorism and extremism in the region and the world at large.
All the above facts make our relations special, closer, and we will discuss all of this today. The world should understand that without Russia it is impossible to make any progress in this region.
I am happy to be here, bearing in mind my previous visit and our communication. I am happy to meet again with my friend and brother, the President of Russia, to discuss pressing issues.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
