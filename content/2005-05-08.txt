President Hotel, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Kurmanbek Salievich, I am very glad to see you and would like to thank you for coming to Moscow for the 60th anniversary of Victory. Today, when we met in a small format, you said correctly that this is our common holiday. We all stress this. And it is very pleasing for me that today you will represent the people of Kyrgyzstan here, at the ceremonies of the 60th anniversary of Victory.
Kurmanbek Bakiev: Thank you once more, Vladimir Vladimirovich, for the invitation.
I believe that the issues which we discussed are very important above all for Kyrgyzstan and for our economy. And I would like to take the opportunity of todayâ€™s meeting to propose once more to return to these issues which were raised at one time, but which were not resolved. I mean our industrial enterprises which are idle, that is they are not working. If you agree, then I will prepare a list of our enterprises which we would like to provide to you as part of the debt to Russia.
Mr Putin: Similar to what Armenia did with us, yes?
Mr Bakiev: Yes.
Mr Putin: Good.
Mr Bakiev: There are enterprises that are not being used, they are idle. Generally, we have enormous unemployment, that is I think that they need to be started up again to solve serious problems.
Mr Putin: An inter-governmental commission needs to work on this.
Mr Bakiev: Of course.
Mr Putin: Good.
