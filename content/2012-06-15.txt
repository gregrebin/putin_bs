Tuapse
With President and Chairman of the Board of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson. On the far right is President and Management Board Chairman of Rosneft Igor Sechin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Tillerson, I am very happy to see you.
This is already our second meeting in a short span of time, and there is a good explanation for this: increasingly close relations are being forged between your company and Russian market players.
Just now, you signed documents on working jointly with Rosneft on hard-to-recover oil reserves and the continental shelf. This is the best proof that economic relations between the United States and Russia are continuing to develop.
We very much expect that our collaboration will benefit the global energy market, both companies, and our economies. I think that within the difficult conditions of the world economy, this is a good signal that all the market players in a wide range of economic sectors can feel confident.
Welcome.
ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson: Thank you, Mr President, for those warm remarks and your welcome. I also appreciate very much your attending today the signing of our two agreements.
As you point out, these two agreements represent continued progress in our very broad strategic partnership between Rosneft and ExxonMobil. It is important progress and substantive progress, and I’m pleased that you were here to be part of the signing today, and very much appreciate the strong support and encouragement you have provided to our partnership.
I agree, as you point out, that nothing strengthens relationships between countries better than business enterprise. And these agreements will serve to strengthen our relationship between our two countries and obviously our two companies.
We are very proud of our partnership. We look forward to bringing what we have to offer, our technical expertise to Russia, but also continuing to learn from Rosneft about Russian resources, techniques that are used here that are successful. It will be a very strong partnership.
Vladimir Putin: How do you view cooperation to develop the technological centre in St Petersburg?
Rex Tillerson: Well, I’m very excited about the establishment of the Arctic Research Centre. ExxonMobil has a long history of more than 30 years of research in Arctic technology that we utilised in Alaska, as well as at offshore sites. But we know Rosneft also has years of technological expertise working in Siberia. I have no doubt that putting our two companies together, we are going to develop new approaches and new techniques that are going to allow us to access resources in the Russian Arctic efficiently, safely, with a great deal of care for the environment.

Speech at the opening of a deep-water oil terminal

Tuapse
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I want first of all to thank the management and all of the staff of Rosneft.
Russia’s oil and gas sector is without question a driving force for the entire national economy, and Rosneft has established itself as a leader in this sector of such importance for us. It is a leader not just here in Russia, which is in itself welcome of course, but competes successfully with our partners and friends too, and last year became the world’s top producer of oil specifically, inching ahead just a little of our friends and competitors from ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil’s President is here with us today, so let’s wish him welcome, all the more so as we are developing excellent and indeed strategic cooperation with ExxonMobil.
As for the Tuapse Oil Refinery, it is a good example of development for Rosneft and the sector as a whole. This oil refinery has been around for a long time, it opened in 1929, and the technology it used was even older, dating back to 1927–28. It is very good to see that Rosneft is now investing serious funds in the refinery’s modernisation. 
Rosneft President Igor Sechin
spoke just before about the production side of things, and the results are indeed impressive. I want to mention another aspect however, the environmental aspect. What is important is that Rosneft is investing not only in state of the art technological chains and equipment lines, including together with our foreign partners, but is investing in the environmental side of things too. 
The modernisation work will involve building completely new treatment facilities and reinforcing coastal protection so as to ensure that no harmful products make their way into the Tuapse River. The sanitary protection environmental zone around the refinery will be redeveloped.
This shows just how closely and attentively the Russian Government is monitoring the situation here. It means that the area will be able to continue playing its traditional role of health resort and holiday zone for our people. I want to thank all of you for this work. 
I congratulate you on this new stage in your work.
