The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: I wanted just to see you and talk about the situation with building the republic’s statehood. There are various events coming up. We recently sent ambassadors to each other’s countries and the final decision is being prepared right now on the locations for diplomatic missions in Moscow and Sukhumi. In my opinion, as far as our diplomatic relations go, everything is progressing as normal. But there are also more important and substantial matters we should discuss today, I think.
But before we start our work, I want to congratulate you on your birthday. On this day, your 60th birthday, I offer you my sincere congratulations and wish you good health and energy.
President of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh: Thank you very much for your attention and congratulations.
As you said, work is going ahead. Many documents have already been submitted on the diplomatic side, and the main agreements on essential work between our finance ministries, work on an agreement between our banks, are in preparation. I will inform you of all the details.
What is most important is that everything is going ahead according to schedule. This is complex work. Each document requires thorough and all-round examination, but so far everything is going without problem.
Dmitry Medvedev: Good. Let’s discuss all of this.
