The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
Another year has gone by. And at this moment we are remembering what we consider to be of the greatest importance to us. One way or another we are symbolically summing up our experience. And the whole country is summing up the results of the year.
On this New Year’s night I thank you for everything. For everything that we have achieved in the past year. What lies ahead depends on what has already been done. Each of us had his own experiences this year. But now, not forgetting about the past, we think of course of the future. So first of all I hope that all your wishes will be fulfilled. I want all your plans and your thoughts and wishes to be fulfilled. Let all your good undertakings, plans and ideas come to fruition.
May the New Year bring all of you success in all your deeds. They add up to our common life. They add up to the destiny of the country, the destiny of Russia.
May your parents and children be healthy. May there be peace and prosperity in every home.
I congratulate you all on the New Year. Those who are celebrating it with their families and friends, and those who on this New Year night are far away from home.
We are on the threshold of the third year of the third millennium. Russia, a country with a thousand year history, has a worthy record as it faces its future.
We have a wonderful old tradition of presenting gifts to each other on the New Year holiday. Today let us give our close ones the most valuable and the most cherished gift: warmth, care and affection.
A Happy New Year, dear friends!
