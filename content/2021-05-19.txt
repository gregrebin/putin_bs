Instructions on implementing President’s Address to Federal Assembly
May 2, 2021
I would like to remind you that these vital decisions have to do with the creation of an integral system of support for Russian families with children, the further development of our education and healthcare systems, environmental protection, additional incentives for domestic businesses, including the high-tech sectors, and the creation of new opportunities for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation to for developing infrastructure, the economy, labour market and social sphere.
Of course, you know that the main points of the Address were not drafted and formulated from scratch. This called for large-scale preliminary work involving you, the Government, colleagues from the Presidential Executive Office and parliamentary parties.

Instructions following a meeting on implementing certain provisions of the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly
June 5, 2021
The United Russia party contributed a substantial share of proposals. Today, I would like to ask Mr Turchak to discuss the implementation of the new legislative initiatives.
On the whole, I would like to draw the attention of Government members, colleagues in the regions, deputies and senators to the fact that I am expecting a smooth and effective fulfilment of the instructions contained in the Address. Colleagues, all tasks that we have jointly set should be accomplished in the same way and with the same results as expected by Russian citizens.
At today’s meeting, I suggest that we focus on two most important issues that have to be resolved right away.
First, the summer vacation season is beginning. Many families are choosing or have already chosen their holiday destinations and summer camps where their children will stay. Of course, vacation costs are a key issue here. I repeat, people should understand what support the state will provide in this regard.
The Address called for the extension of the tourism expenses cashback programme until late 2021. The programme should also cover young people, including the finalists and winners of Olympiads, volunteer and creative competitions, during the summer holidays. Children staying at summer camps will be entitled to a 50 percent reimbursement of the cost. I would like to discuss this issue with you in greater detail because I can see some problems here already.
I would like to note that all decisions on this issue should have already been made. Today, I would like to ask you to report how this instruction has been fulfilled, how the new national tourism project is proceeding, and how you are cooperating with the business community in order to strengthen the country’s tourism industry.
Second, I would like to note today that the Address prioritises infrastructure development. This implies the construction of motorways and other transport facilities, the renewal of housing and utilities systems, and other aspects that largely determine the quality of people’s lives in cities and villages, and which are a highly important factor of growth, expanded business activity, and which also help create new enterprises and jobs.
It is vital for the investment in infrastructure to provide a powerful impetus for the comprehensive development of Russia’s regions and territories and to be complemented with an increase of investment by private businesses. Therefore, just as I pointed out in the Address, we must offer new tools for financing such long-term investment.
I am referring first of all to the budgetary loans issued at a law interest rate for at least 15 years with a grace period. These funds are to be attracted by the regional authorities for investment in the construction and renovation of engineering, utilities, social and tourist infrastructure, just as we agreed to do. We must ensure the provision of infrastructure loans to all Federation entities capable of servicing them.
I would like to remind you that we decided, seeking to expand the regions’ access to development tools, to reduce their debt burden, replace expensive commercial loans with budgetary loans, and restructure the budgetary loans that were issued last year. I would like you to report today on the actual parameters of the provision of infrastructure loans and the lending procedure, as well as to provide details of the planned replacement of commercial debts with budgetary loans.
Colleagues, I would like to point out that we have agreed to increase the amount of projects financed with infrastructure loans to at least 500 billion rubles by 2024.
The Government is already analysing such projects that involve state and private businesses. I mentioned them in my Address, as you may recall. They are the Northern Latitudinal Railway and the development of municipal transport in million-plus cities: Nizhny Novgorod, Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk.
We must develop clear and smooth interaction with all the members of this process. I would like to draw the attention of our largest companies, primarily Russian Railways and Gazprom, to the following: colleagues, you must join these activities energetically, coordinating and synchronising your investment plans and programmes with the regions’ new possibilities in the field of infrastructure development.
Of course, I would also like to point out once again that the Government must provide the necessary assistance to the regions for the implementation of these and other infrastructure projects, including a comprehensive spatial development and new housing construction projects.
As I noted in the Address, we must launch a mechanism for subsidising the bonds that will be placed by the DOM.RF development institute, which will give developers an opportunity to take out special-purpose loans at the lowest possible interest rate and to increase the scale of residential housing construction, thus making housing more affordable for Russian families.
I would like you to expand on this subject today and to report on the implementation of this instruction.
Let us begin with an overview of the implementation of the objectives set out in the Address. I would like Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to do this.
