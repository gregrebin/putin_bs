Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled the Memorial Candle monument dedicated to the residents and defenders of besieged Leningrad.
The ceremony was also attended by President of Israel Reuven Rivlin
, Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion and St Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov
.
A joint creation of St Petersburg and Israeli architects, the monument has been erected in Sacher Park in the centre of Jerusalem. A capsule with soil from the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery in St Petersburg, the largest burial ground for victims of WWII, was placed in the memorial’s foundation.
The idea of the memorial was proposed by war veterans, siege survivors and compatriots living in Israel, and was supported by Jewish associations of Russia and Israel.

Speech at the ceremony to unveil the monument
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear war veterans, Mr President, Mr Prime Minister and spouse, Mr Mayor and spouse, friends,
It is a great honour for me to attend this ceremony held to dedicate a monument to the heroic defenders and residents of Leningrad. We are unveiling this monument ahead of the events that have special significance for our countries and nations.
One of the most dramatic and heroic moments in the history of WWII ended on January 27, 1944: the siege of Leningrad was finally lifted.
Exactly one year later – my colleagues already spoke about this here – on January 27, 1945, the Red Army liberated the prisoners of one of the largest Nazi death camps – Auschwitz. This day is now International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
There are many examples known throughout history of incredible stamina, sacrifice and horrible human tragedies. But it is impossible to compare the siege of Leningrad and the Holocaust with anything else.
The sacred memory of the martyrdom and courage of millions of people, incomprehensible losses, privations and heroism and our common fair anger at what the Nazis did is passed on from one generation to another.
The whole world knows about the siege of Leningrad and the neighbouring villages, and the unparalleled courage of their residents and defenders. But no documents, stories or diaries can describe what the people went through at that time.
My colleagues have just spoken about this. For me these are no mere words, I know this not from hearsay but from what my parents told me because my farther defended his native city at the front lines, and my mother was in the besieged city with a child that died in the winter of 1942 and was buried at the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery in St Petersburg among hundreds of thousands of other residents.
The enemy’s plan was absolutely cynical: to doom the city’s residents to death by starvation and, to quote a Nazi order, “to raze to the ground by permanent bombing.”
However, the enemy could not execute this order that is fixed in documents. The residents of Leningrad, people of different ethnic origins, did not give up. They did not spare themselves either at the frontline where incessant fighting went on, or in factories that continuously produced ammunition and hardware required by the front.
I have just mentioned hardware and ammunition. I did not know this but while looking through documents several days ago I discovered a fact that shocked me. During the siege, Leningrad residents donated 144 tonnes of blood for the front despite the situation they were in.
Deprived of food, light and heating, they continued working in hospitals and being involved in art, science and education, and by sacrificing themselves, they saved the great city for generations to come. Invincible Leningrad has become a true legend, while the grandeur of the strength of mind of its residents and their faith in victory has become the acme of human dignity.
The monument we have unveiled today is a symbol of our profound common memory. The idea to create it belongs to the devoted members of the Israeli public, war veterans, and our compatriots, and it was created with the support of the authorities of St Petersburg and Jerusalem, with funding provided by benefactors from both countries.
I would like to note with gratitude and appreciation that Israel attaches special importance to preserving the truth about the Soviet Union’s decisive contribution to victory over Nazism. People here, like in Russia, are concerned, alarmed and outraged by attempts to deny the Holocaust, revise results of WWII, and to whitewash murderers and criminals.
This is the second monument that we have jointly unveiled on Israeli soil over recent years (as Mr Prime Minister has just mentioned). The first monument was erected in the city of Netanya and immortalised the memory of the feats of valor committed by Red Army officers and men. An honest and utterly respectful attitude to Soviet soldiers has found a reflection in the displays at the Yad Vashem Memorial to European Jewish Holocaust victims.
We also hold dear the name of the monument that has been unveiled today. Every year, on June 22, the day when the Great Patriotic War began, the Memorial Candle function starts in Russia at four in the morning, with people in all cities and villages lighting candles in a sign of mourning for those who perished in that dreadful war. St Petersburg, formerly Leningrad, is where this tradition came into being in 2009. Now there is a candle of memory in Israel as well, where almost 1,300 survivors of the siege of Leningrad, their descendants and friends live and where people revere their heroes and remember the dead.
Here, like in Russia, people understand the importance of the lessons of WWII and are not allowing the world to forget what national egoism, disunity and connivance at any forms of chauvinism, antisemitism and Russo-phobia can lead to.
Our common duty is to pass this knowledge on to the coming generations, the great grandsons of the victors, while inculcating in them a thankful memory of those who have given us the gift of freedom and proved, at the cost of their lives, the enduring value of peace and justice.
In conclusion, I would like to say just a few more words. A monument is a very good thing; it will remain here for a long time, hopefully for centuries. It can be unveiled in different ways. But the way you did this today… Thank you.

Meeting with President of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas
Vladimir Putin and President of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas held talks in Bethlehem.
January 23, 2020
21:00
Bethlehem
President of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas (retranslated): In the name of Allah, the Merciful and the Compassionate, I would like to welcome the esteemed Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Federation, my personal friend, and a friend of all Palestinians, who will not miss an opportunity to draw the attention of the international community to the Palestinian issue or to render us comprehensive assistance. We have become very accustomed to this.
Naturally, we attach much importance to the regular exchange of visits at top level – visits to Moscow and your visit to Palestine – to compare notes and exchange views on the issues that are of interest to the Russian Federation and the State of Palestine.
I would like to thank you for your all-round support. I am referring to political, economic and cultural assistance, financial cooperation and aid to Palestine in the area of security.
I would like to thank you for your support and the work that you do in our area, I am referring to the Arab world. We consider this confirmation of the fact that Arab affairs are important to the Russian Federation. Russia is always present in the Arab world and is always working to resolve its problems.
Naturally, we have a number of issues to discuss. I am primarily referring to Israel’s statement on the annexation of Palestinian lands, and the likelihood of an announcement on the second part of “the deal of the century” by Trump. As you know, the Americans have already made public the first part. We must also discuss the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections in the State of Palestine. These are the issues we would like to review.
Mr President, allow us to welcome you to the State of Palestine once again. I hope I will have an opportunity to personally congratulate you on the victory over Nazism in Moscow in May.
Welcome.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very happy to see you.
We meet regularly and are always in contact.
Russian-Palestinian ties have long and deep roots. We maintain relations in the most diverse areas. You have just mentioned them. We are interested in building up our cooperation in the economy and humanitarian areas and, of course, on issues related to an Arab-Israeli settlement. We understand your concerns in this respect.
I am very happy to have this opportunity to hold consultations with you on all of these issues, including, of course, in a broader context, the situation in the region as a whole.
Of course, we are looking forward to seeing you in Moscow in May for the Day of Victory over Nazism.

Meeting with President of Israel Reuven Rivlin
During his visit to Israel, Vladimir Putin had a meeting with President of Israel Reuven Rivlin.
January 23, 2020
12:45
Jerusalem
1 of 4
With President of Israel Reuven Rivlin.
President of Israel Reuven Rivlin
(retranslated): It is a great honour to receive one of the world’s main leaders today.
We are meeting with you and, of course, the Minister of Foreign Affairs who ranks among the world’s main ministers today.
Mr President, I would like to convey my best wishes to you and Russia, and may God bless Jerusalem and the President’s residence.
We are deeply moved by this date that we are marking today – the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.
Of course, consensus has been reached on the international arena that manifestations of anti-Semitism, xenophobia and fascism are unacceptable.
And, of course, you, as a representative of the family of the world’s nations, and we know where anti-Semitism comes from. However, we do not know where it ends. Naturally, it is therefore important that we fight it together.
And, of course, it is impossible to conduct this war without Russia taking an active part in it.
Mr President, we are very happy to welcome you.
I would also like to express profound satisfaction with the efforts that you are making because virtually every one of our citizens is our child.
The Chief of the Israeli General Staff is also present here. He has arrived here to welcome you and to become acquainted with you. Naturally, he did not assume his position just because his relatives come from Russia.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: This played a certain part. (Laughter.)
Mr President, thank you very much for your invitation.
It is very important for me and for my colleagues to be here in Israel. We can see your efforts and the efforts of all Israeli leaders to preserve the memory of the tragic events of World War II.
You have just said that it is unclear where anti-Semitism ends. Unfortunately, we know this: it ends in Auschwitz. Therefore, we need to be very attentive so as not to miss any similar developments in the future and to counter any manifestations of xenophobia and anti-Semitism, no matter where this may happen, and no matter from where this may come.
Not only did the Red Army liberate Auschwitz, but it made a decisive contribution to the fight against Nazism. And the Soviet people, Russian people suffered greatly during this war.
Regarding the tragedy of the Holocaust, Soviet Jews accounted for 40 percent of the Jews who were murdered and tortured to death. This is our common tragedy in the full sense of the word.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here with you today.

President presents Order of Courage to relative of Leon Feldhendler

Vladimir Putin presented the Order of Courage to Nitza Shacham, the great-niece of Leon Feldhendler, hero of the uprising at the Sobibor death camp.
In July 2019, the President of Russia signed an Executive Order posthumously awarding Leon Feldhendler for his personal courage and heroism in organising the uprising at the Sobibor death camp.
Born in 1910 in Turobin, Poland, Leon Feldhendler was sent to the Sobibor concentration camp in autumn 1942, where he led an underground group. After the arrival of Soviet prisoners of war in September 1943, he teamed up with Soviet officer Alexander Pechersky to organise the only successful uprising in a Nazi camp. After the liberation of eastern Poland by the Red Army, Feldhendler moved to Lublin. In April 1945, he was killed under still unclear circumstances.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
Today we are conferring the Order of Courage to the family of World War II hero Leon Feldhendler.
This award is a symbol of the deep respect that the people of Russia have for this brave man, a tribute to his memory and recognition of his achievement that gave people hope and life.
Leon Feldhendler knew difficult times. He lost his parents, his wife and sons, and suffered unbearable torture and horrors in the ghetto and at the Sobibor death camp, and he witnessed the consistent and cold-blooded extermination of many thousands of people.
But he did not lose heart; he showed the will to live and to win. He organised an international underground group at the camp and raised the hopes of the emaciated and exhausted prisoners who had lost all faith in justice or hope for life, and encouraged them to fight.
He established contact with the Soviet prisoners of war who arrived at the camp, including the fearless Soviet officer Alexander Pechersky. Together they became the inspirers and leaders of an unprecedented uprising of prisoners at the Sobibor camp. Their feat is a great role model, and is forever carved into world history.
Russia values Israel’s efforts to preserve the memory of our common fight against Nazism, of the heroes and victims of World War II. Together we will work for the sake of present and future generations and make sure all people know about the horrors of that war and the truth about it.
Thank you.
Award ceremony.
Nitza Shacham (retranslated): Thank you very much.
I am very emotional and very grateful to you, Mr President, for the opportunity to pass on this story to future generations.
We are a small family that keeps the memory of those who passed. And following today's event, we will be able to keep Leon’s memory and pass it on to future generations.
Vladimir Putin: Once again I would like to wish you all the best.
For us in Russia, the memory of people like your ancestor is sacred. We can see that the memory of such people is as sacred in Israel.
I wish you all the very best.

Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism forum
Vladimir Putin took part in the commemorative event held as part of the Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism international forum at the Yad Vashem memorial complex.
January 23, 2020

At the Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism forum.
The international forum held in Jerusalem on January 22–23 is timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp and International Holocaust Remembrance Day marked on January 27. On this day in 1945, Soviet troops, which made a crucial contribution to the Victory over Nazi Germany, liberated Auschwitz.
The Yad Vashem memorial complex underwent major renovations in 2005. A new display features documents and exhibits dedicated to the life of European Jews on the eve of World War II and the inhuman suffering inflicted upon them by the Nazis.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
Today we are brought together at the international forum to honour the victims of the Holocaust by a shared responsibility, our duty to the past and the future.
We mourn all the victims of the Nazis, including the six million Jews tortured in ghettos and death camps and killed cruelly during raids. Forty percent of them were citizens of the Soviet Union, so the Holocaust has always been a deep wound for us, a tragedy we will always remember.
Before visiting Jerusalem, I looked through original documents, reports by Red Army officers after the liberation of Auschwitz. I must tell you, colleagues, it is very difficult, unbearable to read these military reports, documents describing in detail how the camp was set up, how the cold-blooded killing machine worked.
Many of them were hand-written by soldiers and officers of the Red Army on the second or third day after the liberation of the prisoners and convey the shock that the Red Army soldiers and officers experienced from what they saw there, from testimonies that caused pain, indignation and compassion.
Red Army Field Marshal Konev, who then led the military operation to capture the densely populated Silesian industrial region of Germany, used tactics to spare as many civilians as possible and, having received a report about the atrocities committed at Auschwitz, forbade himself from even seeing this camp. Later he wrote in his memoirs that he had no right to lose his moral strength, so that a fair sense of revenge would not have blinded him during military operations and would not have caused additional suffering and casualties among the civilian population of Germany.
January 27 marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. In this hell, where people from different countries were brought for torture, monstrous experiments and mass killing, hundreds of thousands of people of different ethnicities died. More than half of them were Jews.
The crimes committed by the Nazis, their deliberate, planned, and as they said, ”final solution to the Jewish issue,“ is one of the darkest and most shameful pages of modern world history.
But we should not forget that this crime also had accomplices. They were often crueler than their masters. Death factories and concentration camps were served not only by the Nazis, but also by their accomplices in many European countries.
In the occupied territories of the Soviet Union, where these criminals were operating, the largest number of Jews were killed. Thus, about 1.4 million Jews were killed in Ukraine, and 220,000 people were killed in Lithuania. I draw your attention, friends, to the fact that this is 95 percent of the pre-war Jewish population of this country. In Latvia, 77,000 Jewish people were killed. Only a few hundred Latvian Jews survived the Holocaust.
The Holocaust was deliberate annihilation of people. But we must remember that the Nazis intended the same fate for many other peoples. Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles and many other peoples were declared Untermensch. Their land was meant to serve as living space for the Nazis, providing for their prosperous existence, while the Slavs and other peoples were meant either to be exterminated or to become slaves without rights, culture, historical memory and language.
Back in 1945, it was first of all the Soviet people who put an end to these barbaric plans. As it has just been said, they protected their Fatherland and liberated Europe from Nazism. We paid a price no nation could even imagine in their worst dreams: a toll of 27 million deaths.
We will never forget this. The memory of the Holocaust will serve as a lesson and a warning only if it remains fully intact, without any omissions. Unfortunately, today the memory of war and its lessons and legacy often fall subject to the immediate political situation. This is completely unacceptable. It is the duty of current and future politicians, state and public figures to protect the good name of the living and fallen heroes, civilians and victims of the Nazis and their allies.
We must use everything we have – our informational, political and cultural capabilities as well as the reputation and influence our countries have in the world – to this end. I am sure that everyone present here today, in this audience, shares these concerns and is ready to protect truth and justice together with us.
We are all responsible for making sure that the terrible tragedies of this war will not happen again, that the generations to come will remember the horrors of the Holocaust, the death camps and the siege of Leningrad – Prime Minister Netanyahu has just said that today a monument to the victims of the siege was unveiled here in Jerusalem – Babi Yar, and the burned-down village of Khatyn, remember that we must remain alert and must not overlook when the first seeds of hate, chauvinism and antisemitism take root, or when people start to indulge in xenophobia or other similar manifestations.
Destruction of the past and lack of unity in the face of threats can lead to terrible consequences. We must have the courage to be straight about this and do everything to defend peace.
I think an example could and should be set by the founding countries of the United Nations, the five powers that bear special responsibility for the preservation of civilisation.
We have discussed this with several of our colleagues and, as far as I know, have received a generally positive response to holding a meeting of the heads of state of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain. We can hold it in any country, in any place that our colleagues would find convenient. Russia is ready for such a serious discussion. We intend to send this proposal to the leaders of the Five without delay.
We are faced with many challenges. We discussed one of them recently at the initiative of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. This is about Libya. But we will have to return to this issue at the Security Council and adopt a relevant resolution.
There are many other problems as well. I consider it important and symbolic to hold the proposed meeting this year. After all, we are celebrating 75 years since the end of World War II and the foundation of the United Nations.
A summit of the states that made the main contribution to the routing of the aggressor and the formation of the postwar world order can play a big role in searching for collective ways of responding to current challenges and threats and would demonstrate our common commitment to the spirit of allied relations, historical memory and the lofty ideals and values for which our predecessors, our grandfathers and fathers fought shoulder to shoulder.
In conclusion, I would like to thank our Israeli colleagues for a warm, very hospitable reception here in Jerusalem, and to wish peace, prosperity and all the best to everyone at the conference, and, of course, to the citizens of Israel.
Thank you.

Yaffa Issachar (retranslated): I am touched that you wanted to see me, that you were willing to make time for me. I am very nervous.
It is reassuring that you are a friend of Israel and of our Prime Minister Netanyahu.

I am asking you, Mr President, please bring her home. I miss her very much and want to hug her.
Over the nine months I spent in the Jewish community in Moscow, I realised how well they thought of you, with great respect. There is no antisemitism or xenophobia there. I realised that this is so thanks to your efforts. This is why you are respected so much. I thank you very much.
I am an ordinary person that is meeting with you at the Prime Minister’s residence. I am asking you once again to pardon her and send her home, back to me, because she is my life. I have two daughters, and they are my world.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I understand.
