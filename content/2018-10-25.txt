Alexander Osipov
: The implementation of large projects is an important issue. The work has started on several large-scale projects in Trans-Baikal Territory, including the development of the Bystrinskoye poly-metallic deposit, the Argunskoye uranium deposit and others.
To secure their stable and successful operation, a supporting infrastructure is required, including the construction of social facilities for the personnel of the enterprises that are being established.

I ask for your support as regards the development of the plan on providing social security to the areas of growth. Similar plans have been developed and are currently implemented in the Far Eastern Federal District
. If you support the plan, we will develop it and then submit it for approval and financing.
I would ask for your support and assistance in expanding the measures and support mechanisms that are commonly used in the Far East now and have proven their efficiency.
These include creating priority development areas, infrastructure subsidies for investment projects being implemented, and offering land plots of one hectare to residents for free.
Among such measures are also the use of support mechanisms envisaged by the law on the Free Port of Vladivostok, such as the 24/7 work of local checkpoints, where we are experiencing problems at the moment. People and vehicles have to wait for two or three days and cannot complete the formalities on time. This is a tense situation that needs to be resolved.
The support tools used in the Free Port of Vladivostok that can be helpful include the 24/7 work of checkpoints, accelerated procedures for control over transportation vehicles that cross the border, and creating a free customs zone.
There are also electronic visas for entrants, with the procedure simplified and a greater number of tourists arriving.
