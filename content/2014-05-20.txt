Russian-Chinese talks in expanded format.
President of the People’S Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Once again, I would like to welcome you, my dear friend, President Putin, on your visit to China.
In February, we had a successful meeting in Sochi. We set the targets for promoting Russian-Chinese relations for the subsequent period and gave a good start to the development of bilateral relations this year. In the time after the February meeting, the intergovernmental commission of our two states has been actively working to implement our agreements. Some significant progress has been made and a lot of work has been done to prepare this meeting.
After the negotiations, we will sign an important statement that will demonstrate our intention to strengthen mutual support, expand cooperation and improve the coordination of our diplomatic efforts to raise our relations, our cooperation and partnership to a higher level.
A number of important agreements and contracts have been signed in our presence. Your current visit will be very fruitful. The further development of Russian-Chinese comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation based on mutual interest and dictated by the need to promote justice and equality in the world, maintain peace on the planet, by the need to achieve the joint prosperity of China and Russia, is an inevitable choice that proceeds from the process of forming a multi-polar world. This policy finds the support of the broadest communities within our countries. We need to support and strengthen our efforts. We should not be satisfied with our achievements, but rather consistently work for greater success in our cooperation.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, our Chinese friends,
In an atmosphere of trust and friendship, we have just had an exchange of views on the development of bilateral relations and international issues. Now, as we meet in expanded format, we have the opportunity to hear our colleagues. However, even after the first part of our conversation it is clear to all that our countries have made an enormous effort to bring our relations to an absolutely new level of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.
China is firmly occupying the position of our leading trade partner. Trade turnover between our countries in 2013 grew by almost 2 percent to reach $90 billion. This positive tendency continues with the growth in the first quarter of this year of another 2 percent. If we maintain these rates, by 2015 we will reach a $100 billion mark and continue moving ahead.
At the same time, we expect quantitative indexes to be accompanied by change in the quality of our trade and economic relations. This requires expanding mutual investment. The first Russian-Chinese EXPO to be held this summer in Harbin is to serve this very goal. We also invite our Chinese friends to become our partner nation at INNOPROM 2015, the major international industrial trade fair in Russia, to be held in Yekaterinburg in July 2015.
We should improve the structure of our trade with an accent on such high technology areas as civil aviation, space industry and nuclear power.
We are successfully implementing a number of projects in the humanitarian sphere. 2012 was the year of Russian Tourism in China, and 2013 – the Year of Chinese Tourism in Russia. We have also launched a new important project – the Year of Youth Exchanges. Progress is being made on the program to establish a branch of Moscow State University in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. An intergovernmental agreement to simplify mutual travel for our citizens came into effect on April 26.1 of 2
Meeting with President of Mongolia Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the Shanghai events. Our relations have traditionally been very warm and friendly in nature. Currently, Russia firmly holds second place as Mongolia’s trade partner. We have many, or in any case, we have good joint ventures, large ones, which we have inherited from previous years, but we also have good prospects. So I am very happy for the opportunity to meet and talk with you.
In the lobby, you and I just discussed the events pertaining to the well-known developments on the eve of World War II – the battle at Khalkhin Gol. Of course, we should think about how we can hold all these events together and how to move forward, in the sense of good political relations, the level of political contacts, how to transform them into developing the economy.
President OF MONGOLIA TSAKHIAGIIN ELBEGDORJ: Thank you very much.
To save time, I will speak in Russian.
Thank you, Mr President, for providing this opportunity.
We traditionally have good relations and many opportunities. I will focus on three issues, three topics. The first, of course, is the issue of connecting railways and transport. As you know, Mongolia is a nation that lies entirely between Russia and China. The shortest path is via railways. So we should probably consider how we can take advantage of these opportunities, how to implement major economic projects, infrastructure projects. We are also working on a draft trilateral agreement on through transit, as well as a bilateral agreement between our nations on through transit. In addition, we are about to renew the 1949 agreements on establishing the Ulaanbaatar Railway.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Secretary-General, colleagues, I am very happy to have the opportunity to see you again, this time in Shanghai. We see the intensive work of the United Nations Secretariat on key issues of the international agenda.
As you know, Russia is taking a very active stance in international affairs, specifically within the UN framework, which we believe is the only multifaceted international organisation, the only effective decision-making instrument on the most pressing international issues of our time.
I am very happy to maintain a working relationship with you.
Un Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon: Thank you, Mr President. I would like to thank you for receiving me during this CICA meeting despite your very busy schedule.
I know you are a hard worker. Meeting with you at 10 pm means that you are working very hard and very much committed to peace and security in the world.
I would like to express my sincere condolences on the train collision, which happened near Moscow.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, I have been informed already, I am aware of the human casualties. We are taking all necessary measures to help the injured. And we will help the victims’ families. Repair works on the railway tracks is underway. There will certainly be a thorough investigation of the accident.
Ban Ki-Moon: My deepest condolences to them and a speedy recovery to those other people, and I hope all will be taken care of well under your leadership.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
Ban Ki-Moon: Mr President, I have limited time and I would like to continue our discussion of the situation in Ukraine and, time permitting, I would like to again touch briefly on the current situation in Syria.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to see you and to have the opportunity to exchange views about developing our bilateral relations, as well as the situation in the region.
There were different periods in the history of relations between our nations, but ultimately, the main trend in our relationship has always been an aspiration toward good neighbourly relations and developing cooperation. In recent years, with your direct participation and support, we have built very neighbourly, friendly relations, seeking ways to develop our contacts in the economic, political and humanitarian sectors. Thanks to your efforts, Afghanistan has made great strides in stabilising the domestic situation, developing the economic and social spheres, and building its armed forces. You have also done a great deal to successfully hold the first phase of the presidential election campaign.
I want to thank you for our joint work in recent years and express my hope that the second phase of the elections will be achieved and your successor will do everything to continue all that you have done to build Russian-Afghanistani relations.
President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President.
I am happy to be here today. As a citizen of Afghanistan, I would like to say that I am happy the historical relationship between Russia and Afghanistan has been restored. I would like to note your exceptional role in the development of these relations, in the fact that when participating in the international community, you helped us overcome the difficult situation we found ourselves in and achieve the state of affairs we are reaching today.
I want to thank you for understanding the difficult situation we found ourselves in and helping us further develop our nation.

Press statement following Russian-Chinese talks
May 20, 2014
10:30
Shanghai
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, ladies and gentlemen, friends,
Today in a traditionally friendly and business-like atmosphere, we have covered a broad agenda of Russian-Chinese cooperation and set ourselves ambitious goals and established long-term milestones. We have signed a number of important bilateral documents. Relations between Russia and the People’s Republic of China are developing successfully and have reached a new level of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.
During our negotiations, we paid special attention to economic issues. China is Russia’s leading foreign trade partner. Last year, trade turnover between our countries amounted to almost $90 billion, and we will work to bring it to $100 billion. We have everything we need to achieve this.
A Russian-Chinese Investment Committee has been set up to continue efforts to expand mutual investment. There are a number of major business initiatives in the energy sector. We are working in all areas, and we are making progress everywhere.
In the course of the meeting, we also considered ways of diversifying trade and reducing its dependence on the global economic situation. We will promote cooperation in technology-intensive areas, such as civil aviation. We have good prospects here, projects to create wide-bodied aircraft and civil heavy-lift helicopters. We are also developing cooperation in car manufacturing.
Cooperation between banks is also growing, and we will continue developing the financial infrastructure. Work is underway to increase the amount of mutual payments in national currencies, and we intend to consider new financial instruments.
Cooperation in military technology, supervised by our countries’ defence ministries, is a separate issue. This is an important factor of stability and security in the region and the world at large.
We see a great future in expanding cooperation between individual regions of our countries. A number of Russian regions, including such metropolitan cities as Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as the Volga Region and others, are cooperating directly with partners in China.
Humanitarian ties are becoming ever more important. In March, we launched reciprocal Youth Friendly Exchanges years. We also resolved to create a Russian-Chinese University on the basis of Moscow State University and Beijing University of Technology.
Mr President has already said that the historical memory of the great heroism of our peoples in World War II brings Russia and China even closer. We have agreed to hold joint celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of Victory.
In the course of our detailed exchange, we also covered international issues. I will note that the positions of Russia and China largely coincide. We share the same priorities both on a global and regional scale. We have agreed on closer coordination of our foreign policy actions, including those made within the framework of the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
, BRICS
, APEC and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, which begins its meeting tonight.
I am grateful to the President of China and to all our Chinese friends and partners for a very constructive meeting held today and earlier as we prepared the visit. Thank you for the invitation to visit the People’s Republic of China and to attend the coming events. I am happy to accept.
Thank you.

The President of Russia thanked Jiang Zemin for his contribution to the development of Russian-Chinese relations, noting that the current authorities of China are following this course. Vladimir Putin said Russia and China have many joint plans and are determined to implement them.
* * *
Jiang Zemin (In Russian): How are you?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Everything is great, thanks!
I want to say that the work you started, building Russian-Chinese relations, is now in safe hands. With your input, we have resolved a very important, key issue in our relations – the issue of borders. Today, we do not have a single problem with China that might burden our relations. Both the previous leadership of the People’s Republic of China and President Xi Jinping and his entire team are doing a great deal to further expand our interstate relations. Hu Jintao made his input; Mr Xi Jinping will take further steps, and is making great progress in moving forward. We do not have any discrepancies. On the contrary, we only have major plans that we are fully resolved to implement.
Today’s visit has been very successful. I want to once again thank you for giving so much momentum to the development of our interstate ties.
Jiang Zemin (retranslated): Mr President, I am very happy for the opportunity to meet with you. I fully recall our meeting six years ago, when you were in Beijing at the Olympics opening ceremony. It has been 13 years since we first met. I must say that time flies very quickly.
