The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Dear comrades!
It is thanks to your efforts that one of the cruellest, bloodiest and most repulsive armed groups in our country was eliminated.
You all know that people have been expecting this result for a long time and have the right to demand such coordinated, purposeful work from our law enforcement agencies.
Ensuring citizens’ safety is one of the state’s most important tasks and for that reason strengthening the Armed Forces, the special services and law enforcement agencies will remain one of our priorities.
The threat posed by bandits is still very real. Therefore the main condition for our success will be our ability act in an anticipatory way, just as we did in this instance.
