President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, I am very glad to have the opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the BRICS summit.
I am very pleased, Mr Prime Minister, that our meetings are taking place regularly. This gives us the opportunity to support the high level of our relations in practically every area, monitoring the situation in each of them.
I recall how warmly you welcomed me to India, Mr Prime Minister. I hope to see you in Russia for the G20, as well as any other time that is convenient for you.
Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh
(retranslated): Mr President, it is always an enormous honour and a great pleasure for me to meet with you.
The mechanism of yearly summits between Russia and India gives us a wonderful, unique opportunity to talk and discuss all the current issues on our bilateral and international agenda.
We are also taking the opportunity to meet during other forums and international events. And I would like to express my particular gratitude to you personally, Mr President, for your input into deepening, strengthening and broadening our partnership and cooperation.
During your visit to the Republic of India in December, we had the chance to discuss various aspects of cooperation between Russia and India. I must tell you, Mr President, that I am satisfied and pleased with the progress that has been made since then.
