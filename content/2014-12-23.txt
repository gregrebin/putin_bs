Press statement following the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting. With President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
This year’s final session of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council took place in a business-like and constructive atmosphere.
Together with the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, we discussed pressing issues dealing with the implementation of the Eurasian integration project. As you have seen, we have approved a big package of documents aimed at the further development of our trade and investment ties, strengthening the institutional basis of our integration and improving the functioning of its bodies – the Eurasian Economic Commission and Court.
In just a few days, on January 1, 2015 the new Eurasian Economic Union will become fully functional. Its creation is the result of the joint efforts of the three states’ leadership, the close cooperation of our Governments, the Eurasian Commission, experts and the business community.
Naturally, the political decisions were made by the Presidents. Now, in the presence of all my colleagues I would like to thank them for the joint work – complicated, but very necessary and highly professional.
We have consistently and successfully covered all the stages of integration, having started with the creation of the Customs Union, which was later transformed into the Common Economic Space. We gradually brought closer and synchronised our work in trade and other areas of the economy, while now we are moving on to the highest stage of integration – the unhindered movement of goods, services, capital and labour.
I want to remind you that we are creating a common market operating on the basis of the universal norms and rules of the World Trade Organisation with over 170 million consumers and a joint GDP exceeding $4 trillion [as per purchasing power parity].
I would like to highlight the fact that all the participants in this integration process can feel its benefits. Many of the old customs and administrative barriers have been removed. Business opportunities have grown significantly, as well as opportunities for implementing joint investment projects.
Union member-states will conduct a coordinated policy in a range of key areas, including industry, agriculture, transportation and energy, try to align sanitary, veterinary and technical norms and protect consumers’ rights.
The Agreement on the Eurasian Economic Union envisages the creation by 2016 of a common pharmaceutical market. Today we approved agreements regulating trade rules for medicines and medical equipment on the territories of our countries.
We intend to continue our efforts to create by 2019 a common electric power market, and by 2025 – a common market of oil, gas and petroleum products. In the same year of 2025, a supranational body is to become operational to control the Union’s financial market.
