Press statement following the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting. With President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
This year’s final session of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council took place in a business-like and constructive atmosphere.
Together with the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, we discussed pressing issues dealing with the implementation of the Eurasian integration project. As you have seen, we have approved a big package of documents aimed at the further development of our trade and investment ties, strengthening the institutional basis of our integration and improving the functioning of its bodies – the Eurasian Economic Commission and Court.
In just a few days, on January 1, 2015 the new Eurasian Economic Union will become fully functional. Its creation is the result of the joint efforts of the three states’ leadership, the close cooperation of our Governments, the Eurasian Commission, experts and the business community.
Naturally, the political decisions were made by the Presidents. Now, in the presence of all my colleagues I would like to thank them for the joint work – complicated, but very necessary and highly professional.
We have consistently and successfully covered all the stages of integration, having started with the creation of the Customs Union, which was later transformed into the Common Economic Space. We gradually brought closer and synchronised our work in trade and other areas of the economy, while now we are moving on to the highest stage of integration – the unhindered movement of goods, services, capital and labour.
I want to remind you that we are creating a common market operating on the basis of the universal norms and rules of the World Trade Organisation with over 170 million consumers and a joint GDP exceeding $4 trillion [as per purchasing power parity].
I would like to highlight the fact that all the participants in this integration process can feel its benefits. Many of the old customs and administrative barriers have been removed. Business opportunities have grown significantly, as well as opportunities for implementing joint investment projects.
Union member-states will conduct a coordinated policy in a range of key areas, including industry, agriculture, transportation and energy, try to align sanitary, veterinary and technical norms and protect consumers’ rights.
The Agreement on the Eurasian Economic Union envisages the creation by 2016 of a common pharmaceutical market. Today we approved agreements regulating trade rules for medicines and medical equipment on the territories of our countries.
We intend to continue our efforts to create by 2019 a common electric power market, and by 2025 – a common market of oil, gas and petroleum products. In the same year of 2025, a supranational body is to become operational to control the Union’s financial market.Events
Launch of Angara booster rocket
Vladimir Putin took part via linkup in the first trial launch of an Angara A5 heavy-class carrier rocket from the Plesetsk Space Launch Centre.

The Kremlin, Moscow
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Commander of Space Defence Forces Alexander Golovko reported the launch of the carrier rocket to the President. Also taking part in the videoconference was Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Ivanov.
Angara is a new generation carrier rocket based on the universal oxygen-kerosene propelled rocket module. The Angara A5 carrier rocket with the Briz-M upper stage will boost a 2 tonne mock-up workload to a geostationary orbit.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu, Mr Golovko, Mr Ivanov, friends and colleagues,
Congratulations on the successful launch. As planned, today we had the first trial launch of the Angara A5 heavy carrier rocket.
This is a major achievement for our space rocket industry and for Russia in general. I would like to remind you that on July 9 we successfully launched a lightweight Angara carrier rocket. Thus, we are consistently implementing a large-scale state programme – something my colleagues have just spoken of – a programme that actually starts a new stage in space exploration.
As it has already been mentioned, the most advanced technologies have been used in the heavyweight Angara-A5 carrier rocket. It can be used to deliver existing and future space equipment of military, economic and research application to any orbit. Thus, as Mr Shoigu has said, they are designed for use in rocket attack early warning systems, in reconnaissance, navigation and communication, including relay-type communication. This will significantly boost Russia’s security.
I would like to highlight that all the component parts of the Angara are made in Russia. It has been developed with the use of advanced technologies that fully meet modern standards, including environmental requirements. This significantly reduces its impact on the environment.
In future, these rockets will replace their predecessors Proton-M and Rokot and will be launched from the Plesetsk Space Launch Centre.
I would like to thank everyone involved in today’s launch: engineers, designers, test engineers and servicemen. You have tackled this challenge with a great sense of responsibility and your success has demonstrated that Russia remains one of the world’s accepted leaders in space exploration.
As you all know, there is still a lot of work ahead. In the next five years starting in 2015 you will conduct a series of launches of various class carrier rockets. The trials are to be completed by 2020. I am certain that this work will be carried out with the same responsibility you demonstrated at this stage and we will reach new heights in space exploration.
Thank you all. Congratulations and best wishes for the coming New Year.

Meeting with President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.
Earlier in the day, the two presidents took part in the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting.
During a separate bilateral meeting, Vladimir Putin congratulated Almazbek Atambayev
on Kyrgyzstan’s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, let me once again congratulate you on Kyrgyzstan’s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union.
I must note that your entire team worked very efficiently, quickly and professionally. This was probably the driver for creating the conditions that allowed us to make the decision we made today – on Kyrgyzstan's joining the Eurasian Economic Union.
I am sure that no matter how complicated the situation in the global economy and in our economies might be, it is always easier to deal with difficulties together, by joining our efforts than do it on your own. So, let me once again thank you for the joint work we did at this stage and congratulate you on today's event.

Address at the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
We are holding the final session of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council this year.
We have made good large-scale achievements in deepening our integration. We have managed to complete in a short time the drafting of the Agreement to set up the Eurasian Economic Union. We signed it at the Astana summit in May, and by our October meeting in Minsk the Agreement was ratified by the parliaments of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan and will come into effect as of January 1, 2015.
Thus, the Eurasian Economic Union will become fully functional. As we have noted on numerous occasions, we will create a common market with over 170 million consumers and provide for the free movement of goods, services, capital and workforce. Business will be able to operate using transparent universal international trade regulations based on the principles of the World Trade Organisation.

Statement for the press following the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting
December 23, 2014
Mutual benefit from participation in the integration project is obvious. The successful activity of the Customs Union, which we created in 2011, demonstrates it. Economic ties between the three states have grown in both quality and quantity. Trade has gone up by 50 percent. As for quality, the structure of mutual trade has improved due to an increased share of goods with high added value.
The launch of the Eurasian Union means transition to a more advanced level of integration. I am confident that this will give an impetus to the development of our countries’ economies. The Union will become a powerful growth centre for the entire region, trade and investment flow will grow, business ties will become stronger and the welfare of our citizens will improve.
The integration project we are implementing is unique not only in scale and in content, but also in spirit. It is based on principles of equality, trust, mutual respect and consideration for each other’s interests. At the same time, its participants retain their state sovereignty and national identity.
We are working to find mutually acceptable solutions and compromises on a variety of issues. In our decision-making, we are guided by the principle of consensus. Our countries have equal representation at the governing bodies and the Union Court.
All this makes Eurasian integration attractive for our neighbours and partners in the CIS. Two months ago in Minsk, we signed an Agreement for Armenia to join the Union. It has been ratified, and Armenia will become a full-fledged member of our Union as of January 2, 2015.
Today we will sign an agreement with Kyrgyzstan on joining the Eurasian Union. Our Kyrgyzstani friends, together with the Governments of the three states and the Eurasian Commission will make every effort to adapt national legislation to the requirements of the Customs Union and Common Economic Space. The majority of the corresponding roadmaps have been cleared. It is important to maintain the pace of our work and complete it together.
There is growing interest in cooperating with the Eurasian Union among countries in other regions. Thus, the drafting of a free trade agreement with Vietnam has entered its final stage.
We are working on similar agreements with Turkey, India and Israel. Only recently, as I have just told my colleagues here, during my trip to Uzbekistan we agreed with the Uzbekistani President to set up a working group to draft a free trade zone agreement between our Union and Uzbekistan.
Memorandums of understanding are being drafted with ASEAN and Mercosur states. I am certain that expanding ties with all countries and organisations both in the East and in the West on the basis of equality and mutual benefit meets the interests of our Union as well.
To sum up, I would like to stress that our integration is developing successfully and we can see tangible results. However, we should not be complacent. There are great new challenges ahead of us. We are to ensure the stable and efficient functioning of the Eurasian Union and continue strengthening its institutional basis. We will make a number of decisions in this area today, including an agreement on the Presidency procedure.
Among our priorities I see the need to make the Union more competitive and attractive for investors, to launch joint projects and create high-technology jobs in the oil and gas sector, in the metals and chemical industries, aviation, machine-building and the space industry.
We must remove the existing barriers that impede the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour. We are to implement plans to form as of 2016 a common market of pharmaceutical and medical products. Our decision regarding the turnover of medicines and medical goods will be a step in this direction.
We will also approve a list of services sectors where the common market will become functional on January 1, 2015. This will benefit construction workers, wholesale and retail traders and companies working in tourism. It is important that we do not drag our feet with the mutual approval of licences for these activities issued by our respective countries. This will make it possible for our companies to take full advantage of the benefits of integration right from the start.
I expect our meeting to be business-like and constructive, as always.
Thank you for your attention.

Address at the CSTO Collective Security Council restricted format meeting

Meeting of the CSTO Collective Security Council in narrow format.

CSTO Summit
December 23, 2014
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Moscow, to another CSTO
Collective Security Council meeting.
Our summit is taking place in complicated times. The situation in the world is changing dynamically. Old issues are escalated, new ones appear and unfortunately, the global security system is being deformed.
All this requires concerted collective measures from the CSTO states to ensure the security of our countries and the region as a whole, to counteract terrorism, drag trafficking, trans-boundary organised crime and to prevent natural disasters and industrial accidents.
The CSTO has the capability to resolve all these issues. In the many years of its existence, the organisation has proven itself a respected and efficient regional structure. It has amassed extensive experience in equal partnerships based on openness, mutual respect and trust.
During its Presidency in the CSTO, Russia paid special attention to strengthening the organisation’s external borders and perfecting the collective deployment forces and means.
Efforts of the member-states were aimed at improving operative and combat training for CSTO members’ armies and special units and at practicing interaction in peacekeeping operations.
In May, the military and political leaders of the organisation’s member-states visited the National Defence Centre in Moscow to see the latest Russian armed forces’ management system. In July, Rubezh-2014 command and headquarters exercises of the Collective Rapid Response Forces were held in Russia. In August, Interaction-2014 Collective Rapid Response Force exercises were held in Kazakhstan. Kyrgyzstan hosted Nerushimoye Bratstvo-2014 CSTO Peacekeeping Forces exercises.
We have started the creation of joint emergency response mechanisms. With Russia’s active support a network of CSTO humanitarian centres is being set up. The first one is to open next year in Armenia; another one will then become operable in Kyrgyzstan.
Coordination between CSTO member-states in major international organisations has improved. On our joint initiative, the UN and the OSCE have passed a number of documents dealing with the situation in Syria, the creation of a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia and countering attempts to falsify history.
I would like to specially mention the adoption by a General Assembly majority vote of the Resolution to combat the glorification of Nazi ideology. This was our joint initiative; we presented this document with our Belarusian colleagues as our joint position. The only countries voting against it were the United States, Canada and Ukraine. This resolution, in our view, is especially timely ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War – an event we will be celebrating together in May 2015.
It is important to apply this practice of joint action in other areas of our work as well. I am primarily referring here to combatting extremism and terrorism.
The CSTO should continue focusing its attention on enhancing its close cooperation with Afghanistan, especially in view of the greater risk to regional security posed by the withdrawal of International Forces.
We are all interested in a flourishing, happy and neutral Afghanistan. We proceed from the notion that the Afghan leadership will work to stabilise the situation in the country.
At the same time, the current situation causes concern. Militant groups of the Islamic State are attempting to include certain Afghan provinces in the so-called Islamic Caliphate. Terrorist and extremist groups are already spreading their activity to Central Asia.
In these circumstances, the CSTO states should be ready to take adequate preventive measures. In particular, we need to continue focusing on the Tajik-Afghan border and on providing Tajikistan with financial and material aid to modernise its armed forces.
We must continue our cooperation with the Afghan authorities in combatting drug trafficking. In the past few years over 1,000 representatives of Afghan law enforcement agencies were trained in Russia. The Operation Kanal is held annually to prevent drug trafficking, and this year alone it resulted in the confiscation of over 17 tonnes of drugs.
Colleagues,
Today Tajikistan takes over CSTO Presidency from Russia. I would like to wish our Tajikistani friends success in this work. I would like to stress that you can count on our help and support. We, in turn, count on continuity in the Organisations’ activities, on close cooperation in meeting the targets set in the joint Statement of the Heads of Collective Security Treaty Organisation Member-States, to be signed following today’s meeting.
I am convinced that given concerted action based on a common consolidated stand we can continue contributing to stronger regional security and a stable development for the peace and prosperity of our nations.

Opening address at the CSTO Collective Security Council plenary session
December 23, 2014
14:10
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, let me once again welcome you here in the Kremlin, now in a more expanded format.
My colleagues and I have already started our work and held a private exchange.
Before I give the floor to the new CSTO Chairman, President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon, I would like to inform you of a very important and positive event for Russia, and consequently, for all CSTO members-states. During the past 10 years, we have been working on the development and launch of the Angara A5 heavy-class carrier rocket, and today we had its first successful test launch. The rocket is designed to take loads of up to 24.5 tonnes to low circular orbits, up to 7 tonnes to elliptic orbits, and up to 3.4 tonnes to geostationary orbits. This very important part of the programme has been completed. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the rocket will not only be used for the benefit of the economy, but for strengthening Russia’s defence capability as well, which means defence capability of all the CSTO member-states. I am referring here to missile attack warning, reconnaissance, navigation communication and signal relay. This is one thing.

The other is that all of us here have recently visited the Russian Defence Ministry to take part in the exercises we organised. I would like to inform you that Russia has opened a new National Defence Management Centre of the Russian Federation. Everything has been done using solely Russian technologies, with powerful computer support unrivalled in the world so far, and today the Secretary of our organisation has mentioned that all CSTO states will be involved in this defence management centre. I am confident that this will enhance governance of national defence systems and troops and will improve our coordination.
Thank you for your attention.
