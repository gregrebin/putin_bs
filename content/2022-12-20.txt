President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
Welcome to the ceremony for presenting state decorations.
Today, we will be honouring outstanding Russians: heroes, trail blazers, creators, people of courage and action who have made a tremendous contribution to developing the country and proven their worth at this challenging and crucial juncture.
Our country has had to deal with challenges and stand up for its sovereignty many times. Today, Russia faces the same challenges. On the frontlines of the special military operation, soldiers, officers, militia members and volunteers have been demonstrating exceptional courage and self-sacrifice.
Military personnel who performed their combat missions with exceptional valour will receive the Hero of Russia title, which is the highest decoration of our Motherland. We are proud of each one of you and admire the resilience and courage of those who stood up to defend their homeland in the hour of need and performed their military duty in the combat zone, helping bring life back to normal on our new territories.
Love for the Motherland, for one's fellow countrymen and fellow citizens is a powerful driving force that inspires us to achievements and victories. And this sense of devotion to our country and people comes, of course, first and foremost, from the family – from the values and moral compass that we learn from birth from our dearest and closest people.
Today’s audience includes beautiful women, for whom motherhood has become a real calling. In their large families they bring up beautiful children and undoubtedly deserve the honorary title Mother Heroine.
It is very important to support and protect family ties. People of our traditional religions, including the Russian Orthodox Church, devote themselves to the revival of our spiritual, culture and ancestral traditions, and to social service. Metropolitan Yuvenaly devoted himself wholeheartedly to this path.
Here we have teachers, doctors, factory workers and other people who have devoted themselves to various professions. All of you add to the glory and wealth of Russia.
Viktor Rashnikov dedicated more than half a century to the legendary Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works. He did a lot for the development of this native plant and the whole metallurgical industry. The title Hero of Labour rightfully marks his merits.
Radiy Ilkayev, an outstanding physicist, enjoys unquestioned authority in the academic community. His research and fruitful organisational and educational work has served to create a reliable nuclear shield and unlock Russia’s rich scientific and technological potential.
The crew of the Christophe de Margerie LNG tanker and its captain Sergei Gen are helping with the important national goal of strengthening the position of our country in the Arctic and expanding sea transport corridors.
Olga Tambovtseva has worked in the agribusiness sector for decades. She is successfully engaged in one of the most complex and demanded areas – livestock breeding.
Friends,
All of your achievements are inspiring examples for society, for our citizens, above all, for young people. With your deeds and actions, you are literally writing the country’s history and creating a foundation for future breakthroughs and achievements.
I thank you and warmly congratulate you on receiving these high state decorations and honorary titles.
Thank you for your attention.

Vladimir Putin: Friends,
Today, as it has been already noted, we are really living in difficult and unusual times. We keep saying all the time that we are in unusual times, that we are not on a continuous holiday. At all times, a country and every person, if he or she is developing and moving forward, have to overcome certain difficulties on this road. Otherwise, there is no forward or upward progress. That said, today the difficulties are particularly pronounced. There is no doubt that our military, our warriors in the special military operation zone are faced with the most complicated, demanding and dangerous tasks.
I said, and this was recalled today, that I sincerely consider all of them heroes – all those who are carrying out this difficult, demanding and dangerous service. They put themselves in danger every second. I believe the overwhelming majority of our people are thinking about this. I am thinking about it all the time. We certainly wish them success.
Of course, we cannot congratulate everyone today. What is taking place here now is symbolic. Not everyone who received decorations is with us. Many have not yet received decorations but deserve them. Those who left us, leaders such as Alexander Zakharchenko – the first head of the Donetsk Republic, are not here. We will never forget about them. There were civilians who did not spare themselves while helping other people, including soldiers. They were involved in resolving the most important and difficult tasks.
There are people from different generations, different fields and different vocations in this hall today. They are mothers who are bringing up many children and who get us on our feet. They are teachers and scientists who are creating a basis for development. They are instructors and people of art who are shaping our mentality throughout our lives. And all of them are Russia! They are the power and reliability of our country. The better all our people are working – those who set the pace for forward movement – the stronger this power becomes. These people are you.
I congratulate you on your well-deserved decorations of the Motherland and wish you all the best.

Meeting with Acting Head of Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Acting Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin.

Acting Head of Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Pushilin, I have just spoken to your colleague from the Lugansk People’s Republic [Leonid Pasechnik]. We know that the security situation in Donetsk is equally or perhaps even more critical, considering the frequent shelling of residential areas in Donetsk by the Ukrainian army. It is a separate topic that we will certainly discuss.
But, as with Mr Pasechnik, I suggest we start with the issues that concern each resident of the Donetsk People’s Republic – that is, housing, water and heating supply, and healthcare. Let us cover these vital topics first and then, of course, talk about security.
Please, go ahead.
Acting Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin
: Mr President,
Actually, the situation is developing in different ways. Indeed, the restoration of housing and the issues concerning every person such as water supply are of great importance to us.
We have put in great effort, in cooperation with the competent agencies and ministries of the Russian Federation. Several water pipelines have been built to supply water from reserve reservoirs. However, we have been able to cover the demand only in part. In the major cities of Donetsk, Makeyevka and Horlivka, water is available for two hours once every three days.
Thank you very much for supporting the decision to build a new pipeline connected to the Don River. Considering all the factors, it is extremely important. Again, considering that the network repair programme has been approved and considering the enormous water losses, which are just horrifying in percentage terms, we need both the water pipeline and maintenance.
Heating has been affected as a result. Preparation for the heating season was the most difficult period due to water shortages. Of course, we have taken additional measures, in cooperation with supervising regions.
Moscow is helping Donetsk with drilling wells and delivering water in tank cars on a daily basis because the problem of water loss persists. The system may be filled up and the boiler station may operate but water leaks cause the system to shut down automatically and water does not reach consumers.
Therefore, this matter is not resolved everywhere yet. But, even despite the shelling and loss of power at boiler stations, we still try to make sure that all people have warm homes. We have not been able to provide heating everywhere though because of the boiler station shutdowns.
Mariupol is a special case. The heating situation there is slightly more challenging but also slightly easier. The city is no longer being shelled but the scope of destruction is extensive. We have tried to cover the demand by using modular boilers. Overall, the problem may not be fully resolved but we are dealing with it as best as we can.
There are temporary accommodation facilities where we place people, so they do not have to stay in the destroyed housing without heating.
The region has been stabilised – again, mostly due to the patronage of Russian regions. In total, there are 17 such regions, but the greatest assistance has been provided by St Petersburg, the Moscow Region, and the Tula Region, and I would like to thank them sincerely.
I will tell you that the new facilities built by now – we have never seen anything like this, these new schools and kindergartens. This really gives great hope for the future that we can see. As soon as the special military operation is over, we will be able to fully stabilise the situation, and we are indeed very optimistic in this regard.
As for the next concern that people have, naturally, it is about the checkpoints. I have a request for you, and it actually includes several parts. As regards the personnel, and the increase, we discussed this with Mr Bortnikov who said that there are reserves. The problem is that this requires the Government's instruction to comprehensively work on this and expand it.
Here is the problem. Since the Crimean Bridge has been repaired, we have additional flows from the Rostov Region, of course, a lot of repair work is underway, plus our people who want to get all the public services that are not yet fully available to them at home.
There is something else: we need to speed up the opening of integrated government service centres. With more local centres, people will not have to go to Rostov to register their cars, or to get other services. This system is well developed in Rostov, but here, the process is ongoing, so there will be a request in this regard.
And taking into account these steps, with an increase in checkpoints, we can stabilise the situation here, in fact, from Rostov, taking into account the road repairs…
Vladimir Putin: Are you talking about the checkpoints on the border between the Rostov Region and the Donetsk Republic?
Denis Pushilin: On the administrative border, yes. We have three checkpoints that we would like…
Vladimir Putin: All right, we will do this.
Denis Pushilin: With the roads, it will take no more than seven hours to get from the Rostov Region to Crimea via the Donetsk People's Republic.
Vladimir Putin: The part of the road there that goes to Crimea has been repaired.
Denis Pushilin: Yes, a lot of roads have been repaired, that is, more than 400 kilometres. We have never seen roadwork on this scale – all cutting-edge and up to Russian standards. Indeed, where we see the standards of the Russian Federation applied, whether it is roads, or schools, or kindergartens, it evokes sincere wonder and admiration in us. Over the past eight years – and we had lagged behind even before that – we have fallen behind, but we will catch up.
Vladimir Putin: I have no doubt that this will be the case, given the people who work there.
Denis Pushilin: The next question I wanted to raise with you and submit for your consideration is that we lack utility workers. There are several reasons for that. Apart from the mobilisation, there is also the fact that the relevant colleges and schools did not receive the attention they needed. Our utilities are understaffed by up to 70 percent, while those who are still working are true heroes. You may have noticed that whenever there is an incoming strike, they arrive at the scene immediately.
Here is what I wanted to ask you. I think it would be fair to offer them a mark-up on their salaries in the areas that are now literally on the frontline, including in some of the regions in Donetsk.
Vladimir Putin: Have you put these ideas on paper?
Denis Pushilin: I have.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Denis Pushilin: People will definitely support this.
I would also like to thank you for the perinatal centre, which is now under construction in the Kirovsky District of Donetsk. The construction workers are at work.
Vladimir Putin: How many beds will it have?
Denis Pushilin: 130 beds. This new, state-of-the-art centre will help us a lot, especially considering the destruction we now have. The workers have been doing a fine job. They are heroes who find themselves in harm’s way all the time. Construction carries on regardless, and this new perinatal centre is expected to be completed by the end of next year.
Turning back to Mariupol, a lot of housing has been built – brand new neighbourhoods, including the Nevsky neighbourhood built by the Defence Ministry’s military construction company. The Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation also did its job by building four apartment blocks, and it will complete six more by the end of the year. This will be new, modern and comfortable housing.
Looking at Mariupol, where there is no firing anymore, we know that we will rebuild the republic. Thank you for your support and for paying attention to all the details.
Our people will not forgive me if I fail to express our special gratitude for ensuring that students do not get drafted into the army during mobilisation. There was a lot of concern about that. This was a big sigh of relief for us, because we were forced to mobilise people into the army. There was no other way.
Vladimir Putin: I see.
Denis Pushilin: Students must be able to study. They are our future, our children.
Vladimir Putin: But many of them refused to leave the army and stayed in the Armed Forces as volunteers.
Denis Pushilin: When someone wants to serve, that is a different story…
Vladimir Putin: Of course.
Denis Pushilin: Thank you for this decision.
Frankly, I am most grateful to you for the Saur-Mogila, our place of power, our symbol. It was not simply renovated but essentially restored, revived, in view of the current circumstances.
Vladimir Putin: The result is beautiful.
Denis Pushilin: Very beautiful. I hope that later – not right now, of course – but later we will have an opportunity and you will see what I mean with your own eyes.
Vladimir Putin: All right. What about healthcare?
Denis Pushilin: As concerns healthcare, I can tell you that the situation with Covid-19 is under control. The seasonal flu outbreak is slightly worse but our medical workers are doing what they can. We can see that Kalinin Hospital, the largest hospital in Donetsk, has been almost completely destroyed after two days of shelling by those scoundrels.
However, even in view of all the factors, I believe there are no serious problems in healthcare. At the federal level, there is close cooperation with the Russian Healthcare Ministry. All issues are resolved promptly. The difficulties we had in the past in a number of areas are now essentially resolved, so I do not see any extra issues that cannot be handled in the normal course of business.
Vladimir Putin: I have already spoken with the healthcare minister. If necessary, we can arrange to transfer all the patients who require special treatment, to federal medical facilities.
Denis Pushilin: Thank you very much. We will try to manage everything we can. Our medical workers are excellent professionals. Our local medical university trains highly qualified doctors. Considering the difference in wages that was particularly noticeable before, many doctors have left though, as they were highly sought after in other regions of Russia.
Vladimir Putin: But they still need support with professional development. They must be included in the Healthcare Ministry’s professional development system.
Denis Pushilin: Absolutely. On our part, we do our best but there is also a response from the federal government and the regions also get involved.
Vladimir Putin: The resources of the healthcare system must be improved, along with building new facilities, maintaining existing clinics and upgrading them with modern equipment.
Denis Pushilin: The medical multi-purpose centre in Mariupol, built by a military construction company, by the way, was built in 84 days as on a turn-key basis, fully equipped with everything from the building itself and modern medical equipment to kitchen utensils. It was ready to operate.
Of course, for us a project like this is still far amazing because our healthcare facilities are seriously lagging behind when it comes to resources and technology. Many of these facilities have not been renovated since the Soviet times.
Vladimir Putin: Of course. We know this from Crimea.
With regard to shelling, as far as I understand, the Ukrainian forces are targeting residential areas of Donetsk.
Denis Pushilin: Yes, what we see is targeted firing of shells into large areas in Donetsk, Makeyevka, and Horlivka. In Donetsk alone, 21 people died and 94 were wounded, and 460 buildings were damaged from December 2 to December18.
Vladimir Putin: Are these people civilians?
Denis Pushilin: Yes, civilians all of them. This, of course, has prompted a very serious response on our part, and the Russian Armed Forces are doing their best.
In this regard, I would like to ask you to increase the supply of the latest air defence systems. This and a strengthening the counter-battery efforts would help us to put an end to the shelling of our large urban areas and to push the enemy back. Whenever they have a chance, they use it. They stop at nothing.
Vladimir Putin: Let me bring it to everyone’s attention that not a single foreign media outlet or human rights organisation has uttered a word about these developments.
Denis Pushilin: Alas, this is true, and we have to live with that. Double standards prevailed throughout the negotiating process in 2014.
Vladimir Putin: That is the way it was, indeed.
Denis Pushilin: It is as if we do not exist and the developments are unfolding in a completely different way.
Let us face it: Donbass was for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and, without a doubt, Russia, as a guarantor country, was too and did everything possible and then some.
We had apprehensions seeing how the talks unfolded, but, unfortunately, Europe, and the West in general, has made it blatantly clear that we cannot trust them, because quite recently the former Federal Chancellor of Germany… I can imagine your emotions, because even for us, who did not really trust them, it was a shock.
Vladimir Putin: They said they never planned to act on anything and that they signed the document only to buy some time to obtain weapons and to carry out, in fact, military operations.
All right, we will talk about this in more detail right now.

Meeting with Acting Head of Lugansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Acting Head of the Lugansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik.
December 20, 2022

The Kremlin, Moscow

With Acting Head of Lugansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Pasechnik, it is no secret that the situation in the Lugansk People’s Republic remains very complicated, with the key issue being keeping people safe.
Still, I suggest we begin with other issues today, namely, economic ones, with the economy, social sphere and healthcare.
I would like you to give me a retrospective on what has been going on in these crucial areas, and we will certainly discuss all other issues afterward.
Go ahead, please.
Acting Head of the Lugansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik
: Thank you, Mr President.
The foundation of our economy is obviously the coal industry. The Republic is home to the only fuel and coal enterprise, Vostokugol Republican Fuel Company.
This coal company was basically moving towards growth before the launch of the special military operation. In 2019 we reorganised the coal industry and shut down all coal mines operating at a loss.
Around 32,000 people were made redundant at the closed mines. However, 29,000 virtually on the same day went to work in other mines, which means they actually did not feel the layoffs. We offered early retirement to some of the personnel, some other workers were sent to different jobs, so there remained just 500 people that we were unable to provide jobs to.
In 2020–2021 we were steadily increasing coal production and the profitability of the enterprise. However, in 2022, due to the start of the special military operation, 58 percent of miners – the ones that were working in the mines, young guys – went to the front. By way of example, only three people are now working in one of the mines where there should be over 300 miners.
The enterprise has become unprofitable. We are unable to reach the level where it would be profitable. In fact, there is not enough money to pay wages. This is the biggest problem.
We asked for help from the special commission and spoke to Mr Khusnullin. Funding has been allocated to us – about 1 billion rubles – to pay the wage arrears. But the thing is that this situation cannot be tolerated. Therefore, I raised the question of how this problem can be settled.
As for what has been done, it was suggested to me that we privatise the enterprises, which looks like the simplest solution. Yes, we would no longer need to deal with this problem. We would be asked no questions. We would not request subsidies for paying wages. But I have two questions.
The first question has to do with the economy. It turns out that as long as the mines are state-owned they are unprofitable, but if they are privately owned, they quickly become profitable, start earning good money and paying good wages to professionals. The question is, are we doing something wrong? We must answer this question.
Vladimir Putin: Who is the current owner? The republic?
Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, the republic. It is a state unitary enterprise.
This is what we propose. There is also an illegal mining company operating in the republic.
Vladimir Putin: An unregistered company?
Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, exactly.
A company buys part of an officially registered coal producer and uses it to legalise the operation of its illegal facilities. Consequently, they are highly profitable because they do not pay full taxes, they do not work in accordance with the established rules and, of course, at some stage they become a serious rival of our state-owned enterprise.
For example, according to my information, a huge volume of coal has been delivered to Rostov from our small coal companies, the so-called coyote hole mines. I do not know how this coal is legalised, but it is, and after that it is sold to Ukraine, Europe and other places. In other words, a private company can export its coal whereas we cannot.
My first proposal is that our law enforcement agencies redouble their effort in this area so that the operation of these coyote hole mines is cut short and prohibited. I believe that this will increase the profitability of our enterprises. This is my first point.
The second, if we cut short and prohibit these coyote hole mines, their personnel will be released, and we will be able to offer them jobs at our enterprises. In other words, we will increase the number of coal producing personnel and also the profitability of the state-owned company.
To encourage people to work there, we must make coal mining a reserved occupation, so that miners will not be called up, at least for now, to the units of the Lugansk People’s Republic or the Armed Forces of Russia. I believe that this will help us improve the situation.
There is also a political aspect, which I regard as very important. We have become part of the Russian Federation, and it will look wrong if we shut down enterprises in this situation. In other words, our enterprises worked when we were an independent republic, but they will be shut down or turned over to private owners now.
Therefore, we would like to ask you to support us, to provide the necessary subsidies for paying wages and for development, at least for some time, possibly six months or a year, until the end of 2023, so that we can take the measures I have described to save face. Since there is also an economic aspect to this, I believe that we will be able to improve the situation and even make some enterprises profitable.
There is one more thing which I failed to mention. It is a request to add us to state coal supply programmes. Maybe some regions need our coal, the coal of Donbass. I understand that we will be competing, in a way, with Kuzbass, but maybe someone will want to buy our coal for logistical or quality reasons, because the quality of our coal is very high. Mr President, this is why we are asking you to support us.
Perhaps it would be easier to cede the enterprise to a private owner, but I would rather see Vostokugol retain its public status, so that we can continue working.
There is another aspect I have not mentioned. In any event, the miners who are currently fighting will come back and they will say to me, “Mr Pasechnik, we spilled our blood, but we have nowhere to work.” We will have to provide them with jobs, to decide their destinies because they are our people, and we must take care of them.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Pasechnik, there are almost no state-owned coal enterprises left in Russia. This does not necessarily mean that there can be no state-owned enterprises in the Lugansk People’s Republic.
However, their privatisation does not mean that they will be shut down. You said that the people will come back and there will be no employment for them. To be honest, people who work at enterprises care nothing about who owns their company. They want to get paid on time, and they want decent wages that reflect labour intensity levels, the risks involved, and so on.
I repeat, no federal agency will impose any decisions linked with privatisation or any other property-related decisions on you. You must do what you think is necessary. The republic is the owner, and you should make the decision.
Regarding assistance needed today, of course, we will provide it. First of all, this concerns wage subsidies and funding for implementing other measures needed to keep the enterprises going. We will also do this as soon as possible. We need to have an understanding of the specific volumes required. This is the second point.
Thirdly, we need to analyse the current economic status of these enterprises.
You mentioned small unregistered coal enterprises that you call coyote hole mines. Shutting them down seems to be the easiest option. You can do this if the authorities insist. We will provide the required support. However, this will create the problems you mentioned. People will be unable to find jobs. We need to assess the wage levels they have.
You see, it is now possible to analyse everything from scratch, from centre-field, as football players say, and to make well-thought-out decisions that would be coordinated with the people. Here is another question: will you shut these enterprises tomorrow? You also say that people will go to work for your public enterprise; and what if they do not?
This also concerns wage levels: they earn money, and, as you said, the produce are delivered to Rostov and to other Russian regions. We should see why this cannot be done with state-owned enterprises as well. You are absolutely right. All we have to do is meticulously analyse the situation and make decisions on that basis.
Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, we discussed this. There was a meeting attended by Prime Minister of the Lugansk People's Republic Sergei Kozlov.
Vladimir Putin: Well, now that you told me about it and informed me, I will definitely talk to my colleagues and ask them to come back, look at it again and then report on what they propose and why.
The main criterion, of course, is always the interests of the people, the employees, the interests of those who work at these enterprises. We have to provide them with jobs and the appropriate level of wages, which must be paid regularly, without any disruptions. This is what is important.
By and large, to be honest, the form of ownership does not even matter. It is important that the state simply keep track of the rules that are laid down for all the people who work in this field. Whether one is the owner or a manager, or an ordinary worker – everyone has to comply with certain rules, prescribed by the state, eventually in the interest of those who work at these enterprises.
Do you have any documents on this subject with you?
Leonid Pasechnik: I have the documents with me, Mr President. They state in general terms what we ask you to consider and do. But maybe we could take another look, ask the Government to review this.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, let us do that now.
Leonid Pasechnik: I think this will probably be the right decision. We may be wrong.
Vladimir Putin: No, look, I would like to say it again: no one will impose these decisions on you. If you need a subsidy for some time to support these companies, we will do it. This is not the money Russia will stand for. No, this is not an issue at all. The question is economic efficiency.
Of course, we must analyse this matter. You are right when you said we must analyse what prevents state-owned enterprises from being efficient. Let us have a look at it. Maybe one could take these decisions and then retain them in the republic’s ownership. It can be done that way too. We will see.
Anything else?
Leonid Pasechnik: My second question is about medicine. At present, our healthcare system is working quite steadily and everything is great.
Vladimir Putin: I doubt it is that great. You have had such a difficult eight years, and yet everything is great?
Leonid Pasechnik: You know, these eight years were fairly challenging. In 2019, when I toured the hospitals, I visited a veterans' hospital. Truth be told, I was unpleasantly surprised. Nothing high-end there in terms of renovation, but the premises were up to standard. The equipment and the medications, though, left much to be desired …
Vladimir Putin: Obsolete.
Leonid Pasechnik: Frankly, it was from the 1980s. So, when we started receiving high-quality medical equipment in fairly large quantities in the last couple of years, and the quality of medical help improved drastically, everyone, including the minister, appreciated it.
Vladimir Putin: The situation was changing.
Leonid Pasechnik: Frankly, we had never seen such equipment. One could only dream of having it. So, everything is working fine now, but there are issues.
We have arrangements with the Russian regions concerning the evacuation of civilians from the Lugansk People's Republic and providing them with help as planned. We are working on transport arrangements, and the regions are helping us a lot, but we are very concerned that this help may still not be enough for us.
Vladimir Putin: No, no. The Ministry of Healthcare was instructed accordingly, and I will have a word with the Minister and Ms Golikova. Planned help to the people of the republic should be provided exactly as scheduled, without failure. Should any issues arise, they must be addressed and resolved. We will definitely work on this.
Leonid Pasechnik: I drafted a letter on this matter.
Vladimir Putin: Fine, let me have it.
Leonid Pasechnik: There is a heating problem there. We would like to have some subsidies to bring in firewood and coal at our expense, because we do not have enough of it to stoke a fire in wood-burning stoves.
Vladimir Putin: We can do it easily. What is the second issue?
Leonid Pasechnik: It concerns communications, the same thing here. We will not be able to do it on time for purely technical reasons. We do not have enough specialists to install wireless communications, the internet, and so on. We just do not have time to build these towers. According to our standards, 10 towers are enough to provide high-quality wireless communications in a given area.
Vladimir Putin: I see.
Leonid Pasechnik: It works well in central districts, but we are short-staffed and are unable to cover all areas.
Vladimir Putin: What needs to be done?
Leonid Pasechnik: We need workers and specialists to go there and help us do that.
Vladimir Putin: Fine.
Leonid Pasechnik: We will send them to safe areas, so that they start working from there…
Vladimir Putin: To create a communication system, so to say.
Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, to create a communication system. Absolutely correct.
Vladimir Putin: Good.

Video address on Security Agency Worker’s Day
December 20, 2022
00:00
Video address on Security Agency Worker’s Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, veterans,
I would like to heartily congratulate you on Security Agency Worker’s Day.
This professional holiday unites people who have chosen hard and demanding service. Those who, sparing no effort and sometimes their life, safeguard our state, society and citizens from external and domestic threats, protect the foundations of the constitutional order and the territorial integrity of our country, and relentlessly combat terrorism, crime and corruption. Throughout the entire history of our Fatherland, security agencies have been a reliable pillar of the state. We are rightfully proud of the deeds of their legendary officers who selflessly served the Motherland and resolutely resisted those who wanted to make our country dependent, weak and divided.
On this day, I want to warmly thank the security services veterans. Your professionalism, resilience and dedication will always set an example for those who are now safeguarding the security and national interests of Russia.
In the past years, our security services have worked very efficiently. I want to thank the employees of the Federal Security Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Guard Service, and the Chief Directorate for Special Programmes for their competence and courage, for being able to promptly deal with the most complex tasks without relying on immediate circumstances.
Today’s rapidly changing global situation and the emergence of new threats and challenges impose high demands on the entire system of Russia’s security agencies. This means that you need to significantly improve your work in key areas, and use your operational, technical and personnel potential to the fullest.
I would like to call attention to the security agency units that have begun their work in Russia’s new regions. Yes, you are faced with difficult tasks now: the situation in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, and the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions is extremely complicated.
But the people who live there, Russian citizens are counting on you and your protection. And your duty is to do everything in your power to ensure their safety and respect for their rights and freedoms. On our part, we will continue to supply the new units with modern equipment and weapons, as well as experienced personnel.
Fighting terrorism remains one of the key priorities for all security services, first of all, the Federal Security Service. You have vast experience in countering terrorism; therefore, it is necessary to continue the efforts to prevent terrorist attacks in a system-wide and consistent way.
Crowded places, strategic facilities, as well as transport and energy infrastructure must be under special control. This task falls on the Federal Security Service under the coordination of the National Anti-Terrorism Committee in close interaction with other security agencies.
The counterintelligence agencies, including the military ones, need to show utmost readiness and concentration. It is necessary to put a firm stop to the activities of foreign special services, and to promptly identify traitors, spies and diversionists.
The FSB Border Guard Service must step up its work. The state border is the most important, key boundary for ensuring the country’s security, and it must be guarded safely. Attempts to break it must be prevented promptly and efficiently using the existing capacities and tools, including mobile and special task units.
You must stay focused in such an important area as countering extremism. Belligerent nationalism calls for violence and provocations aimed at stirring up ethnic hatred are a direct threat to our society’s internal unity. Special services must respond to such attempts promptly.
It is necessary to act more decisively in such important areas as the protection of information resources, combatting economic crimes and corruption.
Comrade officers,
State security, the stability of society, and the reliable provision of the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens are the most important results of your work. I am sure that you know it well and will continue to perform your tasks efficiently, and honestly and properly serve the Motherland and our people.
I again congratulate all of you on the holiday and, of course, the upcoming New Year 2023. I wish you and your families good health and success in the new year.
