President of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan : Welcome, my dear friend Vladimir Putin, to the United Arab Emirates. I am glad to see you again.
In addition to this, I would like to mention that the United Arab Emirates and the Russian Federation have been working together and cooperating within various international frameworks. For example, we work together within BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, where the Emirates were granted dialogue partner status in May 2023. We are also developing and promoting the strategic dialogue between the Russian Federation and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
