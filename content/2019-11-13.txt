With Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Prime Minister, friends,
I am very happy to meet with you again.
Mr Prime Minister, this is our fourth meeting this year. I am very happy about this frequency and would like to note that all agreements reached at our previous meetings are being carried out, including those made during the September summit in Vladivostok. Major bilateral projects are being implemented, military-technical ties are growing stronger, and our humanitarian exchanges are expanding.
I would like to note that in 2018 our trade increased by over 17 percent. Importantly, we are not falling off the pace this year; we are maintaining these dynamics.
We continue to closely coordinate our efforts in the international arena, working together at the UN, the SCO, the G20 and BRICS. Mr Prime Minister, I am looking forward to our meeting in Moscow next May when we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of our Victory in World War II, in the Great Patriotic War.
I am very happy to see you, Mr Prime Minister.
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi (retranslated): Thank you very much.
I am happy that we have the opportunity to meet again and again. Both at bilateral and global meetings we can talk about everything in detail, about many important issues.
You recently invited me to the Eastern Economic Forum, and it made a very good impression on me. I am glad that everything we talked about is being implemented very well. Our oil minister and defence minister were there, and many issues were discussed in detail. Therefore, I believe that our development is moving forward very quickly.
You invited me to Victory Day celebrations in May [2020]. I am glad and look forward to meeting with you again. In addition, in the near future, we will have more different reasons for meeting, and we will have the opportunity to discuss different topics.

With President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
President of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): I am very happy that we have another opportunity to meet again in Brasilia.
Thank you once again for sending me a warm and brilliant message of greetings on the 70th anniversary of the New China.
This year is an important year as China-Russia relations inherit the past and open a way to the new, and continue traditions and look into the future. We have celebrated the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations and held a number of rich and colourful events. The President and I together declared the development of Chinese-Russian relations in a comprehensive strategic partnership in this era by bringing the two countries’ relations to a new historical high and opening broad new prospects for cooperation.
We received reports that at the second China International Import Expo, which just closed, the volume of agreements concluded by Russian participants increased by 74 percent over last year.
The new year must bring new beginnings. Our two sides will continue efforts so as, taking into account the development and changes in the international situation and in accordance with the development needs of each country and their cooperation, to break new ground and innovate, to preserve the trend toward the active and healthy development of China-Russia relations at the highest level, to continuously achieve new results in order not only to support the peoples of China and Russia but also to act for the development and prosperity of the region and the world.
Thank you.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, my friend,
I am also very pleased to meet with you again. I would like to say from the onset that good progress in our bilateral relations has been attained following your state visit to Russia last summer.
Relations between Russia and China are strong and stable, They are not vulnerable to outside influence and they have very good potential for further development. The foundation of our relations is the traditional friendship of our peoples, mutual respect for each other’s interests and close coordination on key global issues.
We hold consultations on the political level and cooperate in the economy and on the global arena. A lot of work is being done in terms of our military-technical cooperation and military interaction in general. This is truly a comprehensive partnership.
I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet with you again and talk about all these issues.
Thank you.
