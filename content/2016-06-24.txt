Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms. Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
Allow me to greet you once again.
India is our privileged strategic partner. Relations between our countries are built on long-standing traditions of friendship. This is fully reflected in our close and effective cooperation in economic and international affairs.
I am sincerely glad that in the course of the SCO
summit today, India signed a memorandum of obligations as a step toward its status as a member of this organisation. I am sure that the membership will happen in the very near future and that next year we will work with India within the framework of the SCO as a full member of this organisation. This will give us an opportunity to work even more closely with our Indian friends now also within the SCO.
This year India has taken over the BRICS
presidency. We are counting very much on your leadership in the organisation and hope that India’s presidency will also help strengthen this widely recognised international organisation, whose influence is steadily growing.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi
(retranslated): Thank you very much, your excellency, for this opportunity to meet with you. Several days ago, we spoke by telephone. The last time I was in Russia, I remember your very warm hospitality.
I would like to thank you for your constructive support of India’s membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Today, we launched the process of India’s acquiring full SCO membership.
I know that you have played a highly constructive role and I thank you for this. All of this goes to show what it means for India to have a true friend. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Address at Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of State expanded session
June 24, 2016

Tashkent
At the expanded format meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of State.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Karimov, colleagues, friends,
We are meeting in an anniversary year. Over these 15 years, the SCO’s authority and its influence on regional processes have increased considerably. Working together within the SCO is one of Russia’s foreign policy priorities. We will continue making active efforts to develop the organisation’s potential and strengthen its role in international and regional affairs.
In our view, the fact that the SCO’s activity is built on the principles of equality, mutual respect and consideration of each other’s interests is a guarantee of its successful development. There are now 18 countries taking part in the organisation’s work: the 6 founding members, 6 observer states, and 6 dialogue partners. These countries together account for more than 16 percent of gross global product, not to mention their share in the world’s population, which stands at 45 percent.
The procedures for India and Pakistan’s accession as full members of the SCO is near completion now. The important political decision to begin the accession procedure was taken last year in Ufa.
One of the outcomes of this year’s summit is the planned signing of memorandums on obligations that India and Pakistan must fulfil in order to become full members of the organisation. We hope that our partners will complete these steps as soon as possible, in time for our next meeting in Kazakhstan.
In the meantime, we need to start directly integrating India and Pakistan into the SCO’s regular cooperation mechanisms such as the Council of Heads of State and the regular meetings of member states’ foreign ministers.
 Since 2005, Iran has been a longstanding and active observer state in the SCO. We think that now that the Iranian nuclear issue has been settled and the UN sanctions lifted, there are no obstacles in the way of a positive assessment of Tehran’s membership application.
Colleagues, the Ufa SCO development strategy drafted last year at Russia’s initiative outlines the main long-term directions for our work together. We will approve today the plan for implementing this strategy through 2020.
This document covers more than 70 political, economic and cultural measures designed to achieve practical results and make our cooperation within the organisation more effective.
Our greatest cooperation priority is certainly ensuring security throughout the SCO area. We also need to continue developing our regional antiterrorist structure’s potential, improve coordination between our security and law enforcement agencies within the framework of the UN and other international organisations, speed up work on drafting the SCO convention on combating extremism, update our anti-narcotics strategy and its implementation programme, and strengthen the legal base for information security cooperation.
Of course, the situation in Afghanistan also requires our particular attention. It is essential to work together with our partners in Afghanistan to step up counterterrorism efforts to combat the terrorist threat in that country and fight cross-border organised crime, prevent drug production and trafficking, and give Afghanistan practical help in its national reconciliation and economic recovery process.
Developing close economic cooperation is another important part of the SCO’s activity. We must continue removing barriers to trade and capital and labour movement, deepen our industrial and technological cooperation, and develop industrial chains and a common transport infrastructure.
The start of talks on linking the Eurasian Union and China’s Silk Road Economic Belt project opens up good prospects in this area. I am sure that involving all of the SCO member states and the CIS countries in this integration process would pave the road for developing a broad Eurasian partnership.
I would like to note that Southeast Asian countries have shown interest in the SCO’s economic dimension. This was something we discussed at the recent Russia-ASEAN summit in Sochi.
Financial development institutes can also contribute to the successful implementation of multilateral economic projects within the SCO framework, particularly the Eurasian Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the BRICS New Development Bank.
The steady development in our humanitarian cooperation within the organisation is certainly cause for satisfaction. The tourism development programme we are adopting today will create a common tourism space and give tourists greater safety.
Among our most significant education projects is the SCO University, which links together around 80 universities from our different countries in a single teaching network. We hope that the intergovernmental agreement regulating this university’s legal status will be signed by the end of this year.
The SCO student forum and youth council play a positive part. Let me mention in particular the initiative to draft the SCO Youth Card, which would offer students discounts on travel, accommodation, and visits to museums and other cultural and historical sites in the member countries.
Colleagues, I would like to conclude by thanking Uzbekistan’s government and President Islam Karimov for the hospitality we have been shown here. I also want to wish success to our Kazakhstani friends, who now take over the presidency in the SCO.
Thank you for your attention.
