President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Holiness, Your Beatitude, Your Eminent Holiness,
I welcome our guests and thank you for accepting the Holy Patriarch’s invitation and coming to visit us today.
Your Beatitude, let me thank you once more for supporting our initiative to build a pilgrims’ house in Jordan, by the River Jordan. 
We have very good relations with Jerusalem. Many Russian pilgrims visit the Holy Land. Our Russian Orthodox Church and the Moscow Patriarchate have a longstanding presence there too. I am very pleased to see that the two sister churches have developed such good relations. 
Your Beatitude, we are always happy to see you. I hope to see you again when we celebrate the 1025th anniversary of the baptism of Rus. I wish you an interesting and productive time here on Russian soil.
Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem: Thank you very much.
Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia: Mr President, I would like to add a word and thank you most sincerely for making possible this meeting, which will undoubtedly strengthen the relations between the Moscow and Jerusalem Patriarchates and will facilitate Russia’s various positive initiatives and undertakings, including its work for peace in the Middle East.
It is therefore so important that the churches also take part in the peace process and work towards peace and justice in this corner of the world that is of such great significance and was sanctified by the footsteps of our Lord and Saviour.

Patriarch Theophilos III (translated from Russian): Your Excellency, Mr President,
It is a great honour and joy and also an emotional moment to be received by you today, together with my brother, His Holiness Patriarch Kirill.
We came here at the invitation of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia as part of the peaceful visit that we are making to the fraternal Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian people, our fellows in the Orthodox faith. 
This is a visit of great importance for us. We see it as a historic event that seals the good relations between our two churches and also the ties that exist between the honourable Russian people and the honourable people of Palestine.Events

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Prime Minister, dear friends, I’m very glad to see you.
I know that you have a busy agenda while you are in Russia. You have already met with Russia’s Prime Minister; you will also be travelling to St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. I am sure that this will be interesting and useful.
We have almost returned to our previous levels of trade; in 2012 we reached pre-crisis levels. I am sure that you and Mr Medvedev discussed in detail almost all areas in which we cooperate.
These include investment cooperation, our traditional cooperation in the energy sector, and new areas, such as mechanical engineering, which represent a continuation of our cooperation in the nuclear power industry. All this is the object of our attention and is supported by both sides.
I’d just like to say at once that we see cooperation with the Czech Republic as cooperation with one of our historical partners and pay a great deal of attention to it.
We are glad to see you, Mr Prime Minister, and your entire delegation in Russia.
Prime Minister of The Czech Republic Petr Necas (re-translated): Mr President, I am extremely pleased that I travelled to Russia with my delegation and a large group of Czech entrepreneurs.
We very much appreciate the active political dialogue underway between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation. And it is gratifying to see that our relations are developing not only at the interstate level, but also at the regional level.
The Russian Federation is a strategic economic partner for the Czech Republic, and we intend to continue developing our historically proven relations. Last year we saw a six percent increase in our trade, and I think that’s good news for both countries. There are some industries, such as energy, in which we traditionally cooperate.
Together with Mr Medvedev, we discussed issues such as, for example, gas and oil and their supply to the Czech Republic. And we also noted that Czech companies are interested not only in trading with Russia, but also in making investments and doing business here.
During my visit a number of memorandums and agreements on hydropower, combined-cycle power plants, mechanical engineering and so on will be signed. We see a considerable potential here for our mutual cooperation, and we want to develop it further.
