President OF RUSSIA DMITRY MEDVEDEV: Good afternoon. Let me first say a few words at the start of today’s meeting.
I want to inform you all that I have just signed an executive order establishing a foundation to support and protect the rights of compatriots living abroad. The foundation’s founders are the Foreign Ministry and the Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States, Compatriots Living Abroad and International Humanitarian Cooperation. 
”I hope that the foundation will be ready from the start of next year to launch regular, systematic, and effective work in protecting the interests of our compatriots abroad.“
The foundation’s purpose is clear from its name. It will be located in Moscow, but will provide support for our compatriots residing in other countries, carrying out legal and organisational work, and providing assistance to our compatriots abroad in the event their lawful rights and interests are violated. Of course it will operate in line with Russian law and international conventions, and with the laws of the countries where our compatriots are living, as necessary.
This endeavour requires certain preparations. I hope that the foundation will be ready from the start of next year to launch regular and systematic work, and hope too that it will prove effective in protecting the interests of our compatriots abroad.
This is an important subject on which I have received a huge amount of correspondence, as I’m sure you all have, and so I wish you all success in this undertaking.
