The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: The Interior Minister is reporting more frequent threats with regard to the Chechen diaspora. I am convinced that terrorists are trying to sow inter-ethnic strife. And I also want to stress that the Chechens, including those in the Chechen Republic, as well as the representatives of other ethnic groups in the Russian Federation, are defending Russian interests and are struggling for a more civilised future for the Chechen Republic. They are fighting the enemy with weapons in hand; and some of them are being killed as a result.
We must do our best to prevent undesirable developments and must not be provoked by criminals. Nor do we have any right to act in violation of the law.
So, let’s discuss this issue and your proposals and let’s settle it for good. Apart from discussing the current situation, I want to ask you to streamline cooperation with our foreign colleagues.
