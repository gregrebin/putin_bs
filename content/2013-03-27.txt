Press statement following the BRICS summit

Durban
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Zuma, heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen,
Russia will continue developing close cooperation with its BRICS
partners and will do everything it can to facilitate the group’s development.
Our hosts’ active position has enabled us to hold a very energetic and productive summit. The eThekwini Declaration that we approved today reflects in full our countries’ common positions on a wide range of global political and economic issues.
The ambitious BRICS Action Plan for the coming year that we adopted today includes new areas of cooperation such as information security, joint efforts to combat drugs trafficking and terrorism, and promotion of youth and educational exchanges.
Economic partnership issues were discussed in detail at the summit. Russia supports the establishment of the BRICS Development Bank. We think that work should now continue at the expert level to settle the principles and rules for the institution’s operations.
The BRICS countries are aware of their role and responsibility as global growth leaders. As has already been noted today, our countries account for more than 27 percent of world gross domestic product – a total of $15.4 trillion.
We reaffirmed our commitment to continue expand trade and investment flows, strengthen our technical and industrial cooperation, stimulate the growth of our huge domestic markets, and carry out mutually advantageous business projects in third countries.
Russia put forward the initiative to draft a long-term economic cooperation strategy that would take into account national development plans and help to consolidate growth in all of the BRICS economies.
The summit paid particular attention to expanding business ties. We hope that the establishment of the BRICS Business Council will bring new substance and initiatives to our business communities’ work.
It is symbolic that all of our countries are putting the emphasis on not just the pace but also the quality of economic growth. This requires us to introduce the most stringent and advanced environmental and nature protection standards.
In this respect I note the signing of the multilateral agreement on financing green economy projects, including use of energy-saving technology and recycling of raw materials.
Development assistance is another important aspect of our work together, and in this respect we have signed the multilateral agreement on co-financing infrastructure projects in Africa. This shows the BRICS group’s interest in expanding our cooperation with the African continent.
In conclusion, I want to thank the hosts and organisers of today’s summit for their hard work and for their leadership in reaching the results achieved today.
Thank you all very much.

With President of Egypt Mohamed Morsi.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very happy to meet you in person.
We have already talked several times over the phone. We have an opportunity to meet here, on the sidelines of BRICS summit, to talk about our cooperation.
Our countries have always shared a special relationship and we in Russia have always had particularly warm feelings toward the Egyptian people.
This year marks seventy years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our nations. In spite of various problems in the global economy, our trade is growing and in the last two years it grew by 70%.
We have many promising areas for cooperation. I am very happy for the opportunity to meet you, make your acquaintance and discuss all these areas.
President of Egypt Mohamed Morsi
(retranslated): Mr President, I am very pleased to have this meeting with you today.
Just like you, I have awaited the opportunity to make your acquaintance in person, to discuss the relations of strategic partnership that have tied our countries for 70 years, and these relations have always been warm. I would like for our relations to keep their dynamic momentum in the present.

I am referring to a wide variety of areas for cooperation. These include political cooperation, the coordination of our positions regarding regional and global issues. Naturally, they also include science and technology cooperation between our states, cooperation in developing and transferring technologies, using the Russian Federation’s wealth of experience in this area.
Of course, this applies to a wide range of areas in economic cooperation. These include manufacturing, mutual trade and energy. And I would like to open a new page in our relations as far as the gas sector is concerned, I mean Egyptian gas supplies to Russia.
Naturally, there are also many other promising areas for cooperation, which I discussed with Mr Lavrov when he visited Cairo. I’m sure that he reported to you on that visit.
We consider our meeting with you today a kind of prelude to my visit to the Russian Federation, which I would very much like to make in the near future.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, you have my invitation. We will find a date for your visit through our foreign ministries.
I will be happy to meet with you at a time that is convenient for you.
Mohamed Morsi: I will also be very happy to make that visit and I hope that we will soon agree on the dates for that trip.
