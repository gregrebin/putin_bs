President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends and colleagues,
I am truly pleased to see that the traditionally friendly relations between our countries, our cooperation and privileged strategic partnership are developing so well. We are continuing the best traditions of interstate relations that were established decades ago.
Next year we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of Russian-Indian diplomatic relations. Mr Prime Minister made an excellent proposal to develop a roadmap for celebrating this event properly.
We continue close political contacts throughout the forums and all international organisations. The inter-governmental commission meets on a regular basis. We are building up military ties and cooperation in military production.
Mr Prime Minister, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to meet today in such an expanded format and discuss in detail all the areas of cooperation with our colleagues and make one more serious step towards strengthening our links, friendship and partnership.
Thank you very much.
