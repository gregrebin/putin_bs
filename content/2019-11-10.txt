President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear Ms Pakhmutova,
Allow me to sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, wish you a very happy birthday.
I would like to thank you for everything you did for our country and for our people. This is no exaggeration: Many generations of our citizens live their lives with your music.
I know that you compose different kinds of music – for symphony orchestras, music for ballets and choir music. However, the music you wrote for songs is most widely known among our people and it penetrates our very souls.
Why does it move us all so much? Because, though it has its own author – you, it is truly people’s music. I was wondering how you manage to do this. I have a feeling that you get to capture souls with you talented warm hands, look into them and take out the most important thing. And what is the most important thing? It is love. Love of Fatherland, of Motherland, love for your beloved ones, family, children, love for your profession, of the cause a person serves. This is why the music moves people so much; it enchants them with its impeccable pattern, its profoundness and warmth.
Throughout all your life you have been engaged in public activities, but I know from your own words that your primary public activities were the so called patronage concerts – for the military, company workers and students. And why? It is again your direct involvement with people.
Dear Ms Pakhmutova, let me inform you that I have signed an Executive Order awarding the highest order of our country – the Order of St Andrew the Apostle. I hope I will have the honour and pleasure to present it to you at a ceremony in the Moscow Kremlin, as it should be awarded.
Dear Ms Pakhmutova, it is certainly your birthday today, and you should be the centre of attention. But I must say a few words about the man who has been by your side and shared everything with you, including your creative work – Nikolai Dobronravov.
We have a tradition in Russia not to give early birthday wishes, Mr Dobronravov, and I don’t mean to break this rule. However, I know that your birthday is coming soon, in 12 days if I am not mistaken. You are just one year older.
But I know how much you mean to one another, and your creative potential has been used in the best possible way for our country. Everything you do together, what Ms Pakhmutova does, is undoubtedly our national treasure and honor to Russia.
Allow me to wish you all the very best, family happiness, wellbeing and health.
Thank you very much.
Alexandra Pakhmutova: Thank you.
Mr President,
Thank you very much for such words of praise, for the kind words you have said to me, for the high award I am to receive. St Andrew the Apostle was a great man, a great martyr and it is a great honour for me to receive this award.
I want to wish you happiness, health, very strong health, because we have great people, we have a great country, and things are not always easy for us. It is my hope that all the good, uplifting and kind things that you wish to do for country come true, and I wish you happiness and good health.
Thank you very much.
