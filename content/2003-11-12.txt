The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin (speaking after Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee): Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me real pleasure to once again welcome our honoured guest, the Prime Minister of India, Mr Vajpayee. We see this visit as an important step in the development of our bilateral relations. Our relations were always built and continue to be founded on the principle of equality and are developing in a spirit of friendship and openness.
The outcome of these talks is that we have signed a Declaration on Global Challenges and Threats to International Security and Stability. This declaration sets out the main areas for cooperation between our two countries on the international stage in the 21st century. As the Prime Minister noted, one of the most serious modern threats we face is terrorism. Other challenges before us are drugs, organised crime and other problems afflicting the modern world.
We are working together on building up the international legal framework we need for cooperation in the fight against terrorism. In this respect I would like to express our gratitude to our Indian colleagues for their support for Russia’s initiatives on creating a global system to counteract the new threats and challenges we face. We share a common approach to the majority of global problems. We are united in our determination to achieve serious results in resolving the problems the world community faces, and we are united in our belief that this can only be done through coordinated collective efforts and with the United Nations playing a central role.
We also discussed the situation in South Asia. Russia welcomes India’s new initiatives to improve relations with Pakistan.
During our talks we had a detailed discussion on the prospects for our bilateral cooperation. We believe it is important to develop all the aspects of the Russian-Indian strategic partnership. We discussed carrying out a number of major projects, which my colleague just mentioned. We also talked about partnership in science and technology and military-technical cooperation, and about the promising objectives that our two countries have in this area.
Our common priorities include increasing our mutual trade turnover, giving the private sector a greater role in trade and economic cooperation and strengthening ties in the high-technology sector and in banking contracts. It is also our firm intention to develop inter-regional ties, humanitarian contacts between people and scientific and cultural exchanges.
Next year we plan to hold a cultural event, Days of Indian Culture in the Russian Federation, and we are sure that this will be a success.
The substantial package of documents that was signed today aims directly at reaching precisely the objectives I referred to.
In conclusion I would like to note particularly that these talks have confirmed the trust inherent in our dialogue and the uniqueness and diversity of Russian-Indian strategic cooperation. I am confident that our relations will continue to develop rapidly and positively in the interests of our peoples and in the interests of peace and stability in the world.
I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his invitation to visit India. We will agree on a date through the Foreign Ministry.
Thank you for your attention.

The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, esteemed Indian colleagues, friends, allow me to welcome you once again to Moscow.
The Indian Prime Minister’s official visit to Russia is without doubt a major event in Russian-Indian relations this year. Almost a year has gone by since our last summit, which was held in your country. This year has seen a lot of substantial work take place to implement the agreements that we reached in New Delhi.
Both yesterday and today we held talks with the Prime Minister, and these talks reaffirm our conviction that this visit will serve as an important milestone in strengthening the strategic partnership between our two countries, between India and the Russian Federation.

Opening Remarks at a Meeting with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
November 12, 2003
20:37
The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, let me once again wish you a warm welcome to Moscow. I think we spent a useful and pleasant several hours in discussion yesterday. Our talks began yesterday evening. Today I would like to once again note the intensity with which ties between India and the Russian Federation are developing.
Our ties are developing in the political sphere, on the international stage, and we are very glad of this, but they are also strengthening in the area of military-technical cooperation and in the economic sphere in general. We are seeing positive growth in our economic relations. During our best years, the 1980s, Russia accounted for approximately $3.5 billion of the foreign trade turnover between the Soviet Union and India. Over the first nine months of 2003, we have reached a figure of $2 billion. There is room for further growth, but the pace is good.
There is plenty for us to discuss, as we share many mutual interests and problems. We are very pleased to see you here, Mr Prime Minister.
