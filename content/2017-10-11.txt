President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you to Sochi for the Summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
I would like to note that President of Moldova Igor Dodon and President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev are taking part in the event for the first time. My special greetings to you on this occasion.
The summit agenda is very busy. We will chart the path for further strengthening interaction within the CIS and exchange opinions on what should be done to make the Commonwealth and its structures more efficient.
Traditionally, we will pay special attention to economic topics. We will discuss steps aimed at deepening trade and investment ties and at eliminating existing barriers to the movement of goods and services. We have everything it takes to launch major new mutually beneficial business projects.
During the course of this summit, some important decisions in the humanitarian field are to be approved. We are convinced that their implementation will help strengthen neighbourly relations between our countries and peoples and contribute to expanding exchanges in the field of culture, education, science and tourism. We are going to discuss this today.
I suggest that, as usual, we give the floor to the Chairman of the Executive Committee and Executive Secretary of the CIS Sergei Lebedev. Then each of us will speak on the substance of the issues we have gathered today to discuss.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Berdimuhamedov, friends and colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you again, this time to Sochi, Russia. Thank you for accepting our invitation to the CIS
summit.
We met in Turkmenistan recently, and we recollect with pleasure the warm welcome we received there. Thank you very much. We signed a number of fundamentally important documents there, including the [Strategic Cooperation] Treaty. I hope that all of them will be implemented, which will improve our interstate relations, primarily in the economy and the social sphere.
As I have said, we are grateful for your assistance in promoting the Russian language, which is important for our people who have lived in a unified state for a long time, or more precisely, for centuries. And now they maintain direct ties with each other.
I would like to again express our sincere gratitude, personally and on behalf of all my colleagues, for the work we accomplished during my official visit to Turkmenistan.
President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov
: Mr Putin, thank you for your kind words about Turkmenistan.
I would like to begin with a pleasant mission. You recently had a good day, your name day, on which I would like to congratulate you. I wish you strong health, which is the most important thing, as well as success and all the best.
I know that you are doing a great deal to improve the environment, both in your country and in the world. We have a close friend. You probably know what I mean: it is a dog, an Alabai. I have brought an Alabai puppy for you today. The dog’s name is Wepaly (Faithful). I believe this is a popular dog name in Russia as well. The Alabai was the mascot of the Asian [Indoor and Martial Arts] Games, which we hosted recently. I believe we can show the dog to the journalists.
Vladimir Putin: Of course, we can.
Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov: I think you will like him. Our dogs are healthy.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, I do know that. (Laughs.)
Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov: But the most important thing is that they are very faithful dogs.
I would like to again thank you for inviting us to attend the meeting of the CIS Council of Heads of State. This is very important to us, because this international organisation is a major asset. So, we would like to once again thank you for inviting us here.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
