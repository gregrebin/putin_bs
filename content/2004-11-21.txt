Opening Remarks at a Meeting with Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo Manrique
November 21, 2004

Santiago, Chile
President Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I’m very glad to be talking to you in this format, though we have been working together all day. Yes, I know that you have questions regarding bilateral relations. I would be pleased to discuss them.
Alejandro Toledo: Mr President, I would first like to thank you for this opportunity to meet so late at night.
Secondly, I’d like to ask you a multilateral question. I am chairman of the Andean community. We are currently negotiating your association with the Andean community. We have struck a strategic alliance with Brazil and my friend President Lula. We are closely following the situation in Russia. Despite the distance, the technological progress brings the world closer, and in particular, our continent and Russia. But business volume between our countries is too small.
I am not complaining, I talking about our potential, above all, the potential of investment co-operation. It is one of the ways for our peoples to get to know each other better, to know their national identity, with mutual respect for our cultural differences. With this approach of Latin America looking for co-operation with Russia and Asian nations, I want to tell you, Mr President, that my government has decided to recognise Russia’s economy as market economy. I am ready to announce this tonight or tomorrow.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Mr President. I think that this will further encourage our ties. We are seriously interested in bilateral relations with many Latin American countries and in unification, including with MERCOSUR nations.

Beginning of the Meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
November 21, 2004
00:03
Santiago, Chile
President Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, it is very pleasing for me to have the opportunity to make use of our meeting here in Chile, to hold a bilateral meeting with you. I note with pleasure that despite a series of undecided issues, relations between our countries are developing. At any rate, today we are able to discuss everything, even the most difficult issues, as partners, and even as friends.
Last year, trade between our countries grew by 54%. The investment component is also growing. Japanese companies take an active part in a number of energy projects in the Far East, on Sakhalin. And we will welcome and support the activity of Japanese companies on the Russian market, and in the Russian economy.
There are many events ahead of us next year, which I believe marks 150 years since official diplomatic relations were established with Japan. I would propose to remember these events in a positively and celebrate this date. I am very happy to see you, dear colleagues.
Junichiro Koizumi: I am very happy to meet with you, Mr President, after our meeting on Sea Island.
I would like to take this opportunity to give my sincere thanks for the assistance that Russia gave us in the earthquake in the Ningata prefecture.
I am very happy that at the recent meeting of foreign ministers, an agreement was reached on holding regular meetings between foreign ministers, in order to develop our relations in the future.
During our meeting in Sea Island we agreed that your visit to Japan would be held at a time that is convenient for you, and we will organize for your visit to be held next year. This indeed will mark the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
