President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you for making this visit. I know you have many problems at home, but I believe that bilateral relations between Russia and Egypt, which were 70 years old last year, are worth it.
I would like once again to wish you and all your colleagues success in your work for the benefit of the people of Egypt.
FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY INDUSTRY OF EGYPT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President, for providing this opportunity to exchange views on the most pressing issues, to discuss them in an atmosphere of sincerity, mutual trust and sympathy.
I am happy to note the degree of mutual trust and understanding that was demonstrated in the course of our talks today. This makes us very optimistic – optimistic regarding the future of Egypt, among other things.
We are certainly interested in various forms of cooperation with Russia to provide for a dignified lifestyle for our people. I believe other nations in the world share this interest. We have always been in favour of stability and peace in the world.
Thank you once again for finding the time to see me.
