Russky Island, Vladivostok
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chairman,
I am very pleased to meet with you in Russia. Our colleagues agreed to hold this meeting a long time ago.
First of all, allow me to congratulate you on your election to the high office of the Head of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I sent you a letter of congratulations to this effect at the time, but now I have the pleasure to convey my congratulations to you in person.
In this connection, let me note that last year we marked 70 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. The founder of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea paid his first visit to Moscow in 1949. I also remember my visit to your country.
Your father was among those who spearheaded the signing of the Treaty of Friendship between our countries, which is a fundamental instrument. I have no doubt that today’s visit to Russia will help further develop bilateral relations and help us better understand ways of bringing about a settlement on the Korean Peninsula, what we can do together, and what Russia can do to facilitate the positive processes that we are witnessing today.
We certainly welcome your efforts to promote inter-Korean dialogue and normalisation in DPRK-US relations.
Of course, there is a lot we have to achieve on the bilateral track to promote trade and economic relations, as well as cultural and educational ties.
Welcome!
Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK Kim Jong-un (retranslated): I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your kind invitation and for paying so much attention to my visit despite your extremely packed schedule. You have travelled thousands of kilometres from Moscow in order to meet me here.
I would also like to congratulate you on the fact that last year the people of Russia elected you as the head of Great Russia, as well as on your successful efforts to build a stronger Russia.
Mr President, just as you, I hope that our meeting will help strengthen and expand the traditional and long-standing ties of friendship between DPRK and Russia.
I would also like to say that the international community has been following very closely the latest developments on the Korean Peninsula. I hope that our talks make a significant contribution to this process, by offering us an opportunity to assess these developments, exchange views and combine our efforts to settle this matter. I look forward to a meaningful exchange of opinions today.
Vladimir Putin: I am sure it will be that way.
Thank you very much.

Speeches at the official reception on behalf of the President of Russia
April 25, 2019
12:00
Russky Island, Vladivostok
At the official reception on behalf of the President of Russia in honour of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK Kim Jong-un.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade Chairman, friends,
Allow me to once again welcome Comrade Kim Jong-un and all our Korean colleagues to the Russian Federation.
In 2002, it was here in Vladivostok that we greeted your father, Kim Jong Il, who always commanded a lot of respect in Russia. Today we have held very constructive and business-like talks in a friendly atmosphere as is always the case in the relations between our two countries.
Let me remind you that last year Russia and the DPRK marked 70 years since the establishment of our diplomatic ties. We reached this milestone against the backdrop of a challenging international environment. Nevertheless we see that the situation around the Korean Peninsula is becoming increasingly stable, which is largely attributable to Comrade Kim Jong-un’s initiatives. Russia seeks to proactively facilitate progress toward a political and diplomatic settlement. We welcome DPRK’s steps to establish direct dialogue with the United States and normalise relations between North and South Korea. We proceed from the premise that there is no alternative to a peaceful resolution of the nuclear and other problems in the region.
For its part, Russia stands ready to stay involved in efforts to ease tension on the peninsula and strengthen security in Northeast Asia in general. As a Korean saying goes, by joining forces, you can move a mountain. We strongly believe that this is the path towards success. With the proactive support of the international community and all interested countries, we will definitely achieve the goal of building a strong peace, stability and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.
I raise a toast to further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, for the prosperity of the peoples of our countries, and for the health of Chairman Kim Jong-un and all those present here today.
Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un (retranslated): President Vladimir Putin, Russian friends,
We have come to our friendly neighbour, the Russian Federation, and are having a landmark meeting with President Vladimir Putin.
First of all, let me express my sincere gratitude to you, Mr President, for inviting us, flying here from faraway Moscow despite your busy political schedule and covering thousands of kilometres to show us your hospitality.
I would also like to thank our Russian friends for their care and the enormous efforts taken to successfully organise my first visit to Russia. I would like to take this opportunity to send best regards on behalf of all the Koreans to the Russian people who work tirelessly to build a strong and prosperous Russia.
Friends and comrades, I have come to the Russian Federation with the firm intention to carry on Russian-Korean friendship, which has deep historical roots and long-standing traditions, and to give an impetus to the further development of Russian-Korean relations in accordance with our people’s aspirations and the demands of rapidly changing new visions.
I am pleased to note that our important meeting today is a natural result of the friendship between our two countries which has been present for a long time. Despite the long distance between Moscow and Pyongyang, Russia and North Korea are friendly neighbours with a common border along a river. Russian-Korean friendly relations are an invaluable asset to our countries. They have been developing based on historical traditions, shared goals and interests.
The peoples of our countries have been bound by their camaraderie in arms ever since they fought side by side in the great anti-Japanese war in the last century, while the valiant Red Army soldiers and officers did not hesitate when it came to spilling their blood in the name of liberating Korea. Years and centuries go by, but our people remember and will always cherish the memory of the noble deeds of Russia’s sons and daughters, who fought on international detachments and sacrificed their lives for the sacred cause of liberating Korea.
The precious feeling of friendship between our peoples took shape and consolidated as we faced multiple challenges and tests. Accordingly, our peoples strongly believe that consistent efforts to promote North Korea-Russia relations not only serve our common interests, but are critical for ensuring peace and security in the region. Our peoples are eager to bring North Korea-Russia friendly relations to a new, higher level. The people of North Korea have friendly, brotherly feelings toward the people of Russia and are proud to have a great country like Russia as a close neighbour.
Today, I had a frank and meaningful exchange of opinions with President Putin on promoting friendly relations between North Korea and Russia, ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the region, as well as on international matters of mutual interest. The DPRK government and I share the unwavering strategic commitment to consistently promote as well as to strengthen strategic relations and traditional friendship between North Korea and Russia, bringing them to a new level in keeping with the imperatives of our time.
Dear Russian friends,
The brotherly people of Russia supports Mr Putin’s proactive leadership, commitment and strong will, and achieves marvellous success in building a strong and prosperous Russia, while overcoming multiple challenges within and beyond Russia. It is a great joy for us to witness this success, as if it was our own.
I sincerely wish that Russia prosper as a strong, proud and great country under the leadership of President Putin. I raise this toast for the development and prosperity of the great Russian Federation, for the good health of President Putin, for the happiness and wonderful future of the peoples of our countries, and for the health of all comrades and friends who are present here today.

News conference following Russian-North Korean talks
Following his talks with Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin answered media questions.

News conference following Russian-North Korean talks.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon,
I suggest that we go straight to questions and answers. I will try to answer your questions. Go ahead, please.
Question: Mr President, this was your first meeting with Kim Jong-un. There is significant interest towards him as a person around the world. Could you share with us your impressions about him as a person and a politician, and whether you are satisfied with the outcomes of the talks?
Vladimir Putin: Yes, my colleagues and I are all satisfied with the outcomes of the talks. Chairman Kim Jong-un is quite an open person and speaks freely. We had a very detailed conversation on all items on our agenda and discussed them in various aspects, including bilateral relations, sanctions, United Nations, relations with the United States, and, of course, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, which is the main subject. I can confirm that he is quite an interesting and substantive interlocutor.
Question: Mr President, coming out of these talks, what in your opinion are the real prospects for denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and for Pyongyang and Seoul to improve their relations? What needs to be done to achieve this? What steps need to be taken and what barriers will have to be overcome? What prevents the parties from reaching common ground?
Vladimir Putin: The most important thing, as we have discussed today during the talks, is to restore the rule of international law and revert to the position where global developments were regulated by international law instead of the rule of force. If this happens, this would be the first and critical step toward resolving challenging situations such as the one on the Korean Peninsula.
So, what is denuclearisation all about? It implies North Korea’s disarmament to a certain extent. Naturally (I have noted this on numerous occasions and can confirm this once again), the North Korean side is also talking about this. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea needs guarantees of its security and sovereignty.
But what guarantees can there be, except those based on international law? We can think about international guarantees, and this would probably be correct. But these guarantees also lie in the sphere of international law. Therefore we will not invent anything new here.
How substantial will these guarantees be, and to what extent will they meet the interests of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea? It is still too early to talk about this today, but it is necessary to take the first steps towards strengthening trust. To my mind, this seems possible on the whole.
It was possible as far back as 2005, when the United States and North Korea signed the relevant treaty and agreement. For some reason, our American partners suddenly decided that the provisions stipulated and coordinated by the United States were not exhaustive, and that it was necessary to add something else there. These aspects were included in the treaty, and North Korea immediately withdrew from it.
If we act like this, and if we take one step forward and two backwards, then we would fail to achieve the desired result. But it will eventually be possible to achieve this goal, if we move forward gradually and if we respect each other’s interests (here I am talking about all the parties involved in resolving the North Korean problem or the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula), if we move ahead carefully, and if we respect each other and each other’s interests.
Question: Could you please tell us if you are planning to inform Donald Trump of today’s meeting or discuss the results of the talks with your other colleagues, due to gather in Beijing tomorrow? To what extent do Russia’s and US efforts correlate on the Korean track, and do the interests of our countries regarding the situation around the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea coincide?
Vladimir Putin: They coincide in some respects.
Of course, I will certainly speak with the leadership of the People’s Republic of China in Beijing tomorrow. But we will also discuss this matter and today’s meeting with US leadership in the same open and candid manner. There are no secrets here; Russia always voices an open position, there are no conspiracies. Moreover, Chairman Kim Jong-un himself asked us to inform the US side about his position, about his questions arising in connection with processes on the Korean Peninsula and everything taking place around this. Therefore, I repeat, there are no secrets here. We will also discuss this with the Americans and our Chinese friends.
Regarding your question as to whether our interests coincide with those of the United States on this issue, I can say that this is also true. For example, we advocate complete denuclearisation: this is a fact. Actually, we completely oppose the global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And that is why a considerable share of steps within the framework of the United Nations is being coordinated. True, we will not conceal the fact that the sides often wrangle over specific clauses while making the decisions, and you know this well. But, naturally, we prioritise efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear conflicts; this is our common priority.
But I have the impression that the North Korean leader also shares this viewpoint. All they need is national security guarantees. Everyone must think about this together.
Question: During Kim Jong Il’s rule, Russia planned to build a gas pipeline to South Korea via North Korea and to upgrade railways in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. But many of these projects are in limbo because Pyongyang now faces sanctions. Did you discuss these projects with Kim Jong-un? Is the Russian side interested in these projects today?
Vladimir Putin: I spoke about this. We have been talking about this matter for many years. This includes direct railway traffic between South Korea, North Korea and Russia, including our Trans-Siberian Mainline, opportunities for laying pipelines – we can talk about both oil and gas, as well as the possible construction of new power transmission lines.
All of this is possible. Moreover, in my opinion, this is also in the interests of the Republic of Korea, I have always had this impression. But, apparently, there is a shortage of sovereignty during the adoption of final decisions, and the Republic of Korea has certain allied obligations before the United States. Therefore, everything stops at a certain moment. As I see it, if these and other similar projects were implemented, this would create essential conditions for increasing trust, which is vitally needed to resolve various problems.
North and South Korean railways have linked up not so long ago. In principle, there is a connection to Russia already. So far we have been unable to operate trains there, even in the test mode. We will work on this steadily, intensively and patiently. I hope that we will be able to accomplish this someday. The sooner we do this, the better.
Question: Is Kim Jong-un ready to continue contacts with the United States of America? And what is the North Korean leader’s mood?
Vladimir Putin: First of all, he is determined to defend his country’s national interests and to maintain its security. If North Korea’s partners (I am talking about the Americans, in the first place) voice a desire for constructive dialogue, then I believe that it will eventually prove impossible to do without talks. As I see it, there is no other way. But you had better ask him about what he can or cannot agree to.
Question: Has the topic of North Koreans who work in Russia been raised during the talks? They are supposed to leave our country, but they do not want to. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, we talked about this. There are several different options here. There are humanitarian issues, and there are issues related to the exercising of these people’s rights. There are smooth, non-confrontational solutions. I must say that the Koreans work well for us, never giving the local authorities any trouble. They are very hardworking people, law-abiding and disciplined. We discussed it.
Question: In the 2000s, there was a six-party format for mediating the Korean issue, and the parties even managed to achieve some agreements. However, for obvious reasons, the format has now been suspended. Do you think it makes sense to revive it under the current conditions?
Vladimir Putin: I do not know whether this format should be resumed right now, but I am deeply convinced that if we reach a situation when we need to work out certain guarantees for one of the parties, in this case, security guarantees for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, then international guarantees will have to come into the picture. It is unlikely that agreements between two countries will be enough.
But ultimately, it is up to the country that it primarily concerns, so it is primarily up to North Korea. If that country deems guarantees only from the United States or from its southern neighbour, South Korea, the Republic of Korea, to be enough – well, good. If this is not enough, which is more likely, I think, and if we get to that at all, which we would like very much, then this six-party talks format will certainly be highly relevant to develop a system of international security guarantees for North Korea.
Question: Mr President, yesterday you signed an executive order introducing a fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports to Lugansk residents. Are you aware of the fact that the response around the world and in Ukraine to this initiative was overwhelmingly negative? By doing so, aren’t you provoking the country’s new president, Vladimir Zelensky?
Vladimir Putin: Are you saying that there was a negative response? It is strange when decisions of this kind are met with a negative response. Let me explain. Poland, for example, has been issuing identity cards to ethnic Poles for as long as ten years, I think, since 2009. Hungary and Romania went as far as give away passports to ethnic Hungarians and Romanians, respectively.
In this connection there is a question: are ethnic Russians living in Ukraine worse than Romanians, Poles or Hungarians, or Ukrainians who live there but feel an unbreakable bond with Russia due to various circumstances (family ties, mixed marriages or other considerations)? I do not see anything extraordinary in this regard.
Moreover, when other countries neighbouring Ukraine have been doing the same for many years, why should Russia refrain from taking the same steps, especially since people living in Donetsk and Lugansk republics are in a much more challenging situation than the ethnic Poles, Romanians and Hungarians living in Ukraine? In fact, they face a lot of hardship. They are deprived of the most basic human rights, for example in education. They even have problems moving around Ukraine or third countries, and even in Russia. Sometimes they cannot even buy a plane or train ticket. This is beyond all reason.
As for provoking anyone, the government and I personally are far from provoking anyone. The question of passports is a purely humanitarian issue and nothing more. As for the current Ukrainian authorities and those set to replace them, both the outgoing and the incoming leadership, as far as I know, and judging by their public statements, have never intended and will not sign off on an amnesty bill. They do not intend to recognise the special status of the Lugansk and Donetsk people’s republics. These are the key provisions of the Minsk Agreements. This means that they do not intend to implement the Minsk Agreements.
But what about the people who live there? Will they be abandoned? Will they continue to live in complete isolation? After all, it was not Russia that isolated them, but the Kiev authorities. We were not the ones who did it. This also directly contradicts the Minsk Agreements. They have not restored anything, neither the economic ties, nor financial relations. Nothing. In addition, these people face humanitarian issues. It goes without saying that we cannot stand by and just let it be this way.
That said, provoking anyone is not what we are after. If Ukraine’s incoming leadership finds the courage to implement the Minsk Agreements, we will facilitate these efforts and will do everything to bring the situation back to normal in southeast Ukraine.
Question: To continue on the subject, what is your general assessment of the election in Ukraine? What do you think about the development of Russian-Ukrainian relations with the new President?
Vladimir Putin: I do not know. It will depend on the policy pursued by Ukraine’s new political leadership. We want and are ready to restore these relations in full but we cannot do it unilaterally.
As for my assessment, what is there to assess? This is a complete failure of Poroshenko’s policy. Complete and absolute. I am sure that the new authorities are bound to understand this. They are well aware of this. Let’s look at their first steps at least. Understanding is one thing but adopting a realistic policy in the interests of one’s nation is another.
Question: To continue the topic of your executive order, Poroshenko is now trying to rally his partners to convene the UN Security Council. As for the Western reaction, the term of “territorial integrity” is being used. Does your executive order concern Ukraine’s territorial integrity because the President that is still in office qualified it as an attempt at annexation and formation of a Russian enclave on Ukrainian territory?
Vladimir Putin: Look, I think I have already answered this question. When other neighbouring states issued passports, there were no attempts to submit this question to the UN Security Council. But why are they being made in this case? What is the difference? There is none at all. The only thing is that people living in the Lugansk and Donetsk people’s republics are in a much worse position. This is a humanitarian issue. Well, let him submit it and we will discuss it.
At one time Mr Poroshenko suggested there should be a UN presence on these territories for protecting and ensuring the security of OSCE observers. We agreed but our Ukrainian partners instantly rejected the idea. They demanded more than that, notably, that everything should be transferred to the UN forces. This is a separate issue and it may be discussed. However, this is not a desire to resolve the issue through dialogue with the people who live on these territories. These are all attempts to bend them in this or that way, to resolve these issues by using force, either directly or indirectly, and, in effect to settle the legitimacy issue with regard to the government produced by the coup d’état.
Thank you. I wish you all the best.

Interview to Chinese newspaper People’s Daily
Ahead of his working visit to China, Vladimir Putin gave an interview to the Chinese newspaper People’s Daily (Renmin Ribao).
April 25, 2019
01:00
Question: In 2017 you attended the Belt and Road international forum. Could you share with us your impressions? What successes were achieved in the past two years in your opinion? And what are the areas we still have to work on? What topics are you interested in at the second forum?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: In historical terms, the two years that have passed since the first Belt and Road international forum in Beijing are a short span of time. However, it is already clear that President Xi Jinping’s initiative is really opening up extensive opportunities for equitable partnership. Our Chinese friends take a creative approach to promoting international economic cooperation, and seek to contribute to consolidating interconnected relationships and ensuring sustainable development in the whole of Eurasia. Such a desire can only be welcomed.
Naturally, it is important for China to successfully promote this large-scale project. And all Eurasian states should stand to gain from participation in it. It should help them build up their economic potential, make them more competitive and increase their living standards. To achieve this it is necessary to take into account the interests of all partners and to promote the harmonisation of national programmes and development plans. It is necessary not only to trade but also to promote mutual investment and carry out joint infrastructure, transport, logistics and environmental projects; to encourage industrial and technological cooperation, scientific and academic exchanges, and step up people-to-people contacts.
Russia also has its own vision for the future of regional integration. Together with other member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) we are consistently searching for the optimal model of cooperation. I am referring to the plans to form the Greater Eurasian Partnership or, in other words, a broad network of regional integration associations developing in a coordinated way, based on the principles of equality, openness, mutual respect and consideration of each other’s interests. It is hard to overstate China’s role in this as Russia’s strategic partner. After all, the formation of Greater Eurasia essentially amounts to coupling the EAEU and the Belt and Road concept.
Question: You suggested coupling the EAEU with the Belt and Road initiative. Are you satisfied with the progress toward linking these two projects? What are your expectations in this regard?
Vladimir Putin: Indeed, in May 2015, President Xi Jinping and I agreed to link the construction of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Silk Road Economic Belt. This truly historic initiative was supported by the leaders of all the EAEU member states.
On May 17, 2018, the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation between the EAEU and China was signed as a follow-up to this initiative. We expect this document to enter into force within the next few months, and the parties will immediately begin to implement it.
Practical cooperation between the Eurasian Economic Commission and the Government of the People's Republic of China will need to be put on solid footing and made systematic. Our top priority will be to set up a Joint Commission tasked with reviewing specific initiatives to couple the EAEU with China’s Belt and Road initiative. We believe that projects in transport, energy, environment, trade, finance and the digital economy will enjoy priority.
I am confident that following the upcoming 2nd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, in which I plan to take part, the integration processes promoted by our countries in the Eurasian space will receive another powerful boost.
Question: You have met with President Xi Jinping many times and, as leaders, have mapped out important plans to develop Russian-Chinese relations. What is the role of meetings between the leaders in promoting bilateral relations?
Vladimir Putin: You correctly noted that I regularly meet with President Xi Jinping. I value the relations of friendship and mutual respect that have developed between us, which make it possible to build on bilateral cooperation in all areas from politics and trade to military-technical and humanitarian areas.
Of course, that kind of trust-based dialogue helps more effectively coordinate the positions of Russia and China on key issues of the international and regional agenda and jointly develop responses to the most pressing challenges of our time.
As I noted earlier, our next meeting will take place in Beijing quite soon. We will talk not only during the Belt and Road Forum, which I already mentioned, but will also hold talks as part of the bilateral meeting of the leaders of Russia and China. And we look forward to President Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia this year.
Question: This year we mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. What do you think about the level of our relations and the potential for their further development?
Vladimir Putin: It would be no exaggeration to say that our countries have approached this anniversary with relations the best they have been in their entire history. This is the result of meticulous and successful work over the past thirty years. Russia and China have fully normalised bilateral ties and raised them to the level of strategic partnership. They have resolved all sensitive issues, including the border one.
The further deepening of cooperation between the two states promises to be sustainable and long-term, because it is not opportunistic. This is entirely in the interests of our peoples and the tasks of maintaining international and regional security and stability.
The political dialogue between Russia and China is based on mutual trust and respect, and the fact that we always take each other’s approaches and positions into consideration. We have developed contacts at all levels – from the very top to the expert level. Our parliaments, public organisations and, of course, business communities are actively engaged in our common efforts.
Our military and military-technical cooperation points to the high level of trust. Russia and China hold regular joint exercises and share our accumulated experience in military development. Our cooperation on security and combatting terrorism and organised crime is making rapid headway.
We have managed to substantially increase our mutual trade. In 2018 it exceeded a record $100 billion. We are making consistent progress in investment, financial, energy and high-tech cooperation.
Importantly, ties between the regions of Russia and China are expanding. The current cross years of interregional cooperation will give an additional boost to these efforts.
We are paying significant attention to expanding people-to-people exchanges. Many projects have been carried out under the cross years. And, of course, “people’s diplomacy,” direct contacts between our citizens, young people, play a big role in strengthening the foundation of bilateral relations.
I am convinced that the potential of the Russia-China partnership is truly inexhaustible. Naturally, the forthcoming celebration of the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations will further reveal this potential and deepen our friendly, mutually beneficial dialogue in all areas.
Question: China and Russia are two major modern powers. In what way, do you think, can Beijing and Moscow do more to exert a positive influence in order to overcome acute international challenges and maintain an equitable and fair world order?
Vladimir Putin: Russia-China foreign policy interaction is an important stabilising factor in international affairs, all the more so as our countries have overlapping or very close positions on the key issues of our time.
Unfortunately, some Western countries are claiming sole global leadership. They carelessly trample on the norms and principles of international law, resort to blackmail, sanctions and pressure, and try to force their values and dubious ideals on entire countries and populations.
We are categorically opposed to such approaches. In order to improve the international situation and to form a more equitable and democratic global architecture, we will continue to closely coordinate Russia and China’s steps on important global and regional issues, and productively cooperate at leading multilateral venues such as the UN, G20, SCO, BRICS and APEC. At the same time, we remain open to cooperation and joint work with like-minded people, including everyone who is interested in promoting state-to-state communication on the unshakable foundation of the UN Charter and international law.
Question: The greatest number of tourists come to Russia from China. In addition to Moscow and St Petersburg, what other interesting destinations would you recommend that Chinese tourists see?
Vladimir Putin: Indeed, Chinese tourists are clearly in the lead among foreign tourists coming to Russia. Over the past five years, their number has almost doubled, increasing by 93 percent. Last year alone, about 1,700,000 Chinese tourists visited our country. It is our sincere pleasure to have them as guests.
Moscow and St Petersburg remain Chinese tourists’ favourite destinations. However, they want to see other Russian regions as well, including the famous Golden Ring in central Russia, the Urals and Siberia, the Russian Far East and the Caucasus. For example, more and more guests from China are going to Sochi, which, following the successful 2014 Winter Olympics, now boasts high-quality resort and sports infrastructure.
Russia is home to 29 sites included on UNESCO’s World Heritage Site list. This number puts Russia in the top 10 countries in the world. These sites include the cultural and historical ensembles of Novgorod, Sergiyev Posad, Kazan, Yaroslavl, Derbent, the white stone temples of Vladimir and Suzdal, Sviyazhsk, Kizhi Pogost, the Solovki historical and cultural complex and other works by our architects.
Nature has generously endowed Russia with gems such as the world’s deepest and cleanest lake, Baikal, the volcanoes and geysers of Kamchatka, the Golden Mountains of Altai, the forests of the Komi Republic, the Curonian Spit, Central Sikhote-Alin, the nature of Wrangel Island, the Lena River Pillars and the Putorana Plateau.
Visiting memorable sites connected with the history of the revolutionary movement and the lives of Soviet party and state leaders is another area of interest for Chinese tourists.
A region unlike any other, Crimea deserves special mention. In recent years, the tourism industry has been rapidly expanding on the peninsula. Extensive infrastructure is being created and new modern hotels and resorts are being built. All this, combined with the unfailing cordiality and hospitality of the locals, creates excellent opportunities for exciting and rewarding trips.
I will say it again for emphasis: we have plenty of places to see and enjoy, and I want to say once again to all our guests from the friendly nation of China – welcome to Russia!

Beginning of Russian-North Korean talks in expanded format
April 25, 2019
09:10
Russky Island, Vladivostok
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade Chairman, colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you to Russia once again.
We have just had a thorough one-on-one conversation. We were able to discuss the history of our interstate relations, the current situation and prospects for developing bilateral ties.
Naturally, we also talked about the situation in the Korean Peninsula. We exchanged opinions on what should be done, and how, to create favourable prospects for improving this situation.
I would like to thank Mr Chairman for accepting our invitation and for coming to Russia.
Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un (retranslated): Mr President, I am very happy to meet with you and with our Russian friends.
I would like to once again sincerely thank you for flying thousands of kilometres from Moscow and for giving us the time needed to conduct a detailed discussion of various matters.
This time, we have visited our great friendly neighbour with tremendous joy. And I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to convey warm greetings to the President and our dear Russian friends on behalf of our state, government and people.
I came to Russia to exchange opinions on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula, which is among the most topical items of the current international agenda, and also to discuss methods for peacefully resolving this matter and exchange opinions on ways to develop our bilateral relations in line with the new century’s demands.
Mr President, we have just had a very detailed one-on-one exchange of opinions on matters of common interest and on all topical issues.
Thank you for a wonderful time, and I hope that our talks will continue in the same spirit and in a useful and constructive context.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Opening remarks at the meeting on wildfires in Trans-Baikal Territory and overcoming their consequences
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
We gather here in Chita today for this brief, albeit extremely important, meeting to discuss issues related to dealing with the consequences of wildfires in Trans-Baikal Territory.
The situation in the Far Eastern Federal District in terms of wildfires has been challenging since early spring. As you all know, 17 localities in 13 municipal districts suffered from wildfires last week due to high temperatures and strong wind. Both residential and non-residential buildings were damaged.
As the Governor and I have just discussed, fortunately there were no human casualties, and overall the response was quite effective compared to emergencies of this kind over the past years.
This is far from the first time that we have faced a situation of this kind in the Far Eastern, Siberian and a number of other federal districts. Therefore, we understand what needs to be done. Damage from the wildfires must be dealt with swiftly and effectively.
As we all know and understand, our primary task is to help people is the affected areas. It has always been the case, and I hope that this time will not be an exception. We need to outline a plan of concrete actions to restore housing and fulfil this plan without delay before it gets cold.
The Governor and I had a conversation just now, and he said that this detailed plan will be ready by May 10. After that, we will have another meeting in Moscow, and I want you to report to me on this plan. I will come here around September to see how the plan is being implemented.
Today, I would like to hear from you what steps will be taken to deliver on this objective, and how much funding you expect to receive for this purpose. What kind of assistance do you need from federal agencies?
We also need to address the issue of lost documents without delay, as we always do in such cases.
In addition, people who suffered losses in the wildfires must receive all the compensation they are entitled to by law.
Of course, I ask you to assist the farmers who were affected in this emergency. As far as I know, efforts are already underway to reissue documents that were lost and pay out compensations. I want to hear a report on these efforts at this meeting.
I ask the regional leadership to closely monitor the implementation of these and other tasks, and I ask federal agencies and municipal authorities to provide the necessary assistance.
Finally, there is another matter I wanted to raise before concluding my remarks. We are approaching the May holidays, when people clean up their land plots and go out for picnics.
This is not the right time for picnics here, but I do think that we need to do more here and in other regions to raise awareness on fire safety.
When I hear that people are to blame for wildfires of this kind, I cannot agree. Of course, there are people who commit such acts, I understand. But what this shows is that we fail to properly inform the people about the possible consequences. This is my first point in this regard.
Second, some of the wildfires spilled over from across the border, and we must be ready to deal with developments of this kind effectively.
Let us discuss these and other issues. I asked that our colleagues from municipalities be present at this meeting.
Let’s begin by giving them the floor.
