Working meeting with Lev Kuznetsov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kuznetsov, how long have you been working in Krasnoyarsk Territory?
Lev Kuznetsov: That depends on which office we are looking at, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: As the region’s Governor.
Lev Kuznetsov: I’ve been in office as Governor since February 17, 2010, so around 4 years and 4 months in all.
Vladimir Putin: You already know that, acting on the Prime Minister’s proposal, we are establishing a new Ministry for North Caucasus Affairs, for developing the North Caucasus. We are offering you the post of minister.
I know that you have already discussed this matter with the Presidential Executive Office and the Government. I want to thank you for your work as Governor of Krasnoyarsk Territory, and I hope that you will make use of the experience and skills you gained in this high office in Siberia in your new post. 
This Ministry is being established, as was the case with some of our other vitally important regions, to concentrate the federal authorities’ attention on developing the North Caucasus.
I wish you good luck.
Lev Kuznetsov: Thank you, Mr President, for placing this trust in me. I think the experience I gained in Siberia will help me to do an efficient job as minister responsible for the North Caucasus development.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
