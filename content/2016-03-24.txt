President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, colleagues, friends,
It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Moscow.
We consider it very important that we have developed such good relations, which we continuously maintain at the top level and promote.
Regrettably, our trade has decreased for certain reasons, but our Intergovernmental Commission focuses on four major areas, and I hope that our colleagues will make a positive contribution to our cooperation.
Naturally, investment cooperation is extremely important. I know that specific plans already exist, and we will, of course, welcome and support them. It goes without saying that we think your visit is very well timed, considering the need to discuss regional developments.
We are very glad to see our friends in Moscow. Welcome!
Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed Al Nahyan (retranslated): Mr President, I am very happy to be in Moscow today.
Indeed, as you said, trade has fallen, but that is why we came to Moscow. We are in Moscow because Moscow plays a serious role in the Middle East.
We attach great importance to continuous dialogue both on the further development of our bilateral relations and on the ways of enhancing stability in the Middle East.
We strongly believe in the development of our relations and are striving to make them a firm foundation for our future cooperation.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to meet today.
