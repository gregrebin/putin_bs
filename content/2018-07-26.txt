Meeting with President of Angola Joao Lourenco.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, friends,
I am very happy to see you and very pleased to meet with you, Mr President.
Russia and Angola have longstanding and friendly relations that we greatly treasure. We are actively cooperating in political matters, security, and at international organisations.
We thank you, Mr President, for supporting Russian initiatives at the United Nations Organisation.
Our trade is quite modest so far, but in general, we have good projects that can be implemented. Our military and technical cooperation is also developing.
I am very glad we have an opportunity to discuss all these matters with you.
President of Angola Joao Lourenco (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to introduce the members of my delegation. (Introductions follow.)
Mr President, please let me congratulate you on the high level at which the recent FIFA World Cup was held in Russia, personally and on behalf of the Angolan people. I believe this is the best answer to everyone who wanted to sabotage the games, which, in fact, are a symbol of friendship between our peoples, the purpose of which is to strengthen relations between countries.
Mr President, we are interested in strengthening the friendship and cooperation of Russia and Angola, the relations that bind our countries. It should be noted that the relationship goes back a long way, beginning in the Soviet era. During the Cold War, Russia always supported the Angolan people and helped us achieve what we now treasure most of all: our independence.
Back then, many saw us as terrorists and you were one of the few who saw us as people who had the right to fight for their independence.
Even after we won our independence, which we have been enjoying for 42 years, Russia never turned its back on Angola; it always supported us and helped us fight the apartheid regime, which was a threat to Angola and the entire African continent.
Rest assured that the people of Angola will never forget the friendship between our countries that was forged in battle.
We also know that some Russian citizens lost their lives fighting for Angola’s independence. But there has been sustainable peace in Angola for 16 years, and now our agenda has changed. It is different from the one we had before. Now we are focused on development. We want our country to develop in all areas.
Speaking about economic cooperation, we are counting on interaction with Russia. First of all, Russian enterprises work in our mining complex. But we would also like Russian businesses to be represented in other industries.

With Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends,
I am delighted to be meeting with you once again today.
I remember your visit to Sochi in May this year, when we had very good, friendly and substantive talks.
I am now preparing for my upcoming visit to India in October this year. It should be said that our efforts have not been in vain. Our trade is growing. It increased by 24 percent last year and by 26 percent in the first five months of 2018.
I am happy to see you.
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi (retranslated): Your Excellency, I am happy to be able to meet with you once again.
I have warm recollections of my visit to Sochi. The fact that we were together all the time shows that our friendship is growing ever stronger. I am glad to have this opportunity to meet with you again.
Your Excellency, Russia has always been a sporting nation, but the way it held the World Cup has shown the world that it also has brilliant management abilities. The world could see how successfully Russia held this championship, which has strengthened Russia’s image throughout the world.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

With President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends.
I am very pleased to see you here on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit, Mr President. I have already congratulated you on your domestic political victories and would like to do so again.
Our bilateral relations are on the rise, it is clear. This includes the efforts to overcome crises, and I am primarily referring to the Syrian crisis, and the economy to which we are always paying closer attention. Last year our trade increased by 40.5 percent to over $22 billion. In the first five months of this year it increased by another 46 percent. We are carrying out all of our major projects according to plan.
I am very glad to see you and to confirm that we are on the same page with respect to our cooperation.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan
(retranslated): My dear friend,
I would like to express gratitude and satisfaction on behalf of our delegation and from me personally over our meeting today on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit. We agreed to meet here by telephone before the summit.
Relations between our countries – Turkey and Russia – are developing very quickly across the board – in the military, trade, cultural and tourism areas.
Our countries have set targets for trade, and I think we will reach them because we wholeheartedly believe in it.
Our tourism sector is doing well. I think that this year about 6 million Russian tourists will visit our country.
However, on the other hand we are seeing that our cooperation is causing envy from others.
(Speaks in Russian.) Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: You promised to invite me out to a restaurant.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan: I am inviting you.
Vladimir Putin: Yes, but we agreed that we would go when you give our meat products access to your market, when restaurants make meals with Russian meat.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan: I will be looking forward to your arrival.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Meeting with President of Argentina Mauricio Macri
Vladimir Putin and President of Argentina Mauricio Macri discussed prospects for bilateral cooperation, including in the modernisation of the railway industry in Argentina.

With President of Argentine Republic Mauricio Macri.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very glad to see you again.
It is unfortunate that you could not visit us for the World Cup, but we did our best to ensure a comfortable stay for your team and for the Argentinian fans as well: a lot of fans came from Argentina. I think you should not be very upset, because you lost to France, which became the world champion.
I am very glad that you have the opportunity to come here and talk with your colleagues on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit. We also wish Argentina good luck in hosting the G20 summit next autumn.
Our bilateral relations are developing successfully; trade is growing, and our economic agents are exploring various options for expanding our cooperation.
I am very glad to have the opportunity to discuss all these matters with you.
President of Argentina Mauricio Macri
(retranslated): Thank you for seeing me again.
I would like to congratulate you on the excellent organisation of the World Cup and on the excellent performance of your national team. The Russian team has shown that it can really fight, even though the predictions had been completely different.
Unfortunately, I could not visit because of the situation in Argentina, although I would have liked to attend at least one match. It was really a success, and a celebration for the whole world.
I would like to say once again that Russia is a key player in the international arena and a most important partner for Argentina. As I said, there has been progress on what we agreed in January. The first of the Russian investments are starting to make their way to Argentina. Transmashholding has started working on one of the railway enterprises located in the small town of Mechita, which is drawing in almost the entire population there.
A Russian company has also won the first tender for the maintenance and repair of rolling stock. This means that your investments in Argentina will increase and your companies will become more actively involved in our railway sector, where we have ambitious plans.
We will soon announce more tenders for very interesting public-private projects.

Meeting with President of Zambia Edgar Lungu

With President of Zambia Edgar Lungu.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues and friends,
We are delighted to see you and to have this opportunity to hold a short meeting with you on the sidelines of this major international forum.
First of all, I would like to say that we are strengthening the coordination of our foreign policy efforts on the international stage, and that we are grateful to you for supporting Russian initiatives at international platforms, including the UN.
We are also developing relations between our parliaments. The speaker of Zambia’s National Assembly recently visited Russia. I am also pleased to say that our executive offices are developing ties as well.
Our professionals discuss the possibility of cooperation in high-tech sectors, such as medicine and, more specifically, the fight against cancer.
We established diplomatic relations long ago, and the time has come to shift the focus to cooperation in the economy.
President of Zambia Edgar Lungu: Thank you very much, Mr President. I am very delighted to have this opportunity to meet you. It is a busy day for you, but you find time to meet us.
It is an exciting occasion for us because the ministers and our technocrats have been engaging with Russian counterparts in trying to see how they can scale up our cooperation.
Russia was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with Zambia. But over the years this relationship has gone cold, so to speak, not much has been done.
We appreciate the historical role Russia played in liberating West African countries. Zambia particularly benefited from bilateral cooperation when it hosted most of the liberation movements.
We feel now the time has come for us to try to cement the existing relations beyond the point of what has been existing. It is for this reason that I look forward, Your Excellency, to you coming to Zambia one of these days.
There are a lot of various cooperation opportunities, and one of the main of them is energy. We want to use nuclear energy for peaceful means.
We have signed MoUs with ROSATOM and a few other agencies in Russia, so we look forward to your coming to open a ground-breaking, as you said, nuclear centre.

Remarks at an expanded BRICS Summit meeting
July 26, 2018
14:30
Johannesburg
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President Ramaphosa
, Friends, President Xi Jinping
, President Temer
, Prime Minister Modi
, Colleagues,
Meeting in a narrow format, we have just noted – and I would like to recall this now again at the beginning – that during these days we are jointly marking the 100th birth anniversary of South Africa’s outstanding statesman Nelson Mandela. Throughout his life, he was promoting and defending the principles of equality, openness and justice.
I think we really have a right to say that Nelson Mandela’s ideas are reflected in the activities of our association. It is these principles that underlie cooperation between the BRICS
states and it has acquired the nature of a truly strategic partnership.
The BRICS countries have been jointly opposing the strongest challenges and threats to peace and stability. They are cooperating on such matters as the fight against terrorism and extremism, illegal drug trafficking, and trans-border crime.
Let me point out that the association is uniquely positioned in the global economy. This is the world’s biggest market. Its combined GDP has reached 22.3 percent of the world figure and continues to grow.
In the economic sphere, the Five collectively tackle a number of important objectives, such as modernising industry, developing high technology, enhancing competitiveness, and improving living standards.
The South African BRICS Chairmanship has included the above lines in cooperation among its priorities, and these priorities have been taken into account by the BRICS countries in the course of their joint work this year. This work has undoubtedly been a success.
This also concerns the topic suggested for discussion at the current meeting.
The fourth industrial revolution, or digital revolution, now underway is indeed having a great impact on the development of all countries, including the BRICS.
Digitalisation encompasses almost all spheres of society, enables the emergence of new branches of the economy, reduces costs, and significantly increases labour productivity and efficiency. Our countries now need to create comfortable conditions for attracting investment in the advanced branches of the economy, stimulating the development of new technology and its active implementation.
I would like to point out that digitalisation is one of our country’s economic policy priorities. Russia has adopted and is implementing the National Technology Initiative – a package of measures to ensure the country’s technological development until 2035.
We expect that the Digital Economy of the Russian Federation programme we have launched will increase the productivity of labour 30 percent by 2024. New sectors of the Russian economy will contribute more than 10 percent of Russia's GDP.
The digital reality makes it especially important to ensure the safety and security of society, business and citizens. We are taking the necessary legislative measures and making every effort to ensure the development of an open, reliable and secure internet environment with strict observance of guarantees for the protection of personal data and privacy in the digital environment.
We believe that closer partner cooperation between the BRICS countries in building the digital economy will help improve the quality as well as the quantity of our cumulative interaction.
Strengthening trade and investment ties with the BRICS partners is one of Russia’s priorities. At the end of 2017, our trade with the other BRICS members grew by almost 30 percent, exceeding $102 billion.
We are determined to make every effort to further increase trade within the BRICS. We also give priority to matters related to the establishment of direct contacts between entrepreneurs of our countries.
We welcome the new initiatives proposed by the BRICS Business Council, particularly those in electronic commerce, small and medium-sized businesses, as well as the proposal to simplify administrative barriers to stimulate trade exchanges.
We view positively the activities of the Council to implement joint multilateral projects. It is necessary to conduct these activities in close cooperation with the New Development Bank. It is important that the business community should help enhance the Bank’s loan portfolio.
The New Development Bank has considerably expanded its operations as of late. Members of the Board of Directors have approved 21 projects worth over $1 billion, including five that will be implemented in Russia.
We support the idea of opening regional offices of the Bank. Talks are underway with Brazil on this issue. Hopefully, the possibility of opening the Russian office will be discussed after the talks.
The establishment of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement deserves praise, and this has become an important mechanism for the prompt financing of our countries’ banking sector to collect and process economic statistics on Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
In 2017, we met in Xiamen and decided to establish the BRICS Local Currency Bond Fund. This is very important for the development of the financial systems of our states. Therefore, the Fund’s timely initial operations, due to commence in 2019, serve the interests of BRICS.
We are grateful to BRICS partners for supporting the Russian proposal to establish the BRICS Centre of Energy Studies. I am confident that it will be able to offer some tough competition to leading global analytical energy agencies in terms of its high-quality surveys and forecasts.
I would also like to draw the colleagues’ attention to the Russian bid for holding the EXPO 2025 exhibition in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. There are no Brazilian, Indian, Chinese and South African cities among our rivals. Dear friends, we are counting very much on the support of the BRICS countries.
In conclusion, I would like to thank our South African friends and President of South Africa Mr Cyril Ramaphosa for their substantial contribution to expanding practical intra-BRICS cooperation.
And, of course, I am grateful to the colleagues for taking note of our proposal to expand cultural and humanitarian cooperation, especially in the area of sport and the film industry and, maybe, in other areas.
Thank you very much.
