With Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Medvedev, we are closely following economic developments and know that the national currency has become somewhat stronger.
The ruble is growing stronger despite certain price volatility on commodity markets. In this context, of course, we must think about what we should do and how we should do it in connection with this factor.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev
: Mr President, we have a plan for this year and we are carrying it out. It provides for support of the real economy, small and medium-sized businesses, which is very important for this class of entrepreneurs, and non-resource exports, which is also vital in the current situation.
Incidentally, these non-resource exports are affecting our revenues to a much bigger extent. In other words, the share of revenue from these exports has considerably grown in the past few years. This is linked both with the dynamics of oil prices and the increased supply of manufactured goods that we are exporting abroad.
Vladimir Putin: The Government is starting active work on the budget. We are returning to three-year planning. I hope all the factors will be taken into account in the near and mid-term perspective.
Dmitry Medvedev: Absolutely. We have already started working on the budgets for 2017, 2018 and 2019, and indeed, are returning to three-year forecasting, which gives us a wider planning horizon. And, certainly, we will conduct a series of meetings to consider all the factors that exist in the economy today.
I will conduct such meetings in Moscow today and tomorrow and in the next two weeks.

Meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Talent and Success Foundation.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends and colleagues,
Today we will review the performance of the Talent and Success Educational Foundation and the Sirius educational centre for gifted children, which opened at the Foundation a year ago.
I have visited nearly all sites of the Sirius centre, and I hope you did so too, looking at what goes on there, talking with the children and learning about their projects. Personally, I have a very positive impression, and I hope that so do you.
If you have any ideas or proposals, this is what we have met here for – to discuss the centre’s performance and to adjust it, if necessary. In my opinion, the centre has been operating mostly in keeping with our ideas and plans. It offers education for children who are gifted in natural sciences, the arts and sports.
The centre has had 13 sessions, which over 6,600 children attended from all Russian regions, and that is very important. The Talent and Success Educational Foundation recruits the best teachers, researchers, coaches and tutors and offers opportunities for deep involvement in the arts and sports.
During the past year, 154 teachers and 400 university professors who are the leading specialists in their field worked with children at the centre. At the end of each session, 600 children return to their homes not only with new knowledge and skills, but also with the experience of working in a team that is focused on development and top results.

We hope that this drive for results will continue, and that the majority of children will take it back to their schools. In my view, we can say that this is happening already now. In the first year of its operation, the Sirius centre won the respect of the teaching community, students and parents.
The centre’s success was noted by managers of some major companies, research institutions and creative associations. Just before this concert, I had a meeting with the trustees, including the managers of Russia’s largest companies. Some of them are already involved in the centre’s activity one way or another while the others are starting to get involved. They will be advancing their proposals and ideas for the centre’s development. This is what we talked about today.
Now, it is very important that locally, there are more initiatives to establish more educational centres for children. Maybe not as ambitious as Sirius, but schools should devote more attention to children’s personal potential fulfilment. For this purpose, Sirius offers professional development courses for school teachers. This year, over 1,300 teachers have completed internships and professional courses.
At the moment, Sirius is in the middle of its project session. We reviewed what is happening here. The session is for children passionate about science, design and creative engineering. The idea to hold the session was a response to children’s aspiration to apply theoretical knowledge in maths, physics, chemistry and biology and use it to solve hands-on technology and inter-disciplinary tasks.
Participants are presenting their ideas, designs and prototype models, and the results we have seen today are impressive. Of course, there is still a lot to be done in order to equip these classes with modern educational tools, materials and other resources that will allow the kids to carry out their most daring plans.
This is just one example of how Sirius is expanding the horizon of experience and creativity and offering opportunities to talented children. These projects would not be possible without the support of the powerful people with strategic thinking and love for their country and its future. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the teachers, coaches and partners of the Sirius centre and everybody who helps realise its most ambitious plans.
You are all aware of the tough global competition for intellectual resources. We must not lose a single gifted child. We must prioritise the efforts to identify them and help them through life, at least the part of their lives that is concerned with receiving an education and professional skills.
It is one of the main objectives of the Foundation, which stays in contact with the Sirius centre’s “graduates” and monitors their further achievements. We also hope that the Foundation will develop into a federal methodological centre for the regions and will compile a special database for monitoring the development trajectory of each gifted child.

This year the Foundation started issuing Presidential grants for gifted students at our universities. Therefore, it is keeping track not only of the Sirius centre’s graduates, but also other school and university students who have shown their worth, the best of the best.
You may know that I signed an executive order to this effect last year, under which monthly 20,000-ruble grants are issued to each of these students. We have signed 450 contracts on issuing these grants, the recipients of which have pledged to work in Russia upon graduation.
Interest in the Sirius centre will provoke more proposals on expanding its areas of operation. As you remember, initially the centre focused on the areas where Russia traditionally holds the leading positions – physics, mathematics, music, ballet, figure skating and ice hockey. New areas were added over the past year – painting, chemistry and biology. The immediate plans include adding courses on creative writing and information science.
The Foundation’s infrastructure is still under development. The Sirius centre children have modern laboratories, engineering workshops and sites for staging experiments. The centre can invite leading experts to organise professional programmes in the areas of its activity.
We managed to create a unique platform for educating gifted children and fostering their creative endeavours. Our next task is not to let up but to move forward. Let us talk about this in more detail today.

Meeting with donors to the Talent and Success Foundation
Vladimir Putin met with organisers, trustees and donors of the Talent and Success Foundation as part of his visit to the Sirius educational centre for gifted children.

Sochi
Sirius is housed in the former Media Centre of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. It is designed to give young people an opportunity to test their skills and learn about achievements in science, technology, and art.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, good afternoon.
Today, the organisers, trustees, and donors of the Talent and Success Foundation will take a quiz of sorts. We created this foundation almost a year ago and made some of the Olympic facilities available to this new educational centre, which we named “Sirius,” the brightest star in our sky after the Sun.
We intended for this institution to be a centre for gifted children and talented teenagers. I think that you – as people who have achieved success in various industries, businesses and science – understand perfectly well how important this centre is for our country.
I would like to thank you for not remaining on the sidelines, but instead taking part in this major, interesting undertaking, which is critical to our people, to Russian families, children, and teenagers, and, I hope, to your enterprises and the economy in general.

I would like to draw your attention to the plans that the head of the centre just shared with us. Most likely, you are already aware of them. It’s about creating a park for scientific research and the arts. In addition to what you are already doing, which is extremely important for implementing this ambitious project, I would still like to ask you to make sure that this park has modern equipment.
I would like to bring up an issue which we are constantly discussing in a variety of formats, namely, the fact that training and practical experience should go hand in hand. I am aware of your criticism that our schools, including schools of higher vocational training, do not always produce employees that are up to standards.
Here we have a unique opportunity to work directly with young people and have your employees provide them with training. Whenever possible – though not to the detriment of actual production – this park should have modern equipment so that the young people could improve their skills and expertise.
I would really like to have this centre not only provide moral support to talented children, but also create a system to support them from school to university and on until they join the workforce – your workforce, actually.
I would very much like to see our talented youth have an opportunity to make it in Russia. We must accomplish this not by imposing administrative constraints, but by creating the best conditions for them to capitalise on their talents.
That is why this centre was created. I think you will agree with me that this is a noble and exciting goal. I think that you personally, and the people who work alongside you to develop your production facilities, will be interested in visiting this centre.
In any case, it’s interesting to be here. I talked with many outstanding teachers and researchers. It’s fun for them to be around young people and teenagers, share their knowledge, listen to their thoughts and goals which they consider important and how they plan to achieve them.
This is critical for all of us as people who want to reach our full potential. I am aware that each of you has achieved great success, and, in this sense, everyone here has reached their potential, but this is not enough. In order to fully reach your potential, you have to work with young people in a way that is effective and has tangible results.

Sirius provides such an opportunity to each of us, not just the people sitting here, but also many of our colleagues who are not here today. I am referring to the fact that, by design, Sirius should become not only an exclusive centre for training talented youth, but also be a centre for creating an entire system of such institutions across Russia, in fact, at your enterprises and institutions.
I would like to ask you to look at what can be done in the regions. Of course, we will try to push the governors to link up with manufacturing enterprises and businesses and create something similar to Sirius in their respective regions. Perhaps something not as large as Sirius, but directly related to it. In turn, Sirius could develop the methodology for such work nationwide.
That's all I wanted to say in my opening remarks. I want to cordially thank you for your contribution to the development of this remarkable venture, if I may call it that.

Vladimir Putin: Here’s how this idea came about. In the Soviet Union, we had a network of physics and mathematics schools, then biology schools, music schools, art schools, and ballet schools. We have always been proud of our achievements in certain sports.
Since the Winter Olympics were held here, I referred to ice hockey and figure skating. Where did we start? We started with focusing on the physics and mathematics schools, and chemistry schools. We began our selection process there, keeping in mind that this system is already up and running.
With regard to music, secondary schools were set up at almost all leading conservatories back in the Soviet Union, which were used to do the initial screening for talented children. No one gets to such schools without earning it. First, there is the selection of eligible students. Children go to such secondary schools at conservatories with regular curriculum plus in-depth music lessons. The same is true of the physics and mathematics schools. This is where we added another layer to the selection process.
With regard to sports, children who stand out in, say, figure skating or ice hockey get invited there. There are eight skating rinks right here in the Imereti Valley. At some point, there were suggestions to invest and build something new in their place. Why, when we can use them for promoting youth sport?
In fact, this is how it all began. Later, we decided to expand this programme by adding biology, fully aware of the current and future importance of biology, in the broadest sense of the word, for the entire world. I'm not even talking about the economy.
We started inviting students from biological schools, all the more so since a network of specialised educational institutions with emphasis on biology was established in the past few years. We also started inviting students from schools specialising in literature, the Russian language and creative fields, as well as art schools – we have long had a network of them throughout the country.
The initial response was very positive. This is an outstanding institution that is different from others and hopefully, God willing, will stay different with your help. Such famous children’s recreation centres as Ocean in the Far East, Orlyonok on the Black Sea Coast or Artek in Crimea are good and necessary places for children’s recreation and development.
However, this centre has a special mission. Let me emphasise again that it is designed to work with gifted children, enrol more of them, and guide them to university and onward to employment.
It has 154 highly qualified teachers. During a year 400 academics, professors and doctors of science are permanently present here to conduct seminars and classes for children. This is not just a place for recreation but an educational centre.
I said I hope very much that those who went through the Sirius centre and then a university will find their place in life in this country, at your enterprises, and I meant it. However, this project cannot succeed with government assistance alone, that is, without your support and not only financial (I am very grateful to you for it and I know that many of you donate) but also your administrative support, without your intellectual engagement and monitoring of local programmes.
This is exactly why I wanted you to visit this centre and see everything with your own eyes. I’d like you to remember it and think how we can develop this project together.
