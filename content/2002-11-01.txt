The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, dear colleagues,
Permit me to welcome you cordially. We know, Mr Prime Minister, what your position is on the development of the relations between Luxemburg and Russia and also the European Union and Russia. We are glad to welcome to Moscow a European political leader who consistently comes out for their development on the whole range of issues.
I know that you have discussed in detail all the aspects of economic cooperation with the Government of the Russian Federation. Still I hope that we will be able to touch on some of the key issues.
From my data, Luxemburg in 2000 invested about 10.5 billion euros, while its total accumulated investments in Russia stands at less than half a billion dollars. But we have very good interaction at the political level in this area as we have much common ground on international issues. To name but one which is the most important and currently topical today, our positions on Iraq are very similar.
And of course there is the whole range of issues connected with the development of the relations between Russia and the EU. I would like to discuss with you the problem of Kaliningrad, but not only that. There are many issues that claim the attention of both sides.
To conclude my opening remarks, I would like to cordially thank you for the condolences and gestures in support of Russia in the tragic days when terrorists attacked our civilians. At such moments and hours and on such days international solidarity is extremely important.
