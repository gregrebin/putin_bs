President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Colleagues,
Today, as customary at these regular meetings of the Security Council’s permanent members, we will discuss current issues.
Many different events have taken place of late, domestic and international. I will share with you my impressions from the meetings I had in Kyrgyzstan during the informal CSTO summit. The Prime Minister has been working on energy projects, and in this area too there are many interesting results, which we will also discuss.
Finally, tomorrow marks a special anniversary – the first anniversary of the start of Georgia’s invasion of South Ossetian territory. We will discuss the lessons we have learned since then, and the consequences this conflict has had for the situation in the Caucasus and in the world in general.
This is our agenda today. I propose that we start work. Thank you.
