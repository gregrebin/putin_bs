That said, Bulgarian exports to Russia look very good, as I pointed out to our colleagues during the wide-ranging negotiations today. Machinery and equipment make up more than 30 percent, and winemaking products 22 percent.
Of course improving the export structure is one of our key objectives. We believe that our joint efforts should be focused on promoting major bilateral projects. In this context. I would stress in particular the importance of the agreements signed today aimed at the practical implementation of the gas transportation construction project Southern Stream, the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline and the Belene nuclear power station.
Let me point out to the press and the public in our countries that we have set aside 3.8 billion euros in the Russian Federation budget for the implementation of plans to construct a nuclear power station in Belene. Should it be required, we are prepared to extend credit to the Bulgarian side.
We are confident that the successful implementation of all these projects will bring not only tangible economic dividends, but greatly enhance energy security in the Balkans, Europe in general and of course Bulgaria. Carrying out projects in the energy sector of Bulgaria has indisputably become one of the key links in the European energy chain.
There are good prospects for bilateral cooperation open to us in other sectors of the economy: in the field of transport, tourism, investment cooperation and regional cooperation. There is also room to grow in the area of military-technical cooperation and small and medium businesses.
Russian-Bulgarian relations have traditionally been characterized by the very rich potential of our cultural links. Using this valuable capital to the maximum will facilitate intergovernmental agreements in the fields of culture, education and science.
In general, I would like to note that the substantial number of agreements signed during this visit constitutes an excellent basis for the sustained development of mutually beneficial relations between Russia and Bulgaria.
We discussed in detail today our cooperation in the international arena and strengthening security in the Black Sea region on a multilateral basis.
In conclusion, I want to thank the Bulgarian leadership, the entire Bulgarian people and the residents of Sofia for a very warm and genial reception.
We feel it and we are grateful to you for it.
Question: Good afternoon! I have a question for both leaders. Today, an agreement was signed concerning the construction of the Southern Stream gas pipeline. How did you come to sign this agreement? What does this agreement mean for Russia, Bulgaria and Europe as a whole?
Vladimir Putin: Expanding transport infrastructure for the supply of energy to Europe is an absolutely vital task. And our European partners have confirmed this. They have a vested interest in this.
I want to stress in particular that the construction of new infrastructure opportunities does not mean the reduction or phasing out of our cooperation with other transit states. Work on the new routes will provide security, enhance stability and create new transportation capacity for increasing amounts of energy supplies to European consumers.
I will say something that everyone in principle knows: there has been a bruising battle among European countries concerning Russiaâ€™s construction of such facilities. The existence of such infrastructure in the territory of another country, of course, increases its political and economic importance for Europe. And, among other things, it supplies revenues for the budget.
I want to thank all of our experts who worked on the preparation of this agreement. Today we created a special-purpose joint structure between Gazprom and Eni for the Southern Stream gas pipeline system and the construction of its marine component.
We understand that this is a major international project, and we will do everything to ensure that it is successfully implemented. For Russia, this of course means an increase in our capacity for the direct delivery of our products to consumers in major European countries.
President Georgi Parvanov: Let me add a few words of my own. It should be noted that each of these projects has a large economic and social dimension. I would also draw your attention to the issue of security. The project will greatly contribute to the security of the Balkans and of all European countries, especially our neighbours.
We greatly appreciate the position of the Russian side, which agreed with the Bulgarian proposal in connection with the ownership of the pipeline on Bulgarian territory. I personally believe that this decision will meet with public approval in our country. And the signing of the agreement between Gazprom and the Italian company Eni shows how fast the project is moving.
Question: Mr Parvanov, will you will be able to succeed in pleasing your European partners and the Bulgarian public? And a question for the Russian side: Mr President, will you be able to convince other countries that the Southern Stream pipeline will not get bogged down on Bulgarian territory?
Vladimir Putin: We do not need to convince anyone of this. We are asked about it every day, especially during the autumn and the winter. All of our core consumers have problems with deliveries.
