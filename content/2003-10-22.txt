Question: The visit to Thailand has not finished yet, but could you give a preliminary summary of it?
Vladimir Putin: The visit, indeed, has not finished yet, but the business part finished yesterday. We decided to combine it with events within the framework of the APEC summit, which was held in Thailand this year. The visit has been very interesting. We talked about possible ways to develop relations between our countries, above all in the economic sphere. Thailand showed an interest in a number of areas of cooperation. We are very pleased about this, and we are certain that will be able to develop our relations positively.
This concerns the traditional spheres of cooperation, as well as interaction in technical areas, where difficulties have arisen recently. I am referring to the limitations on deliveries of Russian metal production to Thailand. We have also agreed to cooperate in several areas, and agreed on military and technical cooperation. There are good prospects, and I hope it will be possible to consolidate them.
