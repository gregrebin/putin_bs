President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, I sincerely welcome you. I am happy for this opportunity to meet you in person, Mr Prime Minister.
Relations between our nations are developing progressively and are generally on an upswing. At the same time, I must note that the volume of trade exchanges and economic ties is still far from meeting our potential. I am very happy for the chance to meet with you and discuss this issue today.
I am ready to discuss other issues with you as well, including strategic issues – not just in strengthening relations at the state level, but also relations between our civil societies, between ordinary citizens in our nations.
We would be very happy to see you in Russia, Mr Prime Minister.
Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihiko Noda (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. I am also happy to be here with you, to meet you and to talk with you. I congratulate you again on taking office as President. As the heads of two states — Japan and Russia – we believe in a common responsibility for ensuring security and the prosperity of our people and our region.
We also share a common passion – judo – and in this sense, I am very happy to see you. In honour of our meeting today, I have prepared a judogi – the traditional uniform of Japan’s Olympic team – and a portrait of the great teacher Jigoro Kano, which I would like to give to you later.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Arigato.
