President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, I sincerely welcome you. I am happy for this opportunity to meet you in person, Mr Prime Minister.
Relations between our nations are developing progressively and are generally on an upswing. At the same time, I must note that the volume of trade exchanges and economic ties is still far from meeting our potential. I am very happy for the chance to meet with you and discuss this issue today.
I am ready to discuss other issues with you as well, including strategic issues – not just in strengthening relations at the state level, but also relations between our civil societies, between ordinary citizens in our nations.
We would be very happy to see you in Russia, Mr Prime Minister.
Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihiko Noda (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. I am also happy to be here with you, to meet you and to talk with you. I congratulate you again on taking office as President. As the heads of two states — Japan and Russia – we believe in a common responsibility for ensuring security and the prosperity of our people and our region.
We also share a common passion – judo – and in this sense, I am very happy to see you. In honour of our meeting today, I have prepared a judogi – the traditional uniform of Japan’s Olympic team – and a portrait of the great teacher Jigoro Kano, which I would like to give to you later.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Arigato.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with you. Fortunately, we do not have any problems since we spot any emerging issues in good time and resolve them quickly; our relations are developing very dynamically and steadily. Naturally, there is a lot of work, there are always on-going issues that need to be addressed. But most importantly, we have learned to do it openly, as friends.
I will not list all the areas of our cooperation since there are so many of them. I am confident that we will continue to expand the palette of our relationship.
Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan
(retranslated): I am also very pleased to meet with you. We had a meeting in St Petersburg, but it is very good that we have used this opportunity to meet again here. From here I will be travelling to Rio de Janeiro, where I will take part in the Rio+20 summit. I would also very much like to attend the St Petersburg summit.
It will be good if we can discuss regional cooperation in addition to our bilateral relations.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam President, I am very pleased to meet you on the sidelines of the G20 summit. Russia enjoys excellent, dynamically developing relations with Brazil. There are interesting areas of cooperation in spheres that have great importance for us, such as agriculture and high technology industries. I hope that this trend will continue in the near future.
President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff
(retranslated): I am also very pleased to meet with you, Mr President. I know that during Mr Lula’s presidency [Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva], you established a very strong relationship that is beneficial both for Brazil and for Russia. We sincerely want this relationship to flourish further on a mutually beneficial basis. I think defence cooperation is an important area in which our relations can develop.

With Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron.
A meeting between Vladimir Putin and David Cameron
took place ahead of the G20 summit, where the leaders discussed issues in bilateral relations, including economic matters.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, I recall quite well our meeting in Moscow and I am happy to meet with you on the sidelines of the G20 summit. I would like to note that relations between the UK and Russia are developing quite positively. But naturally, we have things to discuss on the international agenda, as well as our bilateral relations, including economic matters, which certainly require particular attention and administrative support from us.
Prime Minister of The United Kingdom David Cameron: Thank you.
I also remember meeting in Moscow, and I very much enjoyed my visit to your country.
As I’ve said, I want to see strengthened British-Russian relations, and I think that our economic relations are strong, with investments both ways, and I want to see that encouraged. But as you said, there are many international issues we should also discuss, talks that are taking place in Moscow over the future of the Iranian nuclear programme, and also the terrible situation in Syria and the need to seek unity to try and achieve a transition. But it’s good to have this opportunity to strengthen our relations here in Mexico.
