Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
President Vladimir Putin : Mr President!
It is a pleasure to meet with you again, this time because of our work with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
I have to say that relations between our countries are progressing very well. First and foremost, I want to point out the success of the Year of China in the Russian Federation. We are off to a good start on this campaign: by our count some 150 events have already taken place.
Our economic relations are developing steadily. I think that this year we can confidently predict that our trade will exceed 40 billion dollars.
I know that you are concentrating on the development of Russian-Chinese relations in all areas. I want to emphasize that in Russia we have also paid special attention to the development of our bilateral relations. We are all working hard on transforming our relations into ones with strategic importance.
I am confident that our meeting today will benefit our general interests.
President of China Hu Jintao: Dear Mr President!
I fully share your sense of the relations between our countries. This year, relations between China and Russia continue to move forward in all areas. First and foremost, we have increased high level contacts and we are strengthening mutual trust and support.
Secondly, with your active support and that of the Russian government and various business circles, the events associated with the Year of China in Russia have been successful and have already had positive repercussions.
Thirdly, there has been further progress in our practical cooperation in all fields. Trade has increased rapidly. In the first half of this year it was up more than 30 percent. As you have already noted, there is every reason to believe that the full amount of trade for 2007 will exceed 40 billion USD.
It is encouraging to note that trading structures have improved. Russian exports of machinery products to China have maintained their positive dynamic.
The clear progress in our relations is bound up with the increased attention you and the Russian government cabinet have extended to them. It is also linked to the huge support they have had. We are prepared to increase our efforts and, using the agreements that were reached during my visit to Russia in March of this year, join in a general effort to advance our practical cooperation and take the strategic partnership between China and Russia to new heights.

Press Statement Following the Session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of State
August 16, 2007
20:53
Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
Vladimir Putin : Ladies and gentlemen!
First and foremost I want to join in thanking the President of Kyrgyzstan, Kurmanbek Salievich Bakiev, and all our Kyrgyz friends for the warm welcome.
I share my colleagues’ high opinion of the outcome of the SCO summit. Our meeting here in Bishkek has been really productive. And the decisions taken will, I am sure, further strengthen our Organisation.
The main business today has been the signing of the Agreement on Long-Term Neighbourly Relations, Friendship and Cooperation. This document provides a guide for working together in the future. It also creates a good foundation for the comprehensive development of the SCO and for increasing cooperation among members of the Organisation and observer states.
Today we have also signed important agreements concerning the ministries of culture and the SCO financial and economic structures, the Business Council and the Interbank Association. Our approach to regional and international issues is reflected in the Bishkek Declaration.
One of the SCO’s topical challenges remains working together in the fight against terrorism. The way terror currently operates across borders makes it a general threat for our countries and the SCO will deal with it using the mechanisms established by the Organisation. As you know, tomorrow we will participate in the final phase of the SCO anti-terrorist training exercises in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia.
In conclusion, I want to thank my colleagues for their support of the Russian proposal to hold the 2009 session of the SCO Council of Heads of State in the Russian Federation.
I am confident that relations between our countries will continue to develop on the basis of ”Shanghai Spirit“ of cooperation. Our peoples' mutual desire for friendship and partnership will help create and implement new initiatives and projects in the cultural, educational and economic spheres.
Thank you for your attention.
