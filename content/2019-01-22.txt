Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe (retranslated): Mr President, colleagues. I am happy to meet with you here at the beginning of this year as we agreed in Singapore and Buenos Aires.

For our part, we are ready to do all we can to make 2019 a year of the rapid [development of relations] between Japan and Russia.
I am pleased to say that our bilateral cooperation is producing tangible results in eight areas, including Japan-Russia cross years.
Today, I am planning to discuss the issues related to the conclusion of the peace treaty, with due account of the results of the foreign ministers’ meeting and the meeting of the negotiators last week. In addition, I hope for a straight exchange of views on bilateral relations and international issues with a view to developing our ties on a large scale.
