With Head of Coptic Church, Pope Tawadros II and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Holiness, please allow me to welcome you here! The Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia told me in some detail about the Coptic Church and about you.
The Coptic Church is one of the very first Christian churches. There are 30 million Copts in the world, including 14 million in Egypt. I am particularly pleased to note this because we have very good relations with Egypt, of course with all Egyptian people regardless of their religion.
Nonetheless, we are particularly pleased to spend time with you, the person who represents Christianity in Egypt. This is a special connection with Egypt for us.
I know that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
, a great friend of our country, is actively supporting Copts in Egypt. When you have the opportunity, please convey to him and the entire Egyptian nation the best wishes from Russia.
Head of the Coptic Church, Pope Tawadros II (retranslated): Thank you for the time you have accorded me. I have long wanted to meet you.
Two years ago, I was on a visit to Armenia, and this is the second time I am in Russia, meeting with my dear brother His Holiness Patriarch Kirill. This is also especially important for me on the occasion of celebrations in honour of St Nicholas. Also, thank you for the award that was presented to me yesterday.
The relations that connect Russia and Egypt are very good. We are proud of that. I can also say that the relations between our two churches are very good. Our cooperation is developing in various spheres.
I thank God for the fact that the situation in Egypt is improving every day. We have a very good relationship with President Sisi, the Government and Parliament of Egypt. We also make efforts to maintain national unity in Egypt between Christians and Muslims.
The activities conducted within the church are aimed at the only goal: to uphold national unity. Thank you for your hospitality and for your special attitude toward Egypt. We will pray for these relations to get better every day at both the interstate and inter-church level.
Vladimir Putin: We attach great importance to developing relations between churches.
You just mentioned the relics of St Nicholas. This event has become possible thanks to the agreements reached during a meeting between the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia and the Pope. It is a major event for Orthodox believers in Russia. We are very grateful to the Pope and the Holy See for the decision made at the Patriarch’s request.
The church plays a very important role in bringing nations closer together. In your case, this is the most prominent manifestation of a very useful modern trend.

Meeting with Government members.
The meeting participants examined a number of current matters, including wage rises for those categories of public workers not listed in the May 2012 Executive Orders.
In addition, the President heard reports on the organisation of work to implement the decisions of the joint meeting of the State Council and the Commission on Monitoring Targeted Socioeconomic Development Indicators and on the progress in preparing for children’s summer recreation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today, I suggest that we discuss progress in implementing an important part of the May 2012 Executive Orders, namely provisions concerning public sector wages. This is a very important and sensitive matter for many people, for millions of our fellow citizens.
I would like to remind you that the May 2012 Executive Orders set targets in this area and a timetable for reaching them. In 2018, we should reach the targets for wage increases for the categories of public sector employees that people have already dubbed the ‘executive order categories’.
Overall, we are meeting our commitments as planned. Some regions have been experiencing difficulties, however. I therefore hope to hear your proposals today on immediate measures to rectify the situation.
However, what I particularly want to underscore today is that the May 2012 Executive Orders did not cover all public sector employees. Some categories of public sector workers have not had their wages raised for several years now.
In this respect, I propose that we also carry out wage indexation for these categories, the so-called ‘non-executive order categories’, taking into account inflation and what the federal and regional budgets can realistically support.
I ask the Government to draft and present relevant proposals. Please do not delay this work. We must discuss this soon, given that work is actively underway on drafting the 2018 budget.
Turning to current matters, we recently held a joint meeting of the State Council and the Commission for Monitoring Implementation of the May 2012 Executive Orders. This meeting took concrete decisions, and I would like to hear today about how you are organising their implementation.
Let us begin.
