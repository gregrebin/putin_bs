President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, friends,
I am delighted to meet you.
Myanmar is our long-standing and reliable partner in Southeast Asia. I believe that next year we will mark 75 years of our diplomatic relations.
Our relations are developing positively. The volume of our trade and economic ties is still modest in absolute figures, but the trend is very good: it has increased by 140 percent in the first six months of this year.

You visited our country several times in various capacities. This time you have come as Prime Minister of the Caretaker Government and Chairman of the State Administration Council. I know that you have a packed agenda in Russia, which includes a visit to the Vostochny Space Launch Centre.
I would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to the Eastern Economic Forum.
I am very glad to see you. Welcome.
Chairman of the State Administration Council of Myanmar Min Aung Hlaing (retranslated):I am glad to see you too, and I would like to thank you for organising this meeting.
Mr President has pointed out correctly that next year we will mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations, which is a major celebration for us. Of course, since the establishment of diplomatic relations we have seen periods of growth and pauses, but 20 years ago our cooperation started developing intensively, and it continues in the same manner now.
Your country is a great historic power. Almost 30 years ago, you had a difficult period as well, but you have overcome it, and with your assistance the country has been developing intensively, and we can see that growth pace.
I am proud of you that under your leadership Russia has become a number one country in the world, if I may say so. We would like to describe you not as the leader of Russia but the leader of the world, because you are monitoring and masterminding stability in the world.
If I may, I would like to share some information with you.
Vladimir Putin: I will be delighted.
