President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, friends,
I am delighted to meet you.
Myanmar is our long-standing and reliable partner in Southeast Asia. I believe that next year we will mark 75 years of our diplomatic relations.
Our relations are developing positively. The volume of our trade and economic ties is still modest in absolute figures, but the trend is very good: it has increased by 140 percent in the first six months of this year.

You visited our country several times in various capacities. This time you have come as Prime Minister of the Caretaker Government and Chairman of the State Administration Council. I know that you have a packed agenda in Russia, which includes a visit to the Vostochny Space Launch Centre.
I would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to the Eastern Economic Forum.
I am very glad to see you. Welcome.
Chairman of the State Administration Council of Myanmar Min Aung Hlaing (retranslated):I am glad to see you too, and I would like to thank you for organising this meeting.
Mr President has pointed out correctly that next year we will mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations, which is a major celebration for us. Of course, since the establishment of diplomatic relations we have seen periods of growth and pauses, but 20 years ago our cooperation started developing intensively, and it continues in the same manner now.
Your country is a great historic power. Almost 30 years ago, you had a difficult period as well, but you have overcome it, and with your assistance the country has been developing intensively, and we can see that growth pace.
I am proud of you that under your leadership Russia has become a number one country in the world, if I may say so. We would like to describe you not as the leader of Russia but the leader of the world, because you are monitoring and masterminding stability in the world.
If I may, I would like to share some information with you.
Vladimir Putin: I will be delighted.

I am glad to see you, and I would like to thank you once again for taking the time to attend the economic forum in Vladivostok.
Please convey our best regards and wishes to my good friend, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
This is not your first visit to our country, Russia, and we know you very well. We attach great significance to your visit, which is fresh proof of the special nature of Russia-China relations.

I would like to wish all our Chinese friends and all Chinese comrades a successful 20th Congress of the Communist Party of China.
Our strategic partnership is growing very successfully. Our trade is increasing. Last year, it grew considerably, by 36 percent and has reached US$140 billion. It continues to grow and has gone up another 30 percent in the first six months of this year. By all appearances, our trade will soon reach the target goal of US$200 billion.
I know that you have a busy agenda in Russia. Apart from attending the forum here, you will also travel to Moscow, where you will meet with the heads of the two houses of Russia’ Federal Assembly. We set a high value on the development of our interparliamentary ties and on the personal contribution of the heads of houses of our two countries’ parliaments.
Once again, thank you for coming.
Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China Li Zhanshu (retranslated): Mr President,
Thank you for finding the time to meet with me.
First, I want to extend to you the most cordial greetings and the best wishes from your good friend, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
I just learned that you have already sent condolences to him following the earthquake in Sichuan Province. I am grateful to you for this. This shows the deep affection you feel for the Chinese people.
Vladimir Putin: People have died. We offer our deep sympathy to you.
Li Zhanshu: Some 70 people were killed.
I want to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate you on the successful opening of the 7th Eastern Economic Forum. You delivered a remarkable speech that is very useful for us.
Indeed, as of late, under your and President Xi Jinping’s leadership, the comprehensive strategic partnership and interaction between China and Russia have demonstrated a strong upward development trend.

Meeting with Prime Minister of Mongolia Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrain
Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Mongolia Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrain discussed the current state of bilateral relations in trade, the economy, humanitarian and other spheres.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
I am very glad to meet you.
First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting my invitation and for attending the economic forum in Vladivostok.
Our bilateral relations have deep roots and rich history. Last year we marked the 100th anniversary of our diplomatic relations.
Economic ties are developing, and trade is growing. We have major projects, which we are interested in developing, such as the Ulaanbaatar Railway, as well as enterprises extracting mineral resources and metals. Now we are talking about the possible implementation of a major infrastructure project: the supply of Russian gas to China via Mongolia.

Just an hour ago, the Rosneft CEO reported to me that agreements were reached during his working trip to Mongolia on expanding cooperation in this area. As far as I know, you have coordinated all issues related to the supply of oil and oil products.
We have always had extensive cooperation in humanitarian sphere.
We are satisfied with the level and nature of relations that have developed between Russia and Mongolia.
A meeting with the President of Mongolia is planned to be held very soon in Uzbekistan, where we expect to also hold a trilateral summit with the President of China.
I am very glad to see you.
Prime Minister of Mongolia Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene (retranslated): Mr President, I am delighted to meet with you today.
You came to our country on an official visit during celebrations of the 80th anniversary of our common victory in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, and I took part in the meeting of the two presidents.
First of all, please accept our condolences on the loss of two embassy employees in Kabul.
I am very pleased to convey to you the friendliest and warmest greetings from the President of our country.
I hope our future meetings and our meetings during the forum will help us move the gas pipeline construction project forward.
Last summer, in mid-summer, we jointly celebrated the 100th anniversary of the people's revolution in Mongolia and celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Party as well. These centennial anniversaries coincided with the 100th anniversary of Mongolian-Russian diplomatic relations. This 100-year period will be over a month from now, and we will move into the 101st year of relations and cooperation.
In the 100 years of its recent history, our country, first, secured its independence and sovereignty and made progress in its development. A foundation for science and education was built. We launched joint space exploration projects. All of the above is inextricably linked with our history and good relations with the Russian Federation.
The Mongolian people have warm feelings for you, because during your presidency, and your term as Prime Minister, major issues in our relations, such as the final settlement of what is known as the “big debt” in transferable rubles were settled, and major projects were implemented which helped our country move forward.
Now that we are making the transition from the first century of our relations and cooperation to the second century, unfortunately, we are faced with the pandemic and a challenging global geopolitical situation. One hundred years ago we faced similar challenges. Apparently, the cyclical nature of human evolution lies at the heart of such challenges.
In the most difficult times, the Mongolian state and government, as well as the Mongolian people strive to maintain warm relations with our eternal neighbours, primarily, our northern neighbour Russia. Friendly, neighbourly and fraternal relations are not measured by any historical events. They are personal and grounded in the specific nature of our relations.
In July, Russia’s Foreign Minister [Sergei] Lavrov visited Mongolia. During that visit, we had an open and in-depth discussion concerning the future of our bilateral relations and bilateral cooperation. We were satisfied with the outcome of that visit. I believe you were apprised of that information accordingly.
