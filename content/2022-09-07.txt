President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, friends,
I am delighted to meet you.
Myanmar is our long-standing and reliable partner in Southeast Asia. I believe that next year we will mark 75 years of our diplomatic relations.
Our relations are developing positively. The volume of our trade and economic ties is still modest in absolute figures, but the trend is very good: it has increased by 140 percent in the first six months of this year.

You visited our country several times in various capacities. This time you have come as Prime Minister of the Caretaker Government and Chairman of the State Administration Council. I know that you have a packed agenda in Russia, which includes a visit to the Vostochny Space Launch Centre.
I would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to the Eastern Economic Forum.
I am very glad to see you. Welcome.
Chairman of the State Administration Council of Myanmar Min Aung Hlaing (retranslated):I am glad to see you too, and I would like to thank you for organising this meeting.
Mr President has pointed out correctly that next year we will mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations, which is a major celebration for us. Of course, since the establishment of diplomatic relations we have seen periods of growth and pauses, but 20 years ago our cooperation started developing intensively, and it continues in the same manner now.
Your country is a great historic power. Almost 30 years ago, you had a difficult period as well, but you have overcome it, and with your assistance the country has been developing intensively, and we can see that growth pace.
I am proud of you that under your leadership Russia has become a number one country in the world, if I may say so. We would like to describe you not as the leader of Russia but the leader of the world, because you are monitoring and masterminding stability in the world.
If I may, I would like to share some information with you.
Vladimir Putin: I will be delighted.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade Chairman of the Standing Committee,
I am glad to see you, and I would like to thank you once again for taking the time to attend the economic forum in Vladivostok.
Please convey our best regards and wishes to my good friend, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
This is not your first visit to our country, Russia, and we know you very well. We attach great significance to your visit, which is fresh proof of the special nature of Russia-China relations.
I will meet with President Xi Jinping soon, during the events related to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which will be held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.

I would like to wish all our Chinese friends and all Chinese comrades a successful 20th Congress of the Communist Party of China.
Our strategic partnership is growing very successfully. Our trade is increasing. Last year, it grew considerably, by 36 percent and has reached US$140 billion. It continues to grow and has gone up another 30 percent in the first six months of this year. By all appearances, our trade will soon reach the target goal of US$200 billion.
I know that you have a busy agenda in Russia. Apart from attending the forum here, you will also travel to Moscow, where you will meet with the heads of the two houses of Russia’ Federal Assembly. We set a high value on the development of our interparliamentary ties and on the personal contribution of the heads of houses of our two countries’ parliaments.
Once again, thank you for coming.
Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China Li Zhanshu (retranslated): Mr President,
Thank you for finding the time to meet with me.
First, I want to extend to you the most cordial greetings and the best wishes from your good friend, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
I just learned that you have already sent condolences to him following the earthquake in Sichuan Province. I am grateful to you for this. This shows the deep affection you feel for the Chinese people.
Vladimir Putin: People have died. We offer our deep sympathy to you.
Li Zhanshu: Some 70 people were killed.
I want to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate you on the successful opening of the 7th Eastern Economic Forum. You delivered a remarkable speech that is very useful for us.
Indeed, as of late, under your and President Xi Jinping’s leadership, the comprehensive strategic partnership and interaction between China and Russia have demonstrated a strong upward development trend.
