President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kalinin, first of all I would like to congratulate and all of your colleagues on the anniversary of one of the most active organisations supporting small and medium-size entrepreneurship in this country.
Fifteen years have passed and you and your colleagues have done a lot of work in cooperation with the Government of the Russian Federation and the Presidential Executive Office.
You are directly involved in elaborating draft laws, bylaws and other acts that impact business directly or indirectly, primarily small and medium-sized entrepreneurship. I would like to thank you and your colleagues for your active participation in these efforts and for working with us.
I know that you held an anniversary forum quite recently, the other day, where you also discussed specific issues that are of interest to people involved in business. In this context I would like to discuss a couple of issues separately today.
The first issue deals with the introduction of new cash registers that report fiscal information to tax agencies online in real time. I know that some business representatives voiced different ideas and concerns that the transition to the new registers does not take into account the peculiarities of the business conducted by certain small and medium-sized companies. These cash registers are already being introduced, and the next big step is planned for the middle of next year. I believe it will affect almost two million business owners. Let us discuss this issue to see what you think about possible solutions.
And the second important issue (you certainly know this as well) is our decision to make the minimum monthly wage equal to the subsistence level. This is one of the fundamental decisions that, I believe, should ensure that basic human necessities are not out of the reach of the wages that some of our citizens still continue to receive.
But at the same time this decision will have an economic impact on small and medium-sized businesses that must pay the corresponding taxes to social funds. It is necessary to be very careful here so as not to create more problems by solving one and not to create difficulties for small and medium-sized businesses and self-employed people.
I suggest that we discuss these issues and then any other matters that you consider important.
