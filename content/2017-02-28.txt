With President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Mr Putin,
It is a great pleasure and opportunity for me to have this meeting with you and discuss bilateral relations between our countries. As you may be aware, on November 19, 2017 Kyrgyzstan will elect a new president. I am beginning to sum up results, and I am delighted that together we have succeeded in not only putting the relations between Kyrgyzstan and Russia back on track, but also elevating them to a strategic partnership. This is how the relations between two countries with a shared past and, as I strongly believe, with a shared future should be. This is the level of relations two brotherly nations should have.
I am very happy to see you and your delegation. Once again, welcome.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, thank you for your invitation. We meet here in Kyrgyzstan just as we had agreed during our meeting in St Petersburg.
It is true that you have done a great deal to ensure steady progress in our relations, bringing them to a new level. We will have an opportunity to discuss all areas of cooperation during today’s meeting.
Kyrgyzstan remains a very important partner for Russia. The fact that Russia is Kyrgyzstan’s number one trading partner is highly satisfying for all of us. Although trade and economic ties slightly declined in value terms, physical volumes showed positive momentum. Still, we have much to discuss given the scope of the relations between our countries.
Once again, thank you for your invitation. I am confident that today’s meeting will be very fruitful.
