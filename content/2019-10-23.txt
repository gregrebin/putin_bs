Meeting with President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, African Union Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Russia-Africa Summit Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Russia.
At the beginning of our meeting, I would like to thank you for your support during our preparations for the summit’s events that involve the heads of state and government from African states and Russia, and which are scheduled to take place today and tomorrow. We are hosting such a large-scale event for the first time, and your support was vitally important and timely.
As for our bilateral relations, they continue to develop very successfully. In 2018, our trade increased by 14 percent and reached $7.7 billion. We continue to implement ambitious projects that have been coordinated by us, including a nuclear power plant and an industrial zone in Egypt. We are working very actively in these areas, and we are planning to invest $190 million in infrastructure development projects and to attract up to $7 billion.

By the way, I have recently visited our common friends in the United Arab Emirates. They became extremely interested in our joint project and will also think of how to become involved in our joint industrial development plans.
We have many infrastructure and transport projects.
Mr President, we maintain constant personal contacts: this is our third meeting in 2019. Cooperation between our foreign ministries and security services includes a broad range of issues on the international agenda, the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
We are very happy to see you. Welcome.
President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for your hospitality and the warm welcome I have been given in this wonderful city of Sochi.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for holding the first Russia-Africa Summit. Our relations have a long history in many fields and spheres, starting with Russia’s support to the liberation movement in Africa. I would like to say that we are interested in coordinating our efforts with Russia so as to ensure the success of both the summit and the forum. We strongly hope that thanks to the contribution from many African countries we will attain practical results in the interests of all countries and parties based on mutually beneficial cooperation.
I would like to point out that we view Russia as a reliable partner of the African continent. We hope very much that Russia will be working in Africa in all spheres and fields, including in that of the development, as well as in the financing of infrastructure projects on the continent and in particular in energy and road construction.
As for bilateral relations, Mr President, I would like to assure you of our high appreciation of our bilateral relations, which are developing in various formats, especially after we signed a comprehensive cooperation agreement. We sincerely hope that our relations will continue to develop in all fields and spheres.
I would like to speak about the spheres where we will be working together. Speaking about the Russian Industrial Zone, we have a strong interest in accelerating the implementation of this project in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. We also want to settle all the outstanding problems, so that Russian companies and enterprises come to Egypt, register and start working in this zone.
We highly appreciate our bilateral relations in the sphere of railway lines and the manufacturing of train carriages in Egypt. We hope very much that the Russian company concerned will be able to work in Egypt, especially after it has delivered 1,300 carriages to the country.
As for the nuclear power plant, we set a high value on our bilateral cooperation. We strongly hope that all topics related to this project will be settled without delay so that we can start implementing the project in accordance with the signed contract.
Mr President, I would like to invite you to visit Egypt once again so as to be able to attend the ground-breaking ceremony of this vital project and also to attend the signing of the contract on the Russian Industrial Zone in Egypt.
Mr President, we also hope that the Russian side will provide support to nuclear energy facilities in Egypt so that we can work and act in accordance with the approved schedule.
As for military cooperation, we have a strong interest in promoting our cooperation in this sphere, because we know that Russia has been a traditional partner in the field of military technical cooperation for many decades.

Meeting with President of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob
Vladimir Putin met with President of the Republic of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob in Sochi.
October 23, 2019

Sochi
1 of 6
With President of the Republic of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
Welcome to Russia.
To start with, I would like to note that next year we will be marking an important date – the 30th anniversary of independence of Namibia and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.
Over these years, an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust has formed between our countries. We appreciate the Namibian leadership’s position of support of our initiatives at the UN, as well as of Russian candidates at various international organisations.
I would like to point out that our political dialogue is developing, and we can see a positive trend when it comes to trade and economic ties. Trade grew more than seven times last year.
We have good prospects in an entire range of fields. This includes energy. Exploration of mineral resources, in particular, Namibia’s uranium resources, can become an important part of our cooperation. Russia is the fifth largest producer of uranium raw material in the world. Russia, as a world leader in nuclear energy and nuclear fuel production, and Namibia, as a major uranium producer, could establish close cooperation and become good partners.
Such spheres as joint exploration of fields potentially rich in vanadium, copper, gold and other minerals is also quite an interesting area of cooperation. We have a legal basis for this. In 2016, we signed intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in geology and mineral resources as well as a memorandum of understanding between Zarubezhgeologiya and a Namibian company.
We also have potentially interesting offers in the diamond industry. Our largest diamond producer, Alrosa, is ready to host a Namibian delegation in Moscow to discuss matters of mutual interest.

We also have interesting prospects in transport. The United Wagon Company is negotiating with a company from Namibia to upgrade railways and supply freight cars and spare parts; they are also discussing an opportunity for SKD assembly on the spot, in Namibia.
Construction of surface facilities for air travel can also be economically advantageous. Our companies are interested in working together in hydropower engineering.
We are ready to promote cooperation in the field of agriculture, for example, to import Namibian food products, such as meat and fish. We hope to organise counter trading of our animal products to Namibia and to expand our exports of grain and fertilisers.
Mr President, we have a lot of interesting fields when it comes to cooperation. I would like your visit to encourage our economic operators to work more actively.
Thank you very much.
President of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob: Thank you very much for this opportunity.
To us – we are former freedom fighters, who fought against colonialism – Russia has always been there, where our people were oppressed. So those of us from Namibia, SWAPO Party, although its name has changed, it was the Russian people, who were welcoming us, taking care of us, sharing the trenches in Africa. Difficult times for some of them. So I am very honoured to meet you, we are glad to renew now the relationships. During the difficult times we are together. Now it is time when our old friends can come and see how we can cooperate in what we are calling as our second phase of the struggle, that of economic emancipation. So I am glad to say that already our military people instructed me to say they want to have Russian military advisors and so on, to start with.
As for the other many things Your Excellency mentioned. Our bilateral relations are good, but not as good as they could be because of the old relations we had. The areas you’ve mentioned are all important. I was surprised you have mentioned already what I was supposed to mention. Education, we have students who are studying here, doctors, medical doctors.
Energy is the biggest problem and issue that we can discuss. Uranium we have, we don’t use it ourselves. Our friends who can use it, can come and call as law as we said earlier. But before that I must thank you for not leaving our country in a serious trouble, and you came to our aid, so thank you very much. About uranium, yes, we are uranium producing country and we will be welcoming those who would like to come and use it.

Meeting with leaders of African regional organisations
Vladimir Putin and President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, African Union Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Russia-Africa Summit Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took part in a working breakfast with the leaders of African regional organisations.
October 23, 2019

Sochi
2 of 7
Meeting with leaders of African regional organisations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends and colleagues,
President el-Sisi, ladies and gentlemen,
I am delighted to welcome the heads of state and government that now chair the main regional organisations of Africa. I would also like to welcome the heads of their executive bodies.
Those present here include representatives of the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the East African Community (EAC), the Group of Five for the Sahel intergovernmental organisation, and the African Export-Import Bank.
I would like to emphasise that Russia is taking an active part in the regional integration processes on the vast space of Eurasia and is part of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). We consider it important to discuss the prospects of cooperation between the EAEU and the African organisations represented here. Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission Board (EEC) Mr Sargsyan will share his views on this matter.

Incidentally, the EAEU has already established contacts with a number of African countries. Talks are underway on the creation of a free trade zone with Egypt and a memorandum on cooperation was signed with Morocco. Tomorrow the EEC will sign a memorandum with the AU Commission, thereby laying the foundation for multifaceted cooperation between two integration associations.
Naturally, Russia is willing to develop partnership with African regional organisations not only through the EAEU but also on a bilateral basis. I would like to mention in this context a memorandum on the basic principles of relations between Russia and the AU that will be signed here in Sochi. This document will map out guidelines of the major joint projects and initiatives in the political, trade, economic, social and humanitarian fields.
This is just one example of mutually beneficial cooperation. But we are interested in establishing and effectively developing cooperation with other African leading regional organisations too, for instance, the EAC. By the way, taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to wish its Chairman, President of Rwanda Paul Kagame, a very happy birthday! Let’s wish him all the very best. (Applause.) He is celebrating his birthday in our close-knit company but, regrettably, has to work.
In general, we hope that today’s discussions will be beneficial and will create prerequisites for reaching specific agreements on the development of cooperation between Russia and the EAEU and African integration associations.

Meeting with President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera
The President of Russia had a meeting with the President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera.
October 23, 2019

Sochi
1 of 5
Meeting with President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am really delighted to welcome you once again to Russia. In May 2018, we had an extensive meeting on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Today, Mr President, we would like to thank you for being able to take part in the first Russia-Africa Summit.
I know that you have already visited Sochi, and I hope you like it here.
The Central African Republic is Russia’s promising partner on the African continent. As we know, Russia was among the first countries to recognise the independence of your state by establishing diplomatic relations with it. Next year, we will be marking the 60th anniversary of these significant milestones in our interstate history.
Our countries maintain friendly relations. At certain stages, between 150 and 200 specialists from this country worked in your country.
We welcome your desire to expand diverse cooperation with Russia. We realise that, as a national leader, you face the difficult tasks of overcoming the consequences of a protracted military-political and socioeconomic crisis. In turn, we will do our best to support your efforts to stabilise the situation in the country and to strengthen mutually beneficial trade and economic, cultural and humanitarian ties.

Regarding trade and economic relations, we, of course, still have to accomplish a lot here. Good prospects are opening up here, including those in the field of agriculture, energy, industrial equipment supplies, and so on and so forth.
We need to think of how to completely activate the economic potential of our states. I suggest compiling a list of promising joint projects that can be implemented and exchanged. Based on this document, we will be able to look for our economic operators, Russian companies interested in working in your country.
The most important task is to streamline the contractual legal framework and to create favourable conditions for investment and for Russian business operations.
I believe that we will be able to discuss all these matters during our meetings today, including those on the sidelines of the summit and in an informal setting.
Thank you very much.
President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera (retranslated): Mr President, my dear friend, ladies and gentlemen,
First, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for the honour of being invited to the first Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi, accorded to my country and me, and for this meeting which we will use to discuss our cooperation.
I also want to thank you on behalf of the people of the Central African Republic, as well as on behalf of its government, for the excellent quality of our friendly relations and cooperation, which are enriched every day with the specific actions that you take with regard to the Central African Republic.
Russia has provided enormous assistance to the Central African Republic in the military sphere, contributed to training soldiers for the Central African Republic’s armed forces, to modernising the Central African army, and to training gendarmes and police. On September 14, 2019, Russia completed the delivery of the second batch of weapons to the Central African Republic, which covers our small arms needs in full. We hope that Russia will continue to train our personnel, train officers for our army, including at Russian military academies.
We also expect our Russian partners to supply us with lethal weapons with a calibre of over 14.5 mm, as well as armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, mortars and other artillery weapons, which will help us strengthen our defence and security forces. We asked the Russian Defence Ministry to train four helicopter pilots and helicopter maintenance specialists. The resolution on easing the arms embargo, which was adopted by the UN Security Council on September 12, based on the French project, is insufficient, as our needs for small arms were met after we received the second batch of Russian weapons. We need heavier weapons to build effective forces in the CAR. Illegal armed groups smuggle such weapons.
It turns out that the sanctions imposed in 2013, when there was no legal government in the Central African Republic, are now directed against the legitimate authorities, because illegal groups receive heavy weapons illegally, bypassing the embargo. So, we cannot regain control over our entire country.

I am very happy to meet with you.
First of all, I would like to express my condolences in connection with the lives lost in a traffic accident and a plane crash in your country. These are always tragic events.

All news about the trip to Sochi. Russia-Africa Summit
Speaking about our relations, I must say from the start that we view the Democratic Republic of the Congo as one of our most promising partners in Africa, on the African continent. It has substantial trade and investment potential. We know this potential is linked with rich natural resources and the capabilities of your people.
Russian-Congolese cooperation is constructive and based on mutual respect. In the very first months of your independence in 1960, the Soviet Union rendered significant assistance to the government of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. He is a truly legendary man, a legendary fighter for the liberation of African nations from colonialism. He was well known in this country and enjoyed enormous popularity and support among the Soviet people.
Next year we will celebrate the 60th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. Nonetheless, our current meeting is the first contact between our countries at the top level.
Mr President, I am convinced that your visit to Russia will help step up our ties in all areas.
Our trade is still small in absolute figures, but in 2018 it increased by 45 percent. We see good prospects in ore mining. We hope our companies that are interested in working in your country receive support. We are ready to work in other areas as well, for instance, transport engineering and infrastructure. I hope we will now talk about this in more detail.
I would like to thank you for coming to Sochi today.
President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Felix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
On behalf of the delegation that is accompanying me – it includes many ministers from my government, as well as experts from our Cabinet and advisers – I would like to thank you for the exceptionally warm welcome that was accorded to us. We are very pleased with the accommodations. Many thanks from the bottom of my heart for the honour you are extending to us.
I also wanted to thank you in person, because I know that, via your ambassadors, you were the first world leader to congratulate me on taking office. This serves to confirm that, as you say, you were with us in the first hours of our independence, and this is also proof that you will never stop supporting us. You know, it was the first such transition in terms of elections in our country.
Thank you very much for your efforts at the UN. Every time the Security Council reviews issues on its agenda, Russia invariably supports our country’s official position. We would like this practice to continue. That is why we came to Russia. We would like to emphasise the relations between our countries.
You mentioned investment, which should grow. We came to Russia so that your country would take even more interest in making additional efforts with us to develop our country.
Our programme is aimed primarily at the Congolese people, and we want our people to be able to feel certain progress and evolution, because people are also a development tool. If we do not think about the people, nothing will work. First, we must think about health, education and employment, since the people should contribute to growing our wealth.

Plenary session of the Russia–Africa Economic Forum
Vladimir Putin and President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, African Union Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Russia–Africa Summit Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took part in the plenary session of the Russia–Africa Economic Forum.
October 23, 2019
11:45
Sochi
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, heads of state and heads of government of the African countries, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to offer my heartfelt greetings to all of you, participants and guests of the Russia−Africa Economic Forum timed to coincide with the first ever summit of Russia and African states.
All countries of the African continent are represented here today, by top officials, politicians and, of course, business leaders. Top managers of almost 2,000 Russian and foreign companies are taking part in this forum. The topic of this plenary session, Russia and Africa: Uncovering the Potential for Cooperation, is extremely important and relevant.
Economic issues are an integral part and an actual priority of Russia’s relations with the African countries. Developing close business ties serves our common interests, contributes to the sustainable growth of all our countries, helps to improve quality of life and solve numerous social problems.
A lot of effort went into the preparations for this forum. Multiple events on specific fields of Russian-African cooperation have been held over the past year. They include an economic conference and a meeting of the African Export-Import Bank Board of Directors in Moscow last June.
The programme of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum included a special session on advancing cooperation with the African continent. There have been many other themed exhibitions, seminars, Russian-African business mission exchanges, in-depth and engaged discussions of prospective joint projects in trade, investment and industry-specific programmes.

To reiterate, African countries are becoming increasingly attractive for Russian businesses. This is largely due to the fact that Africa is becoming a global economic growth centre. According to experts, Africa’s GDP will have reached $29 trillion by 2050.
Russia-Africa trade more than doubled over the past five years and exceeded, as our colleague just said, $20 billion. Is that a lot or a little? A colleague of ours said this is a good figure. I cannot agree with this. I think it is way too little. After all, ladies and gentlemen, keep in mind that Egypt accounts for $7.7 billion, or 40 percent, of these $20 billion. We have many potential partners in Africa, lots of them. They have good development prospects and enormous growth potential. Of course, this is not enough.
Notably, the product range of counter trading is expanding, and the share of non-resource – agricultural and industrial – products is increasing. Russia is among the top ten suppliers of food to the African market. We are now exporting more agricultural products than weapons to the markets of third countries.
Weapons account for $15 billion of our exports, whereas agricultural products are nearing $25 billion in sales, I believe. So, the potential for development is good here, too, and there are things to discuss.
We hope that taking all this together will continue to push the trade numbers up, and, I believe, we can easily at least double the volume of trade within the next four to five years.
Integration processes unfolding in Africa provide additional opportunities for cooperation. We welcome the creation of the African Continental Free Trade Area as part of the African Union and are willing to work with this new entity.
We support establishing close working contacts between the AU Commission and the Eurasian Economic Commission, which will sign a memorandum of understanding tomorrow. As an active participant in the EAEU, Russia will do its best to facilitate the convergence of trade regimes in the African Free Trade Area and the EAEU common market.
Notably, bilateral intergovernmental commissions and business councils established with many African countries work energetically on the economic agenda of Russia-Africa ties. Russia plans to expand its trade mission network, to support businesses and to establish new contacts.
The Coordinating Committee for Economic Cooperation with Sub-Saharan Africa created under the auspices of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has a good track record. This committee assists Russian entrepreneurs in accessing the African markets and helps businesses implement joint investment projects.
Many Russian companies have for a long time and successfully worked with their partners from various sectors of the African economy and are determined to increase their presence in Africa. We will support such plans at the state level.
Gazprom, Rosneft, and LUKOIL are implementing promising oil and gas projects on that continent. Alrosa is developing diamond deposits, Yandex is present on the markets of a number of countries, and helps African states address information security challenges and develop the digital economy. Rosatom is willing to build the nuclear industry for its African partners as a turnkey project and to build research centres based on multipurpose reactors.
The construction of the Russian Industrial Zone in Egypt is nearing completion. This is a major site in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, where Russian companies will be able to localise their production facilities. About 20 Russian companies will participate in this project. This is the current estimation and I am quite certain there will be more of them.
Friends,
Russia provides systematic assistance to developing the African continent. We provide trade preferences and cooperate within international organisations, such as the World Food Programme, the International Civil Defence Organisation and the World Health Organisation.
Our country is participating in an initiative to ease the African countries’ debt burden. To date, the total amount of write-offs stands at over $20 billion.
Joint programmes have been launched with a number of countries involving the use of debt to finance national economic growth projects.
We have developed cooperation in the fight against dangerous infectious diseases. In particular, a Russian research centre of epidemiology has been established in Guinea. (Applause.) Yes, it is a very good project; it turned out to be very effective. Our country was one of the first to respond to the Ebola epidemic by allocating over $60 billion for fighting it. It should be said that the vaccine is very effective. I believe it is the best in the world.
Training of skilled personnel is a traditional sphere of Russian-African cooperation. By the mid-1980s, we had built about a hundred educational establishments in Africa and half a million Africans have been trained for work at industrial companies and agricultural facilities in African countries. Currently, 17,000 Africans are studying here in Russia, including some 4,000 who are on federal scholarships.
Friends and colleagues,
This forum has a packed business programme. After President el-Sisi and I complete our speeches, the participants in this plenary session will be introduced to practical ideas and proposals in the promising spheres of Russian-African cooperation. The heads of Russian companies and the Economic Development Ministry have prepared presentations for the key Russian competencies, which open up new opportunities for our economic cooperation with Africa.
It is notable that numerous specific sessions will be held during the forum, in particular in the field of oil, gas and nuclear energy, mineral production, agriculture and high technology. You will have an opportunity to discuss concrete spheres of cooperation and coordinate agreements on mutually beneficial joint projects.
I am absolutely certain that this forum will give a fresh impetus to the further development of the entire range of trade and economic cooperation between Russia and its African friends.
I wish all of you taking part in this forum every success and all the very best. We are grateful that you decided to come to Russia.
Thank you.
President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, African Union Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Russia-Africa Summit Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
(retranslated): In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.
Your Excellency President Vladimir Putin.Your Excellencies, heads of state and government of the African countries, good afternoon.
First of all, allow me to express my deep gratitude to President Vladimir Putin and commend the friendly people of the Russian Federation for their hospitable welcome and the wonderful arrangements for the Russia-Africa Summit.
We very much appreciate the attention the Russian Federation attaches to strengthening cooperation with Africa, and view the economic forum as an important platform for showcasing the potential of investment and trade between our peoples. This will definitely help us further strengthen our ties in keeping with the African Union’s Agenda 2063.
We are compelled by the aspirations of our peoples to step up our cooperation even more in order to deliver on our legitimate desire to achieve peace and stability, economic advancement and development. Our people are urging us to rely on the positive experience of other countries, primarily Russia, which reflects our strong commitment to succeeding in our efforts.
Proceeding from this premise, we reaffirm the importance of making this forum a success. Its outcomes will help unleash the potential of African countries and empower them to deliver on their plans.
African countries are committed to infrastructure development and regional integration, which is a priority for Africa.
We also intend to invest in human capital, which is extremely important for us, since it is the main prerequisite for ensuring sustainable development and economic expansion on the continent. This has special importance since young people below the age of 25 account for about 65 percent of Africa’s population and therefore have immense potential on the labour market.
We are also making substantial efforts to support African women and enhance their role in economic development.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Africa is entering a new, important stage of development linked with substantial changes for the better and the development of market, investment and capital opportunities. Africa’s industrial potential and digitisation are growing. This is largely a result of the creative efforts of our youth and the policy of states that actively encourage and support the aspirations of their people.
Addressing the participants of the forum, I would like to emphasise in this context that we have already done a great deal to implement economic and political reforms. We have made great strides towards regional and pan-African economic integration. Our most recent achievement in this respect was the launch of the operational phase of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement that was signed in Niger in July 2019 and attracted serious attention of the international community.
In this context, Africa welcomes the efforts to encourage an open door policy and cooperation with its partners with a view to making a breakthrough in developing its economic and scientific potential, upgrading pan-African industry, building technological infrastructure and laying the foundations of the digital economy.
I would like to invite once again all private companies of Russia and other countries as well as international financial organisations to develop cooperation and invest in Africa. Now is the best time to do this.
I would also like to urge international and regional financial organisations to take part in funding Africa’s economic growth and to give it financial guarantees on consolidating its economic potential. This would help promote trade and investment.
We also urge other countries to grant African states generous terms for their projects and development programmes, which will help African nations reach their dream – to embark on the road of progress, modernisation and sustainable development.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Before concluding my speech, I would like to emphasise that cooperation with African states must be based on common interests, on the protection of African property, which would allow African states to promote comprehensive sustainable development by carrying out three major goals.
First, it is necessary to accelerate economic reforms and create a businesslike atmosphere by establishing close partnership with the private sector.
Second, it is essential to implement social justice principles with the broad participation of society.
Third, it is necessary to consolidate peace and stability in accordance with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and Sustainable Development Goals 2030.
In conclusion, I would like to express the hope that our forum will help expand cooperation between African countries and Russia in the most diverse areas in the near future.
Thank you for your attention.
I wish you peace and the blessings of Allah!

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
Welcome to Sochi.
I remember your visit on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries.
We share a common task: to develop trade and economic ties and increase mutual trade. In this respect, I would like to note the decision to create a working group on cooperation in the mineral and raw materials sphere as part of the intergovernmental commission, adopted in October 2017 during a Russian business mission to Kampala. With its active participation, an agreement was reached in April 2018 to establish Uganda’s national system for identifying, evaluating and certifying mineral fields and to further create a comprehensive analytical lab with international accreditation in cooperation with Russia. I believe that a good task has been set, which will create conditions to step up our work.

We are also satisfied to note that several joint economic projects have already got underway in Uganda. A cotton processing plant operates with a share of Russian capital. Russia’s Unity trading house founded UgaRuss in Kampala to supply consumer goods made in Russia.
We can also see opportunities for cooperation in construction, information technologies and cybersecurity, agriculture, medicine, pharmaceutics, telecommunications, helicopter use and maintenance, and the environment.
Mr President, I am very glad to have another meeting with you. Thank you for coming to Sochi to take part in the first Russia–Africa Summit.
President of Uganda Yoweri Kaguta Museveni: Your Excellency,
First of all, I thank you for calling this Africa–Russia conference. It has been long overdue. Russia had such conferences with India, with China, even with Turkey, Japan. And yet, when we were fighting for freedom, it was Russia who supported us, so it is good to have this meeting now, the Africa–Russia meeting.
It is good that your intermission has started the meeting, and it is going well, so what I want to say at this meeting is a few areas, which we could look at. Number one is defence and security. We have been cooperating very well, we have supported our building an army by buying good Russian equipment, aircrafts, tanks, and so on. We want to buy more. We have been paying cash in the past, cash, cash, cash. And this slows down the pace, because we must have cash to pay. What I propose is that you supply and we pay. That would be some sort of supply that would make us build faster, because now we pay cash, like for this Sukhoi jet, we paid cash.
Now this would affect the batches, but also we want to build a workshop for maintenance, overhaul and upgrade, because we have quite a bit of Russian equipment there, and now to overhaul, we need to bring it all the way back to here and then back. Transport costs. So we want to localise the maintenance and overhaul.

With President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, friends,
Next year we will mark the 60th anniversary of the declaration of Nigeria’s independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. I would like to remind you that we signed the fundamental document for our interstate cooperation, the Declaration on Principles of Friendly Relations and Partnership, in Moscow in 2001.
I would like to thank you, Mr President, for taking part in the first Russia–Africa Summit. We highly value your participation and I hope it will be useful for developing our bilateral relations.
At the beginning of our conversation I would like to note that Russia’s and Nigeria’s approaches to many current issues on the international agenda are very close and we rely on continuing this cooperation in future.

We also give priority to the joint search for opportunities to broaden trade, economic and investment cooperation. Even though it is a small volume in absolute terms and in our opinion it falls short of our potential, still it is growing considerably, last year the growth was 93 percent.
The key role here belongs to the Intergovernmental Commission for Economic Cooperation and the Russia – Nigeria and Nigeria – Russia Business councils set up in 2006–2007.
A successful bilateral business forum took place in May this year. Our delegation consisted of representatives of over 10 companies. Our countries’ Chambers of Commerce and Industry also maintain contacts.
Mr President, I very much hope that your current visit to Russia will give a new impetus to the development of our relations in all areas that are of interest to our countries.
President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari: Your Excellency, governors, ministers, distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
Your Excellency, I would like to commend you for organising this first Russia-Africa Summit. The level of economic and trade relationship between the Russian Federation and our continent could be significantly increased. I sincerely hope this summit will be the anchor to kickstart what has been a very cordial and mutually beneficial relationship in past years.
Nigeria is the most populous country and the largest economy in Africa. We have the people, the resources and the market to be successful. We also have the capacity, capability and capacity to use such resources to bring peace and prosperity to not only our citizens but our region as a whole. Thanks to the support of our friends and allies, like the Russian Federation, we have significantly reduced the terrorist Boko Haram.
We allocate sizable amount of our budget to infrastructure development and education to meet our current needs while keeping an eye on the future.
As you are aware, Nigeria is on track to be the third most populous nation in the world by 2050. Therefore, our modest gains must be sustained and expended for this larger population. To achieve this, we will need partners.
Mr President, there are many similarities between Russia under your leadership and Nigeria’s aspirations for the future. We can learn a lot from the experience of Russia’s ongoing reforms, of transitioning from oil-dependent economy to a modern, diversified and inclusive economy. Russia has through these reforms successfully privatised a number of state-owned entities, which have now become global household names. This is especially so in the energy, manufacturing, defence and the metallurgical sectors.
