Meeting with President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, African Union Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Russia-Africa Summit Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Russia.
At the beginning of our meeting, I would like to thank you for your support during our preparations for the summit’s events that involve the heads of state and government from African states and Russia, and which are scheduled to take place today and tomorrow. We are hosting such a large-scale event for the first time, and your support was vitally important and timely.
As for our bilateral relations, they continue to develop very successfully. In 2018, our trade increased by 14 percent and reached $7.7 billion. We continue to implement ambitious projects that have been coordinated by us, including a nuclear power plant and an industrial zone in Egypt. We are working very actively in these areas, and we are planning to invest $190 million in infrastructure development projects and to attract up to $7 billion.

By the way, I have recently visited our common friends in the United Arab Emirates. They became extremely interested in our joint project and will also think of how to become involved in our joint industrial development plans.
We have many infrastructure and transport projects.
Mr President, we maintain constant personal contacts: this is our third meeting in 2019. Cooperation between our foreign ministries and security services includes a broad range of issues on the international agenda, the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
We are very happy to see you. Welcome.
President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for your hospitality and the warm welcome I have been given in this wonderful city of Sochi.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for holding the first Russia-Africa Summit. Our relations have a long history in many fields and spheres, starting with Russia’s support to the liberation movement in Africa. I would like to say that we are interested in coordinating our efforts with Russia so as to ensure the success of both the summit and the forum. We strongly hope that thanks to the contribution from many African countries we will attain practical results in the interests of all countries and parties based on mutually beneficial cooperation.
I would like to point out that we view Russia as a reliable partner of the African continent. We hope very much that Russia will be working in Africa in all spheres and fields, including in that of the development, as well as in the financing of infrastructure projects on the continent and in particular in energy and road construction.
As for bilateral relations, Mr President, I would like to assure you of our high appreciation of our bilateral relations, which are developing in various formats, especially after we signed a comprehensive cooperation agreement. We sincerely hope that our relations will continue to develop in all fields and spheres.
I would like to speak about the spheres where we will be working together. Speaking about the Russian Industrial Zone, we have a strong interest in accelerating the implementation of this project in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. We also want to settle all the outstanding problems, so that Russian companies and enterprises come to Egypt, register and start working in this zone.
We highly appreciate our bilateral relations in the sphere of railway lines and the manufacturing of train carriages in Egypt. We hope very much that the Russian company concerned will be able to work in Egypt, especially after it has delivered 1,300 carriages to the country.
As for the nuclear power plant, we set a high value on our bilateral cooperation. We strongly hope that all topics related to this project will be settled without delay so that we can start implementing the project in accordance with the signed contract.
Mr President, I would like to invite you to visit Egypt once again so as to be able to attend the ground-breaking ceremony of this vital project and also to attend the signing of the contract on the Russian Industrial Zone in Egypt.
Mr President, we also hope that the Russian side will provide support to nuclear energy facilities in Egypt so that we can work and act in accordance with the approved schedule.
As for military cooperation, we have a strong interest in promoting our cooperation in this sphere, because we know that Russia has been a traditional partner in the field of military technical cooperation for many decades.

Meeting with President of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob
Vladimir Putin met with President of the Republic of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob in Sochi.

With President of the Republic of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
Welcome to Russia.
To start with, I would like to note that next year we will be marking an important date – the 30th anniversary of independence of Namibia and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.
Over these years, an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust has formed between our countries. We appreciate the Namibian leadership’s position of support of our initiatives at the UN, as well as of Russian candidates at various international organisations.
I would like to point out that our political dialogue is developing, and we can see a positive trend when it comes to trade and economic ties. Trade grew more than seven times last year.
We have good prospects in an entire range of fields. This includes energy. Exploration of mineral resources, in particular, Namibia’s uranium resources, can become an important part of our cooperation. Russia is the fifth largest producer of uranium raw material in the world. Russia, as a world leader in nuclear energy and nuclear fuel production, and Namibia, as a major uranium producer, could establish close cooperation and become good partners.
Such spheres as joint exploration of fields potentially rich in vanadium, copper, gold and other minerals is also quite an interesting area of cooperation. We have a legal basis for this. In 2016, we signed intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in geology and mineral resources as well as a memorandum of understanding between Zarubezhgeologiya and a Namibian company.
We also have potentially interesting offers in the diamond industry. Our largest diamond producer, Alrosa, is ready to host a Namibian delegation in Moscow to discuss matters of mutual interest.

We also have interesting prospects in transport. The United Wagon Company is negotiating with a company from Namibia to upgrade railways and supply freight cars and spare parts; they are also discussing an opportunity for SKD assembly on the spot, in Namibia.
Construction of surface facilities for air travel can also be economically advantageous. Our companies are interested in working together in hydropower engineering.
We are ready to promote cooperation in the field of agriculture, for example, to import Namibian food products, such as meat and fish. We hope to organise counter trading of our animal products to Namibia and to expand our exports of grain and fertilisers.
Mr President, we have a lot of interesting fields when it comes to cooperation. I would like your visit to encourage our economic operators to work more actively.
Thank you very much.
President of Namibia Hage Gottfried Geingob: Thank you very much for this opportunity.
To us – we are former freedom fighters, who fought against colonialism – Russia has always been there, where our people were oppressed. So those of us from Namibia, SWAPO Party, although its name has changed, it was the Russian people, who were welcoming us, taking care of us, sharing the trenches in Africa. Difficult times for some of them. So I am very honoured to meet you, we are glad to renew now the relationships. During the difficult times we are together. Now it is time when our old friends can come and see how we can cooperate in what we are calling as our second phase of the struggle, that of economic emancipation. So I am glad to say that already our military people instructed me to say they want to have Russian military advisors and so on, to start with.
As for the other many things Your Excellency mentioned. Our bilateral relations are good, but not as good as they could be because of the old relations we had. The areas you’ve mentioned are all important. I was surprised you have mentioned already what I was supposed to mention. Education, we have students who are studying here, doctors, medical doctors.
Energy is the biggest problem and issue that we can discuss. Uranium we have, we don’t use it ourselves. Our friends who can use it, can come and call as law as we said earlier. But before that I must thank you for not leaving our country in a serious trouble, and you came to our aid, so thank you very much. About uranium, yes, we are uranium producing country and we will be welcoming those who would like to come and use it.

Meeting with leaders of African regional organisations
Vladimir Putin and President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, African Union Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Russia-Africa Summit Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took part in a working breakfast with the leaders of African regional organisations.

Meeting with leaders of African regional organisations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends and colleagues,
President el-Sisi, ladies and gentlemen,
I am delighted to welcome the heads of state and government that now chair the main regional organisations of Africa. I would also like to welcome the heads of their executive bodies.
Those present here include representatives of the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the East African Community (EAC), the Group of Five for the Sahel intergovernmental organisation, and the African Export-Import Bank.
I would like to emphasise that Russia is taking an active part in the regional integration processes on the vast space of Eurasia and is part of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). We consider it important to discuss the prospects of cooperation between the EAEU and the African organisations represented here. Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission Board (EEC) Mr Sargsyan will share his views on this matter.

Incidentally, the EAEU has already established contacts with a number of African countries. Talks are underway on the creation of a free trade zone with Egypt and a memorandum on cooperation was signed with Morocco. Tomorrow the EEC will sign a memorandum with the AU Commission, thereby laying the foundation for multifaceted cooperation between two integration associations.
Naturally, Russia is willing to develop partnership with African regional organisations not only through the EAEU but also on a bilateral basis. I would like to mention in this context a memorandum on the basic principles of relations between Russia and the AU that will be signed here in Sochi. This document will map out guidelines of the major joint projects and initiatives in the political, trade, economic, social and humanitarian fields.
This is just one example of mutually beneficial cooperation. But we are interested in establishing and effectively developing cooperation with other African leading regional organisations too, for instance, the EAC. By the way, taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to wish its Chairman, President of Rwanda Paul Kagame, a very happy birthday! Let’s wish him all the very best. (Applause.) He is celebrating his birthday in our close-knit company but, regrettably, has to work.
In general, we hope that today’s discussions will be beneficial and will create prerequisites for reaching specific agreements on the development of cooperation between Russia and the EAEU and African integration associations.

Meeting with President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera
The President of Russia had a meeting with the President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera.

Meeting with President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am really delighted to welcome you once again to Russia. In May 2018, we had an extensive meeting on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Today, Mr President, we would like to thank you for being able to take part in the first Russia-Africa Summit.
I know that you have already visited Sochi, and I hope you like it here.
The Central African Republic is Russia’s promising partner on the African continent. As we know, Russia was among the first countries to recognise the independence of your state by establishing diplomatic relations with it. Next year, we will be marking the 60th anniversary of these significant milestones in our interstate history.
Our countries maintain friendly relations. At certain stages, between 150 and 200 specialists from this country worked in your country.
We welcome your desire to expand diverse cooperation with Russia. We realise that, as a national leader, you face the difficult tasks of overcoming the consequences of a protracted military-political and socioeconomic crisis. In turn, we will do our best to support your efforts to stabilise the situation in the country and to strengthen mutually beneficial trade and economic, cultural and humanitarian ties.

Regarding trade and economic relations, we, of course, still have to accomplish a lot here. Good prospects are opening up here, including those in the field of agriculture, energy, industrial equipment supplies, and so on and so forth.
We need to think of how to completely activate the economic potential of our states. I suggest compiling a list of promising joint projects that can be implemented and exchanged. Based on this document, we will be able to look for our economic operators, Russian companies interested in working in your country.
The most important task is to streamline the contractual legal framework and to create favourable conditions for investment and for Russian business operations.
I believe that we will be able to discuss all these matters during our meetings today, including those on the sidelines of the summit and in an informal setting.
Thank you very much.
President of the Central African Republic Faustin Archange Touadera (retranslated): Mr President, my dear friend, ladies and gentlemen,
First, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for the honour of being invited to the first Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi, accorded to my country and me, and for this meeting which we will use to discuss our cooperation.
I also want to thank you on behalf of the people of the Central African Republic, as well as on behalf of its government, for the excellent quality of our friendly relations and cooperation, which are enriched every day with the specific actions that you take with regard to the Central African Republic.
Russia has provided enormous assistance to the Central African Republic in the military sphere, contributed to training soldiers for the Central African Republic’s armed forces, to modernising the Central African army, and to training gendarmes and police. On September 14, 2019, Russia completed the delivery of the second batch of weapons to the Central African Republic, which covers our small arms needs in full. We hope that Russia will continue to train our personnel, train officers for our army, including at Russian military academies.
We also expect our Russian partners to supply us with lethal weapons with a calibre of over 14.5 mm, as well as armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, mortars and other artillery weapons, which will help us strengthen our defence and security forces. We asked the Russian Defence Ministry to train four helicopter pilots and helicopter maintenance specialists. The resolution on easing the arms embargo, which was adopted by the UN Security Council on September 12, based on the French project, is insufficient, as our needs for small arms were met after we received the second batch of Russian weapons. We need heavier weapons to build effective forces in the CAR. Illegal armed groups smuggle such weapons.
It turns out that the sanctions imposed in 2013, when there was no legal government in the Central African Republic, are now directed against the legitimate authorities, because illegal groups receive heavy weapons illegally, bypassing the embargo. So, we cannot regain control over our entire country.
