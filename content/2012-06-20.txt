President of Indonesia SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO (retranslated): Your Excellency, Mr President,
Thank you very much for finding time in your busy schedule to meet with me and the Indonesian delegation.
It will be my pleasure to come to Vladivostok to take part in the APEC summit, and I plan to visit St Petersburg next year.
Our countries’ relations, especially our trade and economic relations, are growing steadily despite the global economic crisis.
In this respect, I would like to hear your views on what we can do to intensify our countries’ relations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, it is a great pleasure to meet once more with you and your colleagues.
I fully agree with your assessment. Our bilateral relations are growing steadily despite the economic difficulties. Furthermore, these are relations based on trust. It will be a pleasure to see you in Russia, in Vladivostok and in St Petersburg.
Our colleagues in the government ministries and agencies will have to work on setting out further ideas for developing our ties, above all our trade and economic ties, of course.
But we already have some very interesting specific plans and projects. I think we should concentrate on them, complete these projects, and look for new opportunities too, of course. We have great potential opportunities.
