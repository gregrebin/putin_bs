Greetings on Border Guards Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades,
Greetings to the personnel and veterans of the FSB Border Guard Service on Border Guards Day, and heartfelt congratulations to your families and loved ones.
Today we are honouring those who protect the Russian borders, the courageous and brave people who preserve the security of our Motherland and our citizens.
The Russian border service has a long and glorious history. For centuries, it has been the frontier guards who were always the first to push back against the enemy and fight to the last.
This year, we are marking 75 years of the Great Victory and bowing to the valour of the border guards and soldiers who accepted battle on June 22, 1941, and fought for every single outpost from the Polar region to the Black Sea; who marched along the frontline roads from Moscow and the Volga River to Berlin.
In the past years, our border service personnel have proved their utmost professionalism multiple times. They look up to the generation of victors and perform the most challenging tasks with integrity, setting an example of perseverance and strong spirit in combat situations time and again.
We will always remember the service personnel who lost their lives in the line of duty and those who selflessly defended their people and their country.
Comrades,
Today’s generation of border guards is an honourable successor of the legendary traditions and a faithful protector of Russia’s national interests and security. I would like to thank all of you for your honest service, devotion to your duty and the oath.
We understand all too well that the modern world is still fraught with many threats and risks. The objectives you face today are quite serious and demanding.
The primary task is to secure access to Russia from international terrorists and criminals, set up solid defences in the way of trans-border crime, drug trafficking and illegal migration. This requires developing the border infrastructure consistently and building up our operational, technical and workforce capacities.
I am confident that you will continue to perform your duties and serving Russia with dignity, honour and conscience.
Once again, congratulations on Border Guards Day. I wish you good health and every success.
