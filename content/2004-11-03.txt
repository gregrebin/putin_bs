Beginning of Russian-Italian Talks in an Extended Format
November 3, 2004

The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister, dear colleagues and friends,
Allow me once more to welcome you to the Moscow Kremlin.
The Prime Minister and I had the opportunity to exchange views on practically all bilateral cooperation issues and on the most pressing, key, questions of international life. Our common approach will be reflected in the Joint Statement of the President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of Italy.
We both agree that we need to work actively together on issues such as the fight against terrorism. We intend to develop our economic ties. We discussed our cooperation in the energy sector and in high-technology areas such as the aviation-space sector, radio communications and shipbuilding.
I would note here that we received new opportunities for cooperation in space after the Intergovernmental Agreement on Cooperation in the Use and Exploration of Space for Peaceful Purposes came into force in August of this year.
I note with satisfaction that a great number of the agreements reached with the Italian Prime Minister are being implemented.
I am thinking here of the diversification of our economic ties, the development of our humanitarian contacts and creation of conditions that will enable the development of contact between people.
We have signed an agreement simplifying visa procedures for Russian and Italian citizens, agreements on holding language and culture weeks in Russian and Italian schools and on completion of work to set up a Russian-Italian forum â€“ Dialogue Between Civil Societies. I think that we will hear more specific and detailed information today from our colleagues, the heads of the ministries concerned. Once again, I welcome you here and I would now like to give the floor to my colleague, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Italy.
Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi: Thank you, Mr President, for your warm words and thank you for the excellent hospitality you have shown us, on this occasion and on the previous occasions we have come here.
Thank you also for mentioning that many of the projects, the beginning of which we discussed at our joint talks, are now underway. Many of them are now in the complete implementation phase.
I can say that the climate of our relations is indeed positive. There is every reason to affirm that our bilateral cooperation is set on a path of continued development. I think the same can be said of our cooperation on international issues. The talks that we just ended a few minutes ago show that we share the same views on many issues. This means we have all the necessary conditions for closer and more fruitful relations between our governments and our two peoples.
I am sure that our ministers have worked together just as fruitfully as we have, and they can now tell us about the results of their work.

Beginning of Talks with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
November 3, 2004
20:36
The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister,
Allow me once more, this time officially, to welcome you to the Kremlin. I hope that yesterday evening was not too exhausting for you. Today we have the opportunity to continue our talks, both one and one and in an enlarged format.
Relations between Russia and Italy are developing very positively, at fast rates, and have reached a good level. Unfortunately, the European Union commission has not yet formed. I hope that bilateral ties with the leading countries of Europe will help us to maintain the positive dynamic of relations with the European Union.
We are very happy to see you, a person who has often displayed sincere feelings of friendship towards our country, and with all our heart we wish you a warm welcome.
Silvio Berlusconi: Thank you very much, Mr President, for such kind hospitality. Thank you also for the special hospitality that was shown to me yesterday evening. I really did feel at home. We have established warm and trusting relations, which I hope will allow us to have better relations between our two countries.
I would say that relations between Italy and Russia are optimal. I do not see any way that relations could be more open, friendlier or warmer that those that have been established between our two countries.
Yesterday work also began on holding dialogue between our civil societies. Today I was also familiarised with the programme for developing a project, a programme of relations between the universities of Naples and Moscow.
As you know, today for the first time we will present the Joint award of the President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of Italy to people who have done special services towards the development of Russian-Italian relations. I think that we really will be able to do some excellent work today, primarily concerning our bilateral relations on a topic that is very close to us. This is relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union. We will also discuss the joint war on terrorism, which dealt your country such a harsh blow.
Additionally, the Iraq problem will be discussed, and here I would like to note that the idea of holding an international conference on Iraq was first expressed by President Vladimir Putin during a discussion between us. And I think that we will also have the opportunity to talk about the important topic of reform of the United Nations and the UN Security Council.
And allow me to take this opportunity to express my compliments to you for organisations this wonderful exhibition that is currently being shown in Italy, an exhibition that does indeed show the ties that exist between Italy and Russia, including in the cultural sphere. I know that this exhibition will soon come here, to Russia. I wish it success, and can tell you a secret: it is wonderful, magnificent!
Mr Putin: Thank you.
