President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Colleagues,
We met recently to discuss Strategy 2020’s general outlines. Today’s meeting will focus on the macroeconomic aspect as one of the Strategy’s main components.
I do not want rush into things myself, but first want to hear from the experts, listen to our colleagues, in particular as regards the scope our budget possibilities give us for pursuing our strategic development priorities, and also with regard to global issues, including energy price fluctuations and other factors that have an effect on our country and its budget revenue.
Let’s start work.
