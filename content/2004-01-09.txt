Opening Remarks at Russian-Kazakh Talks

Vladimir Putin: Respected Nursultan Abishevich,
Respected colleagues,
Above all, I would like to thank the President for his invitation. I think that it is no coincidence that my colleagues and I are starting the working year of 2004 with a visit to Kazakhstan. The President and I have just discussed key issues of bilateral collaboration, including military co-operation as part of political interaction, and in international affairs. We also spoke about the development of the Collective Security Treaty, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, the common economic space and virtually the entire agenda of inter-state relations.
The Year of Kazakhstan in Russia undoubtedly helped to a certain extent increase the trade turnover and the speed at which the two countries are becoming closer. Nursultan Abishevich has just mentioned this. More than 150 events were held in Russia with our Kazakh friends, and I would like to thank everyone, starting from the President of Kazakhstan, the Government and the Ministry of Culture, for contributing to this. This was great, serious work, which gave a new impulse to inter-state ties in all areas. This had a positive effect for more than just the cultural sphere.
Kazakhstan is one of the Russian Federation’s main trade partners. Indeed, according to estimates, we reached not only just over five, but already about 5.5 billion dollars in 2003. Of course, this is not the limit for what we can do together.
We also discussed how to develop further our interaction in the space and military-technical spheres, and set out measures to expand mutually advantageous co-operation in the fuel and energy sphere.
I believe that it would be important for the next session of the Russo-Kazakh inter-governmental commission on co-operation to analyse in detail how measures are being implemented as part of the bilateral economic co-operation programme for 1998 to 2007 and to reach mutually acceptable decisions on those problems that have to be dealt with.
With regard to other issues of Russo-Kazakh co-operation, I would like to point to the following: one effective instrument to bolster economic relations between our countries could be the establishment of an investment bank. The President of Kazakhstan made this proposal and the implementation of this idea found its reflection at a session of the Council of Heads of State of the Commonwealth in September 2003 in Yalta.
Russia and Kazakhstan could, indeed, play a significant role in forming multilateral financial institutes, and now our experts have come to the conclusion that this could be done on the basis of the CIS Inter-State Bank with the active participation of Russian and Kazakh capital. This would give it a new impulse, a real life. In essence, this proposal is the continuation of the idea put forward by the President of Kazakhstan. The instrument is there, it only has to be filled with real content. In this sense, this means the financial resources of Russia and Kazakhstan, above all. I repeat, specialists, as far as I remember, have agreed on the scale of Russia’s and Kazakhstan’s participation in this bank. The co-chairmen of the Russian-Kazakh inter-governmental commission have agreed that final proposals on this issue will be prepared by the parties for the next session. I think that they should conclude this work in the near future. There are all the conditions for this. At any rate, I would like to tell you, Nursultan Abishevich, that a principled decision has been taken on this in Russia.
We also see border co-operation with Kazakhstan as a priority. The main task is to create the best conditions possible for the development of integration processes between our states. To this end, it is essential that the potential of sub-commissions on border co-operation be used. This is particularly true with regard to drawing up proposals for the establishment of joint plants and the simplification of procedures for interaction between economic subjects. I would suggest that the lack of agreement over the taxation and customs systems in Russia and Kazakhstan remain a serious obstacle here. This largely inhibits the future growth of our reciprocal trade turnover. We shall also focus on the activity of the transport infrastructure and everything that is connected with it. These issues were raised by the President of Kazakhstan during our talks. We shall certainly discuss these problems in isolation. In addition, we shall also discuss the issue you raised that is linked with new Russian legislation in the sphere of migration and Russian citizenship. We have inter-state agreements for this purpose. We shall analyse the entire scope of legislation in this sphere and I am confident that we shall come to acceptable decisions.
I know that you, in my opinion, are planning to visit the People’s Republic of China in the first half of this year. I would like to point to our common interest in developing co-operation as part of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. We have outlined our plans for joint action, including in the sphere of the fight against terrorism and have set out timetable for joint work in this area. There is another aspect that is of an economic and environmental nature: the problem of the rational use of the water resources of Irtysh. I think that we could discuss this subject at a later date, but, in my view, this could become a good example of trilateral co-operation between Russia, Kazakhstan and the People’s Republic of China. We are all interested in preserving these water resources and using them rationally.
With regard to transport corridors, I hope that our specialists will reach conclusions on this issue in the near future, as will those experts who are finishing work on the border question. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has set the task to complete this work by the end of 2004, and I hope that this will be done. For our part, we shall be keeping this under control.
Thank you.

Speech at the Inauguration of the Year of Russia in Kazakhstan
January 9, 2004
17:13
Astana, Kazakhstan
President Vladimir Putin: Respected Nursultan Abishevich,
Respected friends and colleagues,
We have gathered here on a pleasant, solemn and significant occasion. The Year of Kazakhstan in Russia is handing over the baton to the Year of Russia in Kazakhstan to continue the relay of friendship, trust and openness, uniting millions of people in Eurasia and meeting the spirit of our time and the two nations' historical aspirations for brotherhood and unity with each other.
We are meeting at the very start of 2004 and are together entering its first days and opening its very first pages. I see a special and good omen in this. An omen that our partnership and our mutual interests will grow and the two peoples' sincere sympathies will strengthen and be passed on to new generations of ordinary people of the two states.
Allow me, above all, to thank all our Kazakh friends and especially the President of Kazakhstan for the fine organisation of the Year of Kazakhstan in Russia, for his informal and personal participation in many events and projects, and also for the high sense of responsibility shown by the leadership of this country during all the Year of Kazakhstan in Russia programmes.
We have together succeeded in implementing the Year's main idea: to open the road to public and business initiative, and to fling the doors wide for direct human contacts, and for extensive information and cultural exchanges. And, what is particularly important, to create in the changed historical conditions effective stimuli for deepening bilateral contacts and bringing our countries and nations closer together.
I think many people will agree: such large-scale and diverse actions would have been impossible without the active support of ordinary people in our states, without the sincere interest shown by the regions, business communities and public and humanitarian organisations.
Such a step towards each other has been pre-determined by history itself and, I would say, by the very genetic memory and closeness of our peoples. But in no small degree it is also due to an understanding of the obvious benefits of co-operation, to the growth of mutual interest in a joint search for answers to global threats to security and to tough conditions of world competition.
It stands to reason that our successes, as well as problems, have much in common. In the far from simple conditions of the past decade, Russia and Kazakhstan have been able to constitute themselves economically and become influential, democratic powers.
We have been able to maintain inter-ethic peace in our countries, and social stability has become a reliable basis for progress, for further advance.
But our tremendous advantage is that we are not beginning this movement and joint search from scratch, because the economies of the two countries are historically inter-connected, and in the new conditions are demonstrating sustained and high rates of development. And our people are logically and naturally building up new business and human ties.
However, states and governments have, of course, an extremely important role to play here. And in order to occupy a place in the world worthy of our countries and nations, a good deal still remains to be done together. And the effect will be better if we do it jointly. We are to make a real civilising surge in all areas of economic, social and state development.
But even here our common philosophy remains a desire for economic progress and prosperity through close co-operation and integration, and via effective coordination of efforts in global and regional processes.
It is well understood both in Russia and in Kazakhstan: independence and national identity in no way prevent, but rather multiply, the returns from a mutually beneficial and equal partnership.
This is why our two states are actively working to strengthen the Eurasian Economic Community, to co-operate closely in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, and are consistent and active champions of the common economic area of four states — Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. And I would like to point once more to the role of the President of Kazakhstan in developing extensive integration and inter-state co-operation. He has always been and remains a consistent and energetic participant of such processes.
We in Russia prize and treasure good neighbourly relations with Kazakhstan. For us, your country is our close partner and, moreover, a close friend. It is a key ally and a dependable business partner. And we know that the same warm feelings are entertained on Kazakh soil for Russia and the Russian people. Thank you.
Lying ahead of us is the joint and great effort of strengthening inter-state ties. It is within our power to achieve new heights in co-operation in the economy, education, culture and science. It is also our duty to history and people.
We have no right to forget that behind us there are several generations of Kazakhs and Russians inalienably linked by centuries of brotherhood, common life, memory and just kinship that produced our shared cultural and intellectual wealth.
It is my belief that our main objective is to serve the good and basic interests of the people of Russia and Kazakhstan. To make a contribution to the common stock of stability and economic progress in Eurasia.
I wish ordinary people of our states peace and prosperity, and the Russian-Kazakh strategic partnership, fresh successes.
Thank you for your attention.
