Beginning of meeting with President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sargsyan, friends and colleagues,
First of all, I want to thank you for accepting our invitation to come to Sochi.
There is no need to characterise the Russian-Armenian relations; they are extremely friendly, strategic relations, as evidenced by the recent decisions of the Armenian leadership regarding the accession to the Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union. The work is in progress, and I would like to inform you about what has been done in this area so far.
We also have a number of issues on the bilateral agenda, and we will talk about them today. This is also an opportunity to discuss the Karabakh settlement. Therefore, our agenda today is very full and rich.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan
: Thank you, Mr Putin, for the invitation to Sochi and to this meeting.
Three months have passed since our last meeting, and there is a need to take stock of some of our agreements. In addition to our bilateral agenda, I would also like to discuss some issues related to the integration processes, specifically Armenia’s accession to the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union.
Naturally, we are concerned about the situation in Ukraine. If you wish, you could inform us about the measures being taken by Russia, and I, in turn, will describe in detail the situation in our region and the reasons behind Azerbaijan’s deliberate escalation of the crisis on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border and the contact line.
Thank you very much for the warm welcome and excellent conditions for our work.
