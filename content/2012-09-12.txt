We need truly viabletypes of work to teach patriotism and civic consciousness, on the basis ofpublic initiative, the traditional religions, the work of youth and patriotic organisations, historical and regional clubs, and other similar organisations. In other words, it is imperative to effectively build a partnership between society and the state. Just now, I was speaking to the Culture Minister about the idea of creating a military history society in Russia; it worked quite effectively in previous times, so letâ€™s talk about it later and continue this work in Moscow. I think that this is a good idea; it was brought up a long time ago but we have only been discussing it recently on a practical level during the celebration at Borodino Field.
