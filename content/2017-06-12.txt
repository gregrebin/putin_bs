Speech by President of Russia Vladimir Putin during a reception for the national holiday, Russia Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to congratulate you on Russia Day. This holiday marks the centuries-old, uninterrupted path of our Fatherland; our achievements and victories; the pivotal, breakthrough stages and the unending progress to new heights of development. The main credit for the renewal of the country, the strengthening of the state, always goes to its citizens, their work, unity and devotion to the Fatherland. We know this, and not just from history.
The sweeping transformations of the 90s changed the lives of modern generations. We ourselves lived through this difficult, dramatic period. The radical changes affected all branches and levels of government, economic and social relations. Changes of this scale and depth always have varied consequences. Russia, our people have not only lived through a rapid leap forward to a new life – and this is something without which development would be impossible – but also through extremely dangerous, alarming times when statehood was weakened, and the foundations of society were eroding and vulnerable.
However, all of these difficulties were overcome. Year by year, as democratic institutions developed and society opened up, there was a growing understanding of the importance of our roots and traditions, a growing realisation that progress can be made only in a strong, independent country and that the state’s power is derived from political stability, common goals and the consolidation of society.
Together, we were able to preserve the unique diversity of the Russian people, prevent the obliteration and devaluation of the principles of citizenship and patriotism, secure the sovereignty of our country, and clearly define the national interests of Russia. We learnt how to stand up for them, relying, among other things, on historical experience. And this coherent understanding of Russia is our most important possession.
The outstanding achievements of the National Award winners are a shining example of devotion and respect for the Fatherland. Once again, from the bottom of my heart I would like to congratulate you on the high praise that your work in the arts and sciences has garnered.
Dear friends,
In order to achieve success in the economy, in social development, we must understand, hear and respect each other, cherish what has already been done for the Fatherland to improve the quality of the people’s lives, their security. We all need to focus on a positive, creative agenda. Each of us is able to make our own contribution to strengthening Russia. This is our duty to the Fatherland, our responsibility for its present and future.
I would like to propose a toast to a free, prosperous Russia, to the well-being of its citizens! Happy Russia Day!

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Laureates, friends,
Congratulations to you and all Russian citizens on Russia Day.
Today, by tradition, we hold the National Awards ceremony. This is always a special and memorable event, for we honour extraordinary, wonderful and truly outstanding people. Their brilliant achievements are a great contribution to our country and they deserve public recognition.
The scientific and cultural communities have a lot in common. They share an ambition to understand the world and to bring about its harmonious transformation. Science and culture unlock the boundless potential of human beings and humanity in general; they cultivate the values of patriotism, dignity, freedom, honour and decency in society.
Science has played a huge role in Daniil Granin’s life and writing career. His books on the lives of scientists, their breakthroughs and moral quest, have become classics of Russian literature and, along with his journalistic and educational work, they have had a great impact on the worldview of entire generations, and fostered in them the ideals of justice, humanism and compassion. Mr Granin is being recognised for his outstanding cultural achievements. He received his prize on June 3 in St Petersburg.
Dear friends, Peter the Great offered a definition of culture and scientific discovery that has stayed with us forever. He said, “Once the Fatherland is secure and protected from enemies, we must achieve glory through the arts and science.” This year’s winners have fully realised their gifts and talents, and have affirmed their noble mission of service to society and the public.
Their commitment to their work paved the way for the successful cooperation of the creators of the unique hydrodynamic models that laid the foundation for the efficient systems used to develop West Siberian deposits.
The visionary behind their creation, Doctor of Engineering Yury Baturin, has been working on this subject since the beginning of the region’s exploration. Vladimir Bogdanov, Doctor of Economics, has been heading Surgutneftegas for more than 30 years. He and his deputy Anatoly Nuryayev have been actively involved in scientific research as well. The results of their work have made a significant contribution to the advancement of energy-saving technologies and to the development of Russia’s strategic raw materials capacity in general.
Friends, we have a popular saying: “A born doctor.” This is a testament to the high level of knowledge, professionalism, and competence of a doctor, their care and empathy for patients. For our laureates Amiran Revishvili, Akexander Karaskov and Yevgeny Pokushalov, selfless service to people is the guiding principle of their lives. They are internationally renowned scientists, leaders in modern arrhythmology and cardiology, medical theoreticians and practising surgeons. Their mission is to fight a widespread, live-threatening ailment – cardiac arrhythmia. Dr Revishvili said in one of his interviews that you need to be 100% accurate in hitting the target when identifying the causes of complex arrhythmia. The proven diagnostic methods resulting from the work of our award winners have brought us closer to achieving this goal and saving the lives of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people.
Black holes and neutron stars are the field of research of Russian Academy of Sciences member Rashid Sunyaev and Doctor of Physics and Mathematics Nikolai Shakura. They chose this field of astrophysics more than 40 years ago and, as young scientists, developed a theory that brought them international renown. They made their discovery even before the advent of X-ray astronomy. The phenomena predicted by our award winners have been confirmed by extremely powerful orbital observatories and ground-based telescopes. It is difficult to disagree with Mr Sunyaev that we are living in a time that rivals the era of the great geographical discoveries. The only difference is that modern scientists are making their way to the unknown on the scale of the entire universe.
Dear friends, each of you has your own extraordinary story in science or the arts. You have often followed untrodden paths in pursuit of your calling and talent, overcoming all difficulties and proving that you can reach the summits of intellectual and artistic achievement.
Composer Eduard Artemyev is one of the founders of a new direction in electronic music. Being a pioneer is always difficult. Such people face many obstacles, but the Mr Artemyev’s dedication and artistic courage won out over more established approaches to art. Today he is a recognised master, an explorer of electronic music. He is called an architect and poet of sound. Eduard Artemyev is the author of works diverse in both style and genre, including music for films and stage productions. He has worked with the most famous directors around.
Yury Grigorovich burst into the art world with striking and original ballet productions. Freedom has always been important for him and he managed to achieve it through his remarkable talent and tremendous work. His groundbreaking ballet productions are truly perfect. We have all grown up watching them. Mr Grigorovich represents an entire era, and not only in national choreography. He and his art have made a significant contribution to the development of world ballet.
The National Award was presented to Mikhail Piotrovsky, whose name, personality, guiding principles and cultural code are inseparable from the Hermitage. However, scholars know Mr Piotrovsky as a respected expert in Arab studies, an Orientalist. Despite an extremely busy schedule, he finds time for research in the field. Mikhail Piotrovsky, as he acknowledges, takes a conservative approach in his work. For instance, if works of modern world art are exhibited in the Hermitage, they are shown only in combination with acknowledged classics, but this does not prevent the museum from being innovative and integrating the latest technologies. Mr Piotrovsky strongly believes that the Hermitage is a symbol of Russia’s openness. This is the special mission of this great museum, whose development its director has done so much for.
Dear friends, I would like to sincerely thank every one of you and offer you my heartfelt congratulations on becoming laureates of the National Award.
Good luck to you!

Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
As you may know, there are three types science: applied, fundamental and theoretical. However, one of your colleagues present here in the hall recently reminded me of something very interesting. In fact, all science is applied; it is just that the application of the results of so-called fundamental science by humanity is delayed for quite a long time until people know what to do with the scientific discoveries.
Almost all of our laureates spoke of the future to some extent today. However, the future is created today by the efforts of all of our people and by leaders like today’s winners in each of the fields that they represent so brilliantly.
Thank you very much.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.
As you know, today is a special day. Today is a holiday called Russia Day, it is a celebration of our country. And what is a country? It is the people, the country’s citizens. All of us become citizens at birth. This, naturally, is part of our laws, practice and tradition, and at the age of 14 you receive your passports.
By 14, you have managed to achieve, to do a lot. Some of you, as I believe will be mentioned here as well, have displayed the best human qualities – courage, you could even say self-sacrifice. I am referring to those of you who were not scared to lend a hand to another human being in a very difficult situation, to essentially save a life
The most important thing is that possessing such good inclinations, such qualities, you have every chance of doing big, brilliant, important things in your lives. Today, on Russia Day – as you might have seen from the media – here, in the Kremlin, National Awards were presented to our outstanding citizens for their achievements in their narrow field over many years. Each of you, after you choose your own path, will have a chance to do the same.
I am counting on it, and I would like to wish you luck, because, while pursuing individual achievements, we, of course, everybody, including you in the future, will be making a substantial, serious contribution, which is greatly needed for the country, for its development, for preserving its greatness, for its future. You are the future for us, because soon you and your peers will have to shape the destiny of Russia – this much is clear.
I sincerely congratulate you on receiving this very important document, your passport, and wish you all the best.
