The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Francois, colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you to Moscow.
We see that you pay great attention and make a significant effort to create a broad anti-terrorist coalition. You know our position: we are ready for joint work; moreover, we believe it is absolutely necessary, and here our views coincide.
Russia has long been experiencing grave terrorist acts and has been suffering heavy losses, therefore we understand your feelings and the feelings of the French people. I know that tomorrow France will be remembering the victims of the terrorist acts. Together with you we mourn your heavy loss: according to the latest data, 130 were killed and more than 350 injured.
As you may know, Russia has also borne serious losses in the abhorrent terrorist act against our civilian plane. This drives us to join our efforts to fight a common evil. We are ready to cooperate, Mr President, and we are happy to see you.
President of France Francois Hollande
(retranslated): Mr President, Vladimir,
It is true that now we are the terrorists’ target: they carried out terrorist acts in France, and Russia has also recently suffered from similar acts, I am referring to the explosion on board your civilian plane.
We know that terrorism is our common enemy. We know where it is, what it is called, it has its territory, it has its finances, it has its army, and therefore we need to create a broad and powerful coalition to fight this disease.
On Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously voted in favour of a resolution calling on all countries to unite to form a broad coalition to fight terrorism, therefore we have to put forth appropriate initiatives and lead this struggle.
This is why I am here in Moscow meeting with you so we can find a solution to try to walk this road together, to coordinate our actions, to efficiently fight our common enemy and at the same time find political solutions to achieve a settlement.
I believe the time has come to take responsibility for what is happening. On Tuesday, I was in Washington, then I met with Ms Merkel, Mr Cameron and Mr Renzi.
I would like to thank you personally and the people of Russia for the friendly response that followed the terrorist acts committed in Paris on November 13. I would also like to once again express my condolences in connection with your loss.
