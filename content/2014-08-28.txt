President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Moscow.
I am happy to note that our relations are developing successfully. We maintain regular contacts both at the top level and in our working relations. We are developing both bilateral and multilateral ties – I am referring primarily to our cooperation within BRICS.
I greatly appreciate this opportunity to meet with you in Russia. Thank you for accepting our invitation.
President of South Africa Jacob Zuma
: Thank you very much, Mr President, for your warm welcome. I have been received very warmly in Moscow. I am also very happy that our relations are developing very steadily and very surely. I am also happy with the direction that we have set, as are many of my colleagues. As for our relations, particularly in the economic area, I think they are moving forward very well. I appreciate that we have this opportunity to discuss some of the international issues as well.
I agree too that BRICS has opened up a bigger place for our relations, and they are very meaningful on a number of issues. So I am pleased that I am once again here and have an opportunity to exchange views on different issues.
