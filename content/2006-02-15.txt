The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Wolfenson, I am very happy to see you.
I am very pleased to see that you are continuing to work actively even though a lot of time has passed now since you left your post at the World Bank. All the work you have done over this time has laid a good foundation for Russia’s continued cooperation with the Wold Bank.
Our relations have become even closer since that time as Russia is a member of the ‘quartet’ and you are the ‘quartet’s’ representative in the Middle East.
I know that you recently visited the Persian Gulf countries and gathered considerable means for supporting the peace process in the Middle East. I am very glad to have this opportunity to talk with you about the current situation in the region.
James Wolfenson: Mr President,
First of all, thank you for this opportunity to meet with you. I am also very pleased to continue working with you.
It is my pleasure to report to you on the situation, not just as the leader of Russia but also as the leader of the country that holds the presidency of the G8 this year. I have come here to tell you about the situation and also to hear your views, your advice. I am looking forward to the chance to discuss these questions.
