With Andrei Bocharov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Bocharov, you know that I have invited you here because I am considering you as one of the candidates for the post of acting governor of Volgograd Region.
You have a lot of experience working in Russia’s regions and have been a deputy governor. You have visited Volgograd on a number of occasions as part of your work in the All-Russian People’s Front, and have lived there too. You know the region and its problems well, know the issues you would be dealing with there. And you are a Hero of Russia.
I would like to hear your thoughts on this subject today, hear your views on the tasks ahead for developing Volgograd and the region, and discuss with you the various aspects involved.
Andrei Bocharov: Thank you very much, Mr President, for this confidence in me and for inviting me here. I am sure that no matter in what post or area of work, I will ensure that the tasks you set are carried out.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
