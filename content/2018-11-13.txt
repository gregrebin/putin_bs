President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam President Halimah Yacob,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
First of all, I would like to thank you for the invitation to visit the Republic of Singapore and the hospitality extended to us.
As has already been said, it is symbolic that this year we celebrated the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations. During this period, our interaction developed steadily and filled with new content.
Singapore is an important and promising partner of Russia in the Asia-Pacific Region. Madam President and I have had productive, comprehensive and interesting talks; we discussed almost all of our bilateral agenda in a friendly and open atmosphere.
As far as I know, they often say in Singapore that among friends, even water runs sweet as honey. Mutual trust is the foundation of progress, friendship and development. The relations that have developed between us are truly based on mutual respect and trust. This was confirmed by the groundbreaking ceremony for the first Russian cultural centre and Orthodox church here in Singapore today.
I am confident that this gesture and the subsequent construction of the centre will serve as a solid foundation for the development of bilateral relations, especially for the people who will come here, to Singapore, more and more often, will get acquainted with your country and will have the opportunity to visit the Russian Orthodox Church and our cultural centre. The people in Singapore, in turn, will be exposed to the culture of the Russian Federation.
Allow me to make a toast to the well-being and prosperity of Russia and Singapore! To our friendship and Madam Presidentâ€™s health!
