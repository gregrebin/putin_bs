President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Mr President, welcome to Astana. It is a great pleasure to meet with you, as always. I hope you had a good visit [to Uzbekistan].
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Everything went well and I am very happy to visit you in Kazakhstan.
We have an extensive agenda and it is very useful for me that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation [SCO
] summit opens with talks with the President of Kazakhstan.
Nursultan Nazarbayev: Kazakhstan has carried out comprehensive preparations. Our presidency is nearly over, next will be China’s turn. We conducted 110 events, highly useful documents are ready for adoption and all positions have been coordinated. And since ten years is an anniversary, our meeting should have both a business and a festive side.
Dmitry Medvedev: If we talk about the business side, I have looked at the details and I think some very good work has been done during Kazakhstan’s presidency, some major documents have been agreed, and not just formal or festive ones, but very serious documents. I hope that during a working session tomorrow we will discuss and adopt them all.
