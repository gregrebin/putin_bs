Russian President Dmitry Medvedev: Dear Mr President, I am glad to meet you again. There have been quite a few meetings lately, which is evidence of the special nature of strategic relations between Russia and the People’s Republic of China.
I made my first foreign trip [as Russia’s President] to China, which I view as proof of the high level of relations between our countries. I would like to thank you once again for the excellent organization of the visit. Today we can discuss practical issues related to the results of my visit to China.
We are drafting an action plan for 2009–2012. I hope it will be ready by the end of August this year, just as we agreed. We will then be able to coordinate it during our meeting at the SCO summit in Bishkek.
I am really glad to meet you again.
President of People’S Republic of China Hu Jintao (as retranslated from Russian): Mr President, I am glad for this opportunity to meet you again barely six weeks after our previous meeting.
Mr President, I would like to use this opportunity to once again thank you personally and the Russian government and people for your condolences and generous relief aid to the earthquake victims. It came at a critical moment.
Mr President, during your visit you invited school children from the earthquake affected regions for rehabilitation to Russia. This is a vivid proof of Russians’ friendly feelings for the Chinese people. The stage of coordination is over, and a decision has been made to send one thousand Chinese children to Russia. In this connection, I would like to once again express heartfelt gratitude to you, Mr President. I am convinced that this move will have a positive effect on our relations, and will help to carry on friendship to future generations.
You have said that your recent visit to China was successful. China also holds a high opinion of it. We have instructed relevant ministries and departments to work energetically to implement our agreements.
As far as I know, China has presented a renewed action plan to implement the Chinese-Russian treaty of neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation. We will do our best to facilitate agreements by working jointly with our Russian colleagues.
