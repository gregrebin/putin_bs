President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Quite recently, together with our US partners we extended the New START Treaty. We had suggested this to our US partners a long time ago. I am pleased to note that the new US administration has fulfilled its campaign promises in this sphere. We praise this decision.
Today, I suggest that we discuss other steps aiming to curb the arms race and to facilitate overall arms control.
Let’s get down to work.
