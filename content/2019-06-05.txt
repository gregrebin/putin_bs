Russian-Chinese talks in restricted format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chairman Xi Jinping, my dear friend, Chinese colleagues,
We are very pleased to receive you today in the Moscow Kremlin.
Your visit to Russia is a key event in bilateral relations this year, because it is a state visit. But the status of this visit is not as important as the opportunity to meet again, to discuss current problems in relations between Russia and China, and international matters.
As for bilateral relations, your visit, as you know, is timed to a major date – the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. The Soviet Union recognised the People’s Republic of China immediately, the day after it was created and proclaimed. Over this period, many events have happened, but in the last few years, Russian-Chinese relations have reached, without exaggeration, an unprecedented level, also thanks to your direct involvement. But the most important thing is that this unprecedentedly high level of relations is being applied effectively, so the peoples of Russia and China can cooperate and use their competitive advantages on both sides to promote growth.
You and I set a goal to reach $100 billion in trade last year. Thanks to the efforts of our teams, the governments of both countries, we have exceeded this mark, with mutual trade reaching $108 billion. And it has continued to grow in the first quarter of this year, already exceeding 3.4 percent. All this is the result of our joint work and the result of our teams’ performance, and – I would like to emphasize it once again – to a large extent, it is due to your personal contribution.
Welcome again! We are delighted to see you. I am sure that your visit will give another powerful impetus to the development of our interstate relations.
Thank you.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): President Putin, friends,
I feel the same as you do. We are very happy to meet with you once again. I’m pleased to visit Russia once again at your invitation. Though, formally speaking, this is my first state visit to your country, to Russia during my new term of office, but, of course, you and I are not confined to this format. You and I meet all the time at various venues. I would like to once again thank you for taking part in the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, for your major contribution and for your support in successfully holding this forum.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognise our country, from the first day of establishing a new China. Over these years, Chinese-Russian relations withstood trials, changes in global affairs and changes inside our countries. Step by step, we managed to take our relations to the highest level in their entire history. I would like to say that both of us have passed the test before the peoples of our countries. The 70th anniversary is an important milestone and a new start.
Against the backdrop of drastic changes that the world has not seen for the past 100 years, the peoples of both countries and the international community are putting high hopes on us.
There are no limits to advancing our relations; we only need to become better and better. We are ready to constantly improve the positive effect of our high-level relations together with you, side by side, to instil in our citizens an even more profound feeling of unity among our peoples and to put forward even more of our joint initiatives.
I hope and I am sure that this visit will certainly make it possible to achieve new and outstanding success.
Thank you for everything that you have done for my current visit and for your cordial reception. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, dear friend,
I would like to especially thank you for agreeing to take part in the work of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. We will have an opportunity to hear out our colleagues, to speak and to listen to the discussion.

Press statements following Russian-Chinese talks.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, my dear friend, ladies and gentlemen,
I am very pleased to receive President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping in Russia. This state visit by China’s President is taking place in a year that marks an important date – the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. I am pleased to note that Russian-Chinese relations have reached an unprecedentedly high level. This is a truly comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction.
Mr Xi Jinping and I maintain close contact. We regularly exchange visits, talk on the sidelines of international events and pay close attention to Russian-Chinese cooperation in the political, economic, humanitarian and other spheres.
In the course of the talks that just ended, we discussed the current state of and prospects for bilateral cooperation in a business-like and constructive manner and reviewed, in substance, important international issues while paying close attention to Russia-China cooperation in areas that are truly important for both countries. During our discussion and while speaking with our colleagues at the table, I noted that specific and comprehensive work was underway in each area, in addition to the interaction mechanisms that we now have in place.
Press statements following Russian-Chinese talks
As a result, as we all saw, we signed an impressive package of documents, notably, the Joint Statement on Developing Comprehensive Partnership and Strategic Interaction Entering a New Era, which sets new ambitious goals and long-term benchmarks for cooperation.
Naturally, we discussed issues of economic cooperation in detail. China firmly holds the position of Russia’s leading foreign trade partner. Last year trade went up by a quarter to reach a record $108 billion. Tangible success was achieved in investment. About 30 investment projects worth a total of $22 billion are underway with our Chinese partners and Chinese capital. A substantial part of these funds is being invested in projects in the Russian Far East ($3.5 billion).
Russia and China intend to develop the practice of conducting financial transactions in our national currencies. We have just signed an intergovernmental agreement to further expand the use of the ruble and the yuan in bilateral trade to ensure the failsafe bank servicing of transactions in conditions of instability on global markets.
Our energy cooperation is making good progress. Russia leads in oil distribution to China: last year 67 million tonnes of raw materials were sent to China. A gas pipeline to the PRC along the so-called eastern route will enter service in December. Talks are underway on potential fuel exports westwards and also from the Russian Far East.
Cooperation on the production and sale of LNG is being increased. The third stage of the Yamal LNG plant opened in November, one year ahead of schedule. A sizeable share in this plant – almost 30 percent (29.9 percent) belongs to China. We welcome cooperation on another large project – Arctic LNG 2.
The breakthrough agreements on peaceful nuclear energy development reached during our visit to China last year are being carried out. A general contract to build the third and fourth units of the Xudabao Nuclear Power Plant has been signed. The construction of a demonstration fast-neutron reactor is getting started in China with participation of Rosatom.
We focus a lot on strengthening bilateral cooperation in the manufacturing industry. The opening of a plant operated by China’s leading automaker, Great Wall Motors, is timed to coincide with President Xi’s visit. This plant will use advanced technology to make 80,000 vehicles annually, and local content will reach about 70 percent. Today, the President and I will see the products that will be made at the new plant.
Our plans include projects in aircraft and helicopter manufacturing, space exploration, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and other knowledge-intensive industries. We agreed to hold years of Russian-Chinese scientific, technical and innovation cooperation in 2020 and 2021.
We have good prospects for agro-industrial production. The possibility of creating a Russian-Chinese agricultural holding company in the Primorye Territory with an investment of 10 billion rubles is being discussed. Russia and China are planning to jointly develop international transport corridors. To do so, plans are in place to more actively use the potential of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Baikal-Amur Mainline, as well as the Northern Sea Route.
The shared border infrastructure is expanding. The construction of a new bridge and a road bridge over the Amur River is nearing completion. We attach particular importance to strengthening direct ties between Russia’s regions and China’s provinces. The years of interregional cooperation are enjoying success. The Volga-Yangtze Council has been working effectively for quite a while now with the participation of the Volga Federal District and the provinces of the upper and middle Yangtze.
Today, the President of the People's Republic of China and I agreed on establishing two more interregional cooperation mechanisms between Russia’s Central Federal District and North China, as well as between our Northwestern Federal District and the maritime provinces of Southeast China.
This people-to-people cooperation covers many areas. Cultural and cinema festivals, education, youth, and sports exchanges, as well as reciprocal tourism are actively developing in Russia and China as part of a three-year programme for cooperation. Last year, China saw about 2.2 million Russian tourists. In turn, over 1.7 million Chinese tourists visited our country. I just shared with my friend, President Xi, a story where I was moving from one building within the Moscow Kremlin to another and realised that most of the tourists on the square were from China. We can go out and wave to them.
I would like to thank Mr Xi and all our Chinese colleagues for transferring two giant pandas to the Moscow Zoo. We know that China almost never does this. This is a sign of special respect and trust with regard to Russia and our specialists. Whenever we talk about pandas, we smile. We accept this gift with great respect and gratitude. Thank you very much. These animals are a national symbol of China, and we highly appreciate this gesture of friendship. By the way, a little later, the President of the People's Republic of China and I will go to the Moscow zoo and marvel at these wonderful animals.
During the discussion of topical international and regional issues, the sides stated that their views are identical or very close on most matters. The joint statement on strengthening global strategic stability we signed emphasises the principled stand of Russia and China that any attempts to destroy the existing system of agreements on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation are unacceptable.
I would like to stress that our countries share identical assessments of the situation around the Korean Peninsula and carry out a joint roadmap for settlement. We proceed from the premise that there is no, nor can there be, any alternative to the peaceful, political and diplomatic settlement of the region’s problems, including the nuclear issue.
We will continue cooperation with our Chinese partners to reduce tensions on the peninsula and enhance security in Northeast Asia as a whole. Russia and China are working for the peaceful settlement of the crisis in Syria, favour stabilisation in Venezuela, and remain committed to the full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear programme.
During the talks, the sides reaffirmed their intention to continue building up bilateral cooperation within the framework of the UN, the SCO, BRICS, the G20, APEC and other leading multilateral venues.
We will continue our efforts to link the EAEU integration processes with the Chinese Silk Road Economic Belt Initiative with a view to forming greater Eurasian partnership in the future.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to use this opportunity to thank once again Mr Xi Jinping and all our Chinese colleagues for productive joint work and to express confidence that the agreements reached during the visit will facilitate the further strengthening of Russia-China friendship and the prosperity of our nations.
The programme of the President of China’s visit continues. Today, we will make speeches at the gala evening devoted to the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations at the Bolshoi Theatre.
As a guest of honour, the Chinese leader will take part in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. He will head a solid delegation – about a thousand government officials and businessmen. We will also talk to the heads of major companies of the two countries that will hold the second Russia-China Energy Business Forum. And – I am pleased to say this in the presence of the rector of St Petersburg State University – there will be a ceremony to present President Xi Jinping with the honorary doctorate of the university.
Thank you for your attention.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, friends, good afternoon,
I am happy to see you together with my old friend President Putin. This is my first state visit to Russia during my second term as the head of the Chinese state. This is also my eighth visit to Russia since 2013. President Putin and I have established close working relations and a strong friendship.
We have met almost 30 times in the last six years. Russia is the most frequently visited foreign country for me and President Putin is one of my closest friends and a great colleague. This is the best reflection of the high level of bilateral relations and close strategic cooperation between China and Russia.
President Putin and I have just held very productive talks in an open and friendly atmosphere. We thoroughly discussed our bilateral relations and also items on the international and regional agendas that are of mutual interest. We have reached important mutual understanding in several areas. We have also signed and published two important joint statements. The relevant agencies and companies have exchanged the signed documents in our presence.
President Putin has just summed up our talks and I fully agree with him. Together we reviewed the development of our diplomatic relations for the last 70 years. All of us believe that as a result of the developments in the last 70 years, Chinese-Russian relations have reached an unprecedentedly high level. We now see new opportunities. So we decided that we would take advantage of this historical experience in the spirit of neighbourliness, friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding, and that we would develop our comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation in this new era and raise our bilateral relations to a new and higher level.
Our countries will further consolidate mutual political trust, build mutual support and assistance in issues that concern our key interests in the spirit of novation, cooperation for the sake of mutual advantage, and promote our relations in the new era for the benefit of our two nations and the peoples of the world.
We note with satisfaction that due to our joint efforts in all areas, our cooperation continues to develop dynamically and successfully. Bilateral trade has also hit a historical high, exceeding our goal of $100 billion. We continue to increase the level and quality of cooperation. We successfully implement large strategic projects in energy, investment, aerospace, aviation and so on.
Region-to-region cooperation in areas like finance, agriculture and e-commerce has great potential. The parties have already decided to hold cross years of cooperation in research, technology and innovation in 2020–2021 in order to further expand and extend this cooperation, improve exchanges and the joint training of research and technical personnel, increase the integrated power and the research and technical level of our countries.
President Putin and I agreed to continue our work on integrating the Belt and Road Initiative with the EAEU. We will support each other in the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Eurasia partnership. We will join efforts to promote regional integration and integration economic development in the region.
We are pleased to note that the people-to-people aspect of our relations is following an ascending curve, and our exchanges are expanding across all areas. The years of interregional cooperation were a success, and traditional friendship between our peoples never stops shining with new light.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, we gave two pandas to Russia for joint research. A little later, President Putin and I will attend an opening ceremony for the panda pavilion at the Moscow Zoo and will meet the two envoys of Chinese-Russian friendship.
The international situation is undergoing profound changes not seen in the past century. Peace and development remain the spirit of the times. However, protectionism and one-sided approaches are increasing, and the policy of force and hegemonism is intensifying. We have a long and difficult path to go before we arrive at peace and development.
As leading world powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and Russia will, in conjunction with the international community, show a sense of duty and resolutely protect the international system, under UN auspices, based on international law, and actively promote political settlements in the hotbeds of tension; we will protect the multilateral trade system, impart positive energy to an extremely difficult international situation, and make new contributions to building a common destiny for all of humankind.
Tonight, President Putin and I will attend celebrations dedicated to the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. I will also visit St Petersburg to participate in the 23rd St Petersburg International Economic Forum. President Putin and I will continue to hold bilateral meetings and will enrich the content of bilateral relations in a new era.
Thank you.

Speech at the gala
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi, friends,
This visit of the President of the People’s Republic of China is timed to coincide with an outstanding event, the 70th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between Russia and China.
In 1949 our country was the first to recognise the People’s Republic of China on the next day after it was proclaimed. Over the past decades Russian-Chinese cooperation has travelled a long way and we have seen many examples of sincere mutual support, friendship and successful joint work.
Today the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China are united by multi-faceted comprehensive strategic partnership based on the immutable principles of respecting each other’s sovereignty, national identity and interests, equality and neighbourliness.
Our countries conduct an intensive political dialogue and build a broad system of mutually advantageous economic ties increasing mutual trade and investment and developing industrial and technological cooperation.
Bilateral trade increased to an all-time high in 2018, reaching $108 billion. At the same time, the People’s Republic of China has firmly asserted itself as Russia’s largest business partner. Russian-Chinese energy cooperation has also become strategic. A trans-border gas pipeline will start operating in late 2019. Chinese companies are involved in producing liquefied natural gas on the Yamal Peninsula, the northernmost Russian region.
Major cooperation prospects are opening up in the aerospace and military-technical sectors. Both sides are analysing plans for establishing joint innovative production facilities. I would like to note that Russian regions and Chinese provinces are actively involved in bilateral cooperation.
Cross-years of Russian-Chinese interregional cooperation are being held successfully. Contacts between the citizens of our countries continue to expand, tourist and educational exchanges are also on the rise, and the Russian-Chinese cultural cooperation programme for 2017–2019 is being implemented. The programme includes a variety of festivals, concerts, film screenings and exhibitions. The people of Russia and China become closer as they gain an insight into each other’s traditions and immensely rich historical and cultural legacy.
Naturally, we strive to cooperate closely on the international scene in the interests of stability, global and regional security. Our countries make a major joint contribution to resolving acute global problems and to countering new challenges and threats. They jointly advocate the creation of a new and equitable world order based on multipolar concepts, unfailing compliance with international law, the UN Charter, equality and mutually beneficial cooperation.
On the whole, we can say with confidence that Russian-Chinese relations have reached an unprecedented level. Considering their tremendous potential, we have no intention of resting on our laurels. Today, we have adopted joint statements setting out new ambitious guidelines for bilateral cooperation.
We are planning to expand cooperation in every field for the benefit of our two countries’ citizens and to promote sustainable development of Russia and China.

Russian-Chinese talks in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends,
President Xi Jinping and I have just held open and intensive talks in restricted format and discussed the most important and pressing issues of Russia-China strategic cooperation. We noted that our cooperation has reached a very high level. It would be no exaggeration to say that this level is unprecedentedly high.
We discussed in detail major international issues and confirmed that the positions of Russia and China on key global issues are close or identical, as the diplomats put it.
Now, following the tradition, we will continue the talks in expanded format and listen to reports by co-chairmen of the Intergovernmental Commission and our foreign ministers on the status of and prospects for cooperation in many diverse areas.
But first I would like to thank my good long-time friend President Xi Jinping for bringing in such a representative delegation of our Chinese partners. There are partners from both sides practically in all areas of our cooperation. I am sure that this will give your visit, Mr President, concrete substance that is absolutely clear to each of us and vital for the implementation of all our plans.
Please.
President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): Thank you, Mr President once again for kindly inviting me to pay a state visit to Russia.
At present, China-Russia relations are making steady headway at high level, going through the best period in their development. Both sides strongly support each other and defend each other’s vital interests. Political and strategic mutual trust is growing. We actively promote cooperation in trade, the economy, culture, people-to-people contacts, and at the regional level. The potential of our relations is increasing and our common interests are closely intertwined. We take an active part in international affairs and government management, thereby playing an important and constructive role in the maintenance of global peace and stability and the protection of international truth and justice.
This year we celebrate the 70th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. At this historic moment we are united with you in realising the need for developing relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation, which are entering a new era. We have achieved this result largely due to the historical experience accumulated in the past 70 years and in conformity with the historical trends and requirements for the development of our relations at a higher level. I think we should use this favourable, historical moment to review our history in a comprehensive manner, expanding and deepening our cooperation so it can attain new life and make a new breakthrough.
I am also very happy to see our ministers from both sides at this meeting. This is a very good opportunity to exchange views and compare notes once again so as to further promote our cooperation.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr President.
We will go to the specific reports, with your permission.
