Meeting on clean-up and relief efforts after flooding in the Far East.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
We have worked in this flood-affected region over the past few days. The situation is difficult; unfortunately in some regions it is still not improving. In some places water is receding, but in others the situation is worsening.
The day before yesterday I asked you to go to affected areas, and yesterday you were in flooded regions. Let’s hear what you found out, and which problems and issues are the most urgent. And then we shall conclude our work by setting out the main provisions of the presidential executive order which will constitute a foundation for helping the region’s citizens and economy.
Let’s get to work.
