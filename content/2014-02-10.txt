While visiting the Sochi Media Centre, Vladimir Putin answered questions from Georgian journalist.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: We are very happy that the Georgian team has come. I think this is an excellent sign and indeed a case of the Olympic Games helping to build relations even where this seemed impossible or very difficult.
As you know, regular flights from Tbilisi to Sochi have already begun, and we have decided that this will continue after the Olympics are over. This is all part of the Olympics’ positive influence. These Olympics are helping us to build relations with Georgia. I am very happy to see this and we wish the Georgian sportspeople success. The Georgians always perform well at the summer Olympics, especially in the martial arts. In judo, my favourite sport, the Georgian team is one of the world leaders. We hope that Georgia’s athletes will perform well here too and we wish them luck.
All the best to you.
Question: Will you meet with the Georgian President?
Vladimir Putin: If he wants to, why not.
