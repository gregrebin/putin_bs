President Vladimir Putin: Our meeting is held on the anniversary of the tragedy in Beslan. Today is the Day of Solidarity with the Victims of Terrorism, and our nation will observe a minute of silence. I suggest we honour the memory of all victims of terrorist acts.

As you know, along with many other countries, Russia is the target of terrorist attacks. Unfortunately our state, along with many others, is not always capable of effectively warding off these attacks, nor of working towards forestalling and preventing acts of terrorism. I must say that as citizens and by virtue of our official capacity, each of us bears the responsibility for everything that happens in this domain.
As you also know, yesterday I met with Beslan's residents who lost their loved ones one year ago. I must say that they are very concerned with how the investigation is going, with the fact that up until now, there is no objective information on the investigation's progress, and which conditions and circumstances made this act of terrorism possible.
I absolutely agree with those who see this investigation – an unbiased and comprehensive one – as a means to fundamentally improve and refine the country's law enforcement system.
I would like to emphasise that the results of this criminal case must be used as a basis for stirring up the activities of the special services and law enforcement agencies.
A product of yesterday's meeting was my ordering the Prosecutor General to send the representatives of Russia's Central Prosecutor's Office to Beslan. They will do a thorough reexamination of all available information.
