 President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.
Attending this gala ceremony in this beautiful hall of the Kremlin are those who devoted their great victories to Russia, who brought it fame and respect. Allow me to welcome you all.
We have recently marked March 8, the International Women’s Day, and in this connection, I would like to say that our women are making great progress everywhere, demonstrating their abilities and talents in the most diverse areas. Their stamina and bravery deserve our admiration.
Thus, the fourth female cosmonaut in the history of this country, Yelena Serova, has overcome all the hardships and trials of a long space flight with confidence. Together with her colleague Oleg Artemyev, she is awarded the Hero of Russia
star and the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation.
Anfisa Chukavina, who works in the assembly of radio electronic equipment, has demonstrated great professional achievements. Lyubov Romanskaya and Nina Sevastyanova have steadily produced excellent results in animal husbandry for decades, while Tamara Purtova has dedicated her life to preserving the rich traditions of Russian folk art and Russia’s cultural heritage.
Undoubtedly, our words of gratitude go to veterans of the Great Patriotic War
. We continue to discover little known facts about the history of the war, paying tribute to its heroes.
One such person is Alexander Pechersky, who headed one of the biggest uprisings of Nazi death camp inmates at the Sobibor camp. However, his feat had been forgotten for a long time, and it is through the efforts of the public and veterans’ unions that justice has prevailed: he is awarded the Order of Courage
. The order will be presented to his granddaughter Natalya Ladychenko.
We consider it our sacred duty to preserve the memory and truth of the war. Its grim lessons remain timely and important for stronger peace and stability and trust between peoples.
For special achievements in the development of humanitarian ties with Russia and his great efforts to retain the heritage of the Great Victory, a state decoration is presented to Jiri Mastalka, Member of the European Parliament from the Czech Republic.
We are grateful to all our friends abroad and we highly value their support and are always ready to work together for the benefit of our countries.
A great contribution to the development of close bilateral contacts with Russia and the strengthening of our strategic partnership is made by First Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan Yaqub Abdulla oglu Eyyubov, who is in this hall today.
Friends, gratitude and openness, a drive for creativity, for serving people, nobility and courage are wonderful qualities.
Pilots Konstantin Parikozha and Igor Kravtsov have saved hundreds of lives. Their stamina, professionalism, proper and decisive action made it possible to avoid a terrible catastrophe in the sky over the Dominican Republic, to land a burning multi-tonne liner without causing casualties and evacuate all the passengers.
Artyom Korolyuk and citizen of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan Marat Isayev performed a brave manly deed. Risking their own lives, they saved a woman who fell onto the rails of the Moscow metro.
Today among those awarded are representatives of leading scientific, production and educational centres of this country.
Outstanding aircraft designer Genrikh Novozhilov is awarded the Order for Services to the Fatherland
I degree. For many years, he headed the Ilyushin Design Bureau, standing at the source of breakthrough modifications of the legendary Il aircraft. Today, despite his respectable age, he is still on the job.
We are also happy to see here President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Fortov and many famous scientists, teachers, actors and doctors.
Your achievements, friends, have been and will remain significant for Russia and its people, helping to resolve pressing matters of the country’s social and economic development.
Taking part in this ceremony are representatives of the traditional religions of this country, people of the arts and culture, and public activists. Through your selfless moral service, you help people, making Russia stronger, supporting the values that form the basis of civic solidarity and public accord.
I would like to congratulate you once again on this high acclaim, for receiving state decorations. I would like to wish you further success and all the best.
 Thank you very much.

V.Putin: Friends, allow me to congratulate you once again on your awards. Thank you very much for the kind words you addressed to me, and I would like to put the ball in your court, as they say: it is a great honour for me to present these state decorations of Russia.
One of you said, “I do not know how soon I would come again on to this hall and stand on this podium.” I must say, we have a lot of achievements, as you have said today. In every area that you represent – aircraft construction, shipbuilding, medicine, art, space – we have a lot to demonstrate to the country and the world, we have some great up-to-date achievements.
However, we also have many unresolved issues – quite a few of them. We should not rest on our laurels, absolutely not. Although, the more often you and other outstanding Russians like you come to this hall, the sooner we will resolve all the issues facing us.
Thank you for your work.

Meeting with President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic
Vladimir Putin met with President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic, who is in Russia on a working visit.
March 10, 2016
16:45
The Kremlin, Moscow
The two leaders discussed the current state and prospects of Russian-Serbian cooperation and pressing international matters.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, allow me to welcome you to the Kremlin.
I would like to begin by congratulating you on receiving the prize of the Unity of Orthodox Nations International Public Foundation. You do a great deal to protect and promote eastern Christian traditions and values. I know it from personal experience – you and I have spoken about it on numerous occasions in private. I would like to congratulate you and thank you for your efforts in this area.
Relations between our states are developing successfully. We will talk about it today.
Welcome.
President of the Republic of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic
(retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much for your congratulations. This award was special for me; I value it because it bears the name of the late Patriarch Alexy II, who was at Serbia’s side and in Serbia through the most difficult times. This is simultaneously an award and an obligation.
Thank you for finding the time for this meeting. Although we have come here for a different reason, this gives me an opportunity to thank you personally for everything you have done for Serbia last year and over all these years.
You cannot imagine how grateful Serbia is to you for two things you have done. They have to do with Serbia’s future, I would say the future of the Serbian Republic. The attempt to adopt the Srebrenica Declaration was an attempt to say that all the crimes were committed by Serbs, the Serbian people, and to reaffirm the stereotypes that already existed that the Serbian people were to blame for the genocide.
Despite the fact that this happened in a different time and under different circumstances, I could compare this to the gesture made by the Russian Tsar who said he would withdraw from the fighting if the allies did not provide ships to pick up the Serbian army from the Adriatic coast, not to mention the fact he got involved in the war only to protect his Serbian brothers.
I know how difficult it is to veto a Security Council resolution, and this gesture will remain in the memory of Serbian people.
I would also like to thank you for the way you acted in UNESCO, when there was an attempt to let so-called Kosovo join the organisation.
I have been waiting for this moment to unburden my mind and say this to you.
At the same time I would like to thank you for your support for Serbia in its attempt to get back on its feet and join a number of developed states, for your understanding of Serbia’s stance in international relations and for the courage Russia has demonstrated to all the other states in the fight against ISIS.
Unfortunately, this is not 1999, otherwise we would not be talking about the bombing of Serbia, and we would not have mentioned it.
This is all I wanted to say in the presence of the press.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
We do share a rich and eventful history and very warm relations that this history proves.
I hope that we will cover a present-day positive agenda. In this connection, I would like to recall the visit by the Serbian Prime Minister to Russia last autumn and of the planned visit by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation to Serbia, hopefully soon.
We can discuss the situation in the region and bilateral relations. I would like to thank you once again for coming to Russia and creating this opportunity.
