With Premier of the State Council of China Li Keqiang.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Premier, friends, welcome to the Moscow Kremlin.
I am pleased that we maintain our contacts at the working and top levels. We have recently celebrated the anniversary of our treaty of friendship. Over this period, we have created an effective mechanism of bilateral cooperation. Its main element concerns the activities and responsibilities of our governments.
I am glad that our consultations and your talks with the Government and the Prime Minister of Russia have been fruitful. We have very good and business-like relations at the top level, with our friend, President Xi Jinping. Please, give him my best regards and remind him that we expect him for a traditional official visit in Moscow in 2017.
Welcome.
Premier of the State Council of China Li Keqiang (retranslated): Mr President, it is a great pleasure to see you again. President Xi Jinping sends his best regards to you.
As you said, we have recently celebrated the anniversary of our big treaty. Russia and China are very big neighbours. We have a comprehensive strategic partnership.
My meeting with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was the 21st meeting of the heads of government of China and Russia. Over the past 20 years, this tradition, this practice never stopped, and this fact alone points to the stable development of Russian-Chinese relations.
Our meeting has yielded very good results, including in the area of practical cooperation. We have launched new areas of cooperation and discussed our potential for cooperation.
We believe that Chinese-Russian cooperation not only benefits our nations. More importantly, it is also good for peace and stability in the region and the rest of the world.
When I return to China, I will certainly convey your best regards and warm wishes to President Xi Jinping.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
