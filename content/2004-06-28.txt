The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin:
Good Day, dear Mr. Speaker. Allow me to wish you a warm welcome to Moscow. I realize that we do not see each other very often, and evidently this is related to the change in your functions. I am very glad that you have found the opportunity to come to Moscow. Relations between Finland and Russia are developing, and they are developing well. I hope that the parliaments of the two countries will be able to make an appropriate contribution to the development of these relations.
Paavo Lipponen: Thank you, Mr. President. I want to pass on a warm welcome from Finnish President Tarja Halonen.
I am very happy that I have been able to come to Moscow today and meet with you as the Speaker of the Finnish Parliament. Very important talks and discussion lie ahead, primarily with the Speaker of the Russian Parliament – the Duma – Mr. Boris Gryzlov. I know that development and improvement of democracy has a very important position in your policies, and this issue is very interesting for us.
And, of course, we will also discuss relations between our two countries. Relations are developing very well, prospects are also positive, and we are now examining a situation whereby Russia becomes our main trade partner over the course of the next decade. This is quite possible.
Vladimir Putin: I hope that this is what will happen.
