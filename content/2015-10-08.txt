With President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, thank you for coming, for accepting the invitation.
I would like to begin by congratulating you on the successful completion of the parliamentary election campaign. Not only on the results, though they were favourable for you and for the political forces that you support, but also on the way the campaign was held – at the highest possible level, in line with all the traditions of democratic countries. This is in full compliance with all the requirements of international organisations; therefore, I would like to congratulate you on that.
I would like to wish success to you and to the new deputy corps, and I would like to wish all of Kyrgyzstan to flourish and to carry through all the plans you have laid out.
President of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with you. Yesterday we discussed a number of bilateral issues, and today we can cover anything that we did not talk about yesterday. This is good, of course.
I believe our relations have reached an absolutely new stage. It is noteworthy that during our parliamentary elections not a single party used any anti-Russian slogans or anti-Russian rhetoric. This is in stark contrast to what we had five years ago. It goes to show that the relations between our countries are completely different.
Vladimir Putin: This is very good and creates favourable conditions for the further development of our bilateral relations.
Almazbek Atambayev: Of course.
Vladimir Putin: Both bilateral and relations within international organisations.
