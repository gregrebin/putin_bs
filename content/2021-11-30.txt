President of Russia President Vladimir Putin: Comrade President,
I am very happy to see you, welcome.
We take part in various online events, but I am glad to see you here in Russia in such a normal way.
This year we already celebrated the anniversary of our Declaration of Strategic Partnership, but relations between Russia and Vietnam run much deeper than the decades that we have lived under this memorandum. We remember this, we truly value the level of our strategic partnership with Vietnam.
It must be said that our relations exist in the context of present circumstances. Despite the pandemic, trade between our countries increased by more than 15 percent last year, and by more than 16 percent over the first nine months of this year.
The itinerary of your visit to Russia is quite packed and ambitious. I know you have prepared a package of important documents in various fields concerning both economic and cultural cooperation.
I am very happy to see you.
Please convey my best wishes to the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Vietnam – we are also in touch. Our foreign ministries maintain regular contact. We have similar positions on many international issues, we constantly work within the UN and regional organisations.
Vietnam remains our reliable, loyal friend and strategic partner.
It is a pleasure to see you.
President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Nguyen Xuan Phuc (retranslated): Comrade Vladimir Putin,
As you rightly said, it is also always a great joy for us to meet with you here in Moscow.
It is remarkable that our current visit is taking place on the 80th anniversary, to the day, of the parade on Red Square. After this parade, Red Army soldiers marched directly to the front and eventually liberated all Europe from Nazism. We all remember this righteous struggle of the Russian people. We have always had special feelings for Russia and take great joy in the enormous achievements made by Russia under your leadership over the past 20 years. We are confident that with your vast experience you will continue leading Russia to success and prosperity.
We would like to make special mention of Russia’s achievements in developing the economy and raising its status in the international arena. We know perfectly well that it was you who reclaimed and upheld Russia’s international status and we, the entire leadership of Vietnam, are very happy about this. We always view Russia as a very important foreign policy priority, a close friend and partner.
Before this visit to Russia, General Secretary NguyenPhu Trong discussed the status of bilateral relations with me for a very long time. We always strive to maintain and build on the traditionally friendly relations between Vietnam and Russia.
I would also like to tell you that before my visit to Russia, I instructed our Deputy Prime Minister Le Van Thanh to work, in cooperation with his Russian colleague, on advancing cooperation in different areas, especially in the Intergovernmental Commission.
We intend to strengthen good political relations between our countries and facilitate the resolution of specific problems in bilateral cooperation with a view to taking our ties to a new level. I can say that we are trying very hard to resolve the issues where Russia has an interest. There are grounds to say that we have managed to resolve a lot of them.
We realise that our problems in bilateral relations are technical or procedural for the most part. But we also understand that they must be resolved and we will do all we can to expedite the solution of these problematic issues.
We are striving to create the most favourable conditions for the work of our companies in order to take our relations to a new, more substantive, and higher level.
Vladimir Putin: We will adopt a statement today. I think it will also reflect the level, the status of our relations. We will continue moving forward.
Nguyen Xuan Phuc: As you rightly said, this joint statement is very important. We believe such statements facilitate the long-term development of our relationship. We also need other framework agreements and statements that will become guideposts for bilateral cooperation.
I am very happy that we have managed to coordinate this highly important document. It contains many specific items that are important for our relations in the short- and long-term perspective.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
