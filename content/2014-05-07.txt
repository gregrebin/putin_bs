President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, good afternoon, we are very happy to see you here.
I think that your visit is very timely. The Swiss Confederation currently heads the OSCE
.
We have already discussed matters related to the grave and tragic events in Ukraine. I know that you have proposals and ideas on how to find a way out of the situation that has emerged. We have made our position known too.
I am very pleased to see you. Let’s try to analyse the situation and look for solutions to this crisis. Welcome, Mr President.
President of Switzerland and Osce Chairperson-In-Office Didier Burkhalter
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. It is very important to have this opportunity for dialogue.
Dialogue is probably the main thing. We have had past opportunities to talk. This is the third time this year that we are holding discussions. We met previously during the Olympic Games in Sochi and also just before the decision on establishing a special monitoring mission.
I would very much like to discuss the proposed roadmap with you today, and to look at it in real detail if possible, in order to start its implementation.
