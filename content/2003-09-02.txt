President Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, esteemed colleagues, friends,
Let me once again wish you a sincere welcome to Moscow.
Throughout its history Russia has always had special relations with the Muslim and Arab worlds. Over a long period of recent history we have always looked on the Arab world, the Muslim world as being among our closest allies. This is a traditional line in Russian foreign policy and it emerged as the result of a whole range of economic, foreign policy and domestic political circumstances. Among our partners, Saudi Arabia is one of the states on which we place particular significance. Saudi Arabia is one of the recognised leaders of the Arab world.
We have just held far-reaching and substantial talks on all the issues of mutual interest to us. I would like to note the depth and detail of discussion present throughout these talks and the high degree of openness in our discussions of issues on the bilateral and international agendas.
Your Highness, your visit and the visit of your colleagues and members of the royal family will give a powerful and positive new impetus to the development of our bilateral relations.
