Expanded meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I support everything that Mr Khristenko [Board Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission] said here. The Eurasian Commission has done a great deal of work together with our partners from the Republic of Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. We are currently finalising our agreements with the President of Kyrgyzstan regarding our involvement in supporting the participation of Kyrgyzstan in its efforts to join the Eurasian Union.
I am very happy to hear that our colleagues in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan are approaching this seriously and pragmatically, primarily proceeding from their national interest of course. However, there is an obvious desire to reach the targets they have set, relying on our joint efforts. We will support and assist them on this path.
Thank you very much.
