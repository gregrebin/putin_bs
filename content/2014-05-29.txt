Speech at Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting in expanded format

Astana
Expanded meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I support everything that Mr Khristenko [Board Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission] said here. The Eurasian Commission has done a great deal of work together with our partners from the Republic of Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. We are currently finalising our agreements with the President of Kyrgyzstan regarding our involvement in supporting the participation of Kyrgyzstan in its efforts to join the Eurasian Union.
I am very happy to hear that our colleagues in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan are approaching this seriously and pragmatically, primarily proceeding from their national interest of course. However, there is an obvious desire to reach the targets they have set, relying on our joint efforts. We will support and assist them on this path.
Thank you very much.

With President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.
The two leaders discussed issues concerning the accession of Kyrgyzstan to the Eurasian Economic Union and current issues of bilateral cooperation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, we have already discussed in essence the ‘roadmap’ for Kyrgyzstan to join the Eurasian Union that was set up today. I am happy to note your intent to organise this work.
We know this will not be easy and will take significant effort on the part of experts of both the Eurasian Commission and your country. Nevertheless, we are ready to help, to see what else we can do to prepare the economy of Kyrgyzstan for joint work.
I believe that on the bilateral track things are developing as planned. I hope all our plans will be implemented.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Mr Putin, as you have said, if it were not for Russia’s support in a time of trial, we would have found many things more difficult.
We are making this decision with confidence and deliberately, because we know we have a friend standing by, that we will receive friendly support in resolving all the problems that may arise in the implementation of this decision.
