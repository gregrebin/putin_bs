President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
As you are aware, we have completed a very serious stage in negotiations with our Belarusian friends on the parameters of the future development of the Union State. Some matters concern the security of our countries in the rapidly changing world. This is why I propose we discuss this issue today.
