Speeches at the ceremony presenting the order
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Xi Jinping, ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honour to present the highest order of the Russian Federation – the Order of St Andrew the Apostle – to our dear friend, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
This is evidence of our recognition of your special services to the development of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between our states and also to the strengthening of friendship between our nations.
Mr Xi Jinping, my dear friend. You have always been a consistent advocate of close cooperation between Russia and China based on equality, trust, openness and respect for one another’s interests. Evidence of this attitude is the fact that Russia was the first foreign country you visited as the leader of China in 2013. Such friendly gestures are worth a great deal. We know this very well and appreciate it.
Since then, Russian-Chinese partnership has become even stronger and continues to develop intensively. It is notable that major bilateral projects in trade, the economy, defence, military technology, culture and other areas are underway with your personal assistance. Interaction between our countries has become visibly more active on the international stage.
Mr President, I wholeheartedly wish all the best, success, health and well-being to you and peace, stability and prosperity to the friendly Chinese people.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Mr Putin, dear friends,
I would like to express my gratitude to President Vladimir Putin for his warm words.
The President has bestowed the Order of St Andrew the Apostle on me. This is a great honour. I see this not only as a personal honour but also as evidence of our Russian partners’ attention to the development of Chinese-Russian relations and also as proof of the feeling of sincere friendship the Russian people have for the people of China. I would like to use this occasion to express my gratitude to President Putin personally and to the friendly Russian people.
This is probably the best period in the history of Chinese-Russian comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation. Our countries are working in the spirit of equality and trust, mutual support, prosperity and centuries-long friendship to strengthen mutual political trust and to promote the alignment of the Belt and Road initiative and the EAEU. By closely coordinating their actions on the international stage, the two sides are promoting their individual development and mutual prosperity. This provides a vital impetus and adds positive energy to the maintenance of peace and stability on the planet.
Mr Putin and I fully agree that Chinese-Russian relations must remain free of external influence despite any changes on the international stage.
We are resolved to expand mutual support and all-round ties and to promote our cooperation in the name of success to the benefit of our nations and the rest of the world. We feel confident about the development of Chinese-Russian relations.
I will revere this order as evidence of Chinese-Russian friendship. I will work firmly and consistently to strengthen and boost our comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Xi Jinping, friends,
It is inferred in such cases as this that this is evidence of our attention for and appreciation of Russian-Chinese relations and respect for the people of China. This is true. The awarding of this order is evidence of our attitude to China and the Chinese people.
I have known Mr Xi Jinping for many years. Of course, he is the leader of a great power and nation, but he has always been a modest person who preferred to say little about himself. However, I would like to highlight that it is this man who is in charge of the Chinese foreign policy. We have been working together, which is why I have first-hand information about his great personal contribution to the development of bilateral relations and the decisions he takes on key issues of Russian-Chinese relations. I want you to know that we highly appreciate this.
This order has been awarded to you in recognition of your personal contribution to the development of our relations. We are grateful to you for this.
Please, accept my congratulations again and also best wishes to you, your family and the Chinese people.

Meeting with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Chairman of Gazprom Management Board Alexei Miller. The Gazprom CEO briefed the President on the situation with provision of gas supply to the Russian regions and the company’s current operations.

Meeting with Chairman of Gazprom Management Board Alexei Miller.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Miller, let’s discuss the company’s performance so far this year.
The second issue is connected to Direct Line: There are a lot of problems related to provision of gas supply. These are traditional problems that people raise in the course of Direct Line, and we do not just discuss these things. I know that you have proposed specific solutions together with the regions: Gazprom cannot deal with this on its own, without the regions. Nevertheless, I would like to revisit the matter.
Chairman of Gazprom Management Board Alexei Miller: Mr President, in the first six months of 2017 Gazprom increased production by 36.2 billion cubic metres, year on year, or by 18.4 percent. This is related to growing gas consumption on the domestic market and it is noteworthy. Household gas consumption was up 4.6 percent; consumption in the power engineering sector, 9.5 percent; the agro-chemistry, 20.6 percent; metallurgy, 28.2 percent; total average growth, 11.2 billion or 9.7 percent. This clearly points to economic growth in these sectors.
Growing gas consumption in the household sector shows that issues related to provision of gas supply are, without a doubt, very important and significant and Gazprom continues implementing the programme to provide gas supply that we launched in keeping with your instruction in mid-2005.
This year, we are implementing the programme in 68 regions; 25.7 billion rubles have been disbursed. A total of 3,700 km of gas pipelines are under construction as part of this programme. This year, 1,700 km will be put into operation in 31 regions; 160 gas boilers will be built and 75,800 flats and households will be provided with gas services; pipeline gas will be provided to over 200 localities.
There are problems with some regions. We have 19 regions that regularly fail to fulfil the commitments they assumed under the scheduled synchronisation plans that we sign with them every year.
Vladimir Putin: They do not get it to the end consumer?
Alexei Miller: Right, after all, Gazprom is responsible for providing gas to the edge of a settlement. As for the distribution system in the settlement or within the building, or preparations for users to be connected, this is certainly the responsibility of the regions.
Based on the results of the past six months, Gazprom will have to consider how to redistribute funds in those regions that did not fulfil their commitments in the first half of the year and allocate additional funds to those regions that complied with their obligations.
On average, by the beginning of 2017 provision of gas supply reached 67.2 percent nationwide, 70.9 percent in cities and urban settlements and 57.1 percent in rural areas.
The amount of investment we allocate is bringing less and less gain every year because gas has to be supplied to more remote areas. However, I would like to point out that in 2017 we allocated considerable funds to regions like the Primorye Territory, considering the national policy on accelerated development of the Far East. Today the Primorye Territory is the biggest recipient of investment under the gas infrastructure development programme.
I would also like to note that we have established a good working dialogue with those regions that are led by new governors, acting governors. I would like to mention the Yaroslavl Region. We had a working meeting with the governor in Yaroslavl and mapped out very serious plans on provision of gas supply in the region. 
Naturally, Eastern Siberia is now playing a tangible role in our programme. I would also like to mention the Novosibirsk Region. We are allocating substantial funds to them. And I would also like to mention the Northwest – Karelia.
Probably, I should also mention a number of regions that regularly fail to comply with their commitments for various reasons. This applies to Daghestan and, regrettably, the Volgograd Region. These are the regions that chronically lag behind the obligations they assumed.
Gazprom is funding the programme in a consistent manner. In the first half of the year we earmarked exactly half of the funds that were provided for the programme. We plan to start service at all facilities by the beginning of the 2017–2018 autumn-winter season.

Beginning of meeting with President of China Xi Jinping
July 4, 2017

The Kremlin, Moscow
Meeting with President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am happy to welcome you in the Kremlin.
Yesterday, we had an informal but very intense and business-like meeting with President of China Xi Jinping in the Kremlin, the heart of Russia.
We view our meeting today and your official visit as a key event for the development of bilateral relations this year. I am glad to say that the growth of our mutual trade last year was modest at 3.9 percent, whereas this year it soared by 37 percent in the first four months.
We invariably have economic matters at the top of our agenda, but they are not the only issues we address. We also coordinate our efforts on the international stage, in the area of security and in the fight against modern threats and challenges. We are glad to have this opportunity to engage in an in-depth discussion of all aspects of our cooperation with you, Mr President, and all our Chinese friends in various formats.
Thank you.
President of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Mr President, my good friend! My dear Russian friends and colleagues!
I am happy to be able to make one more visit to Russia. Upon our arrival here yesterday, we were given a warm welcome and felt your genuine friendship and attention. We highly appreciate this friendship. I am deeply impressed.
Russia was the first country I visited as PRC President after my election in March 2013. Since then, I have visited Russia six times and attended international events here. We counted that the two of us have met 22 times over these years. Russia is the country that I visited the most, and among foreign leaders I maintain the closest contacts and ties with you. This is indicative of the high level and special nature of the relations between our two countries.
China and Russia are good neighbours that are connected by rivers and mountains. We are reliable friends always eager to help and support one another. In addition, we are reliable and good partners maintaining close and effective ties.
Our cooperation is underpinned by the core principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. This is an essential feature of the relations between our two countries as great powers.
Over the years, we have succeeded in many areas by acting together. I am looking forward to exchanging views with you on all relevant matters as part of this visit. I strongly believe that this visit will bring about new advances and will be a success.
On a personal note and on behalf of the entire delegation, I would like to once again thank you for the attention and hospitality demonstrated by the Russian Government.
Thank you!

Meeting with representatives of public organisations, business and media communities of Russia and China
Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met with representatives of public organisations, business and media communities of the two countries as part of the Chinese President’s official visit to Russia.
July 4, 2017
15:30
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to welcome all of you to the Kremlin. For the first time, Russian and Chinese entrepreneurs, representatives of public organisations and the media community, all those who are creating a foundation for cooperation between Russia and China in the economic, humanitarian, scientific and information areas, and making a real contribution to the consolidation of friendship and mutual understanding between our peoples and countries are meeting at a common venue.
We have just finished talks with President Xi Jinping. We have discussed in detail the status of bilateral ties and mapped out plans for the future. I must admit that the successful implementation of these plans depends not only on the performance of government bodies but also on the enthusiastic participation of the public and business circles and support from the media community. The Russian-Chinese Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development is playing a tangible role in this respect. Uniting politicians, entrepreneurs, heads of departments and regions, cultural figures, diplomats and journalists, the Committee has been a leading source of dialogue between China and Russia for 20 years now.
Over 100 major events in business, culture, innovation, sport, medicine and education, to name a few, were held under the Committee’s aegis in 2016. Another 180 initiatives have been planned for this year. We hope the Russian-Chinese Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development will continue fulfilling its important mission in the same creative and novel way – promote the consolidation of mutual understanding and good-neighbourly relations between our nations.
The China-Russia Friendship Association is very much involved in public diplomacy. It is the successor to the Soviet-China Friendship Association founded back in 1957 and for these 60 years it has been dedicated to strengthening friendly ties between the two peoples. The Association brings together those who value close relations with our great neighbours, who love and respects the rich legacy, history and culture of the Chinese people. Today the Association initiates and organises many large joint events and works hard to promote youth relations, and develop cooperation between Russian and Chinese regions.
I would particularly like to mention the activity of the Russia-China business councils and the Russian-Chinese Chamber for Facilitating Trade in Machinery and Innovative Products which help major companies and associations in our countries establish everyday contacts, fulfil their initiatives in non-commodity exports, mechanical engineering, technology transfer and innovation. The results include such signature projects as the Yamal LNG project, construction of the Trans-Baikal Grain Terminal, and the aluminium production facilities in the Henan province.
It is significant that this meeting is attended by representatives from the media and various media-related organisations from the two countries. They contribute greatly to building an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding, and strengthening the international positions of Russia and China. They report, promptly and efficiently, verified information on the politics, the economy and the history of our countries, the lives of Russian and Chinese citizens to the global community.
It is with your support that for the second year, a large inter-state project, the Year of the Russian and Chinese Media, successfully continues, with festivals, exhibitions, conferences and video linkups. We have also started joint film production. Today we gave a green light to a new modern animated television series featuring popular Russian and Chinese animated characters.
The Third Russia-China Media Forum is underway in Moscow. Over 120 top managers from the leading media in Russia and China are participating. I would like to mention one of the agreements prepared in time for the forum, which is an agreement to launch the Katyusha television channel in China this year. It will be the third Russian channel available to the Chinese audience.
Thank you very much for your work together. Thank you for your attention.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): President Putin, ladies and gentlemen,
I am really happy to have this meeting. First of all, let me send my sincere greetings to the friendly people of Russia, to welcome the China-Russia Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development, representatives of the Chinese and Russian media and business communities.
As they say, friendship gets stronger through constant communication. Russia is the country that I have visited most frequently since becoming the President of China. In recent years, China and Russia, as good neighbours, friends and reliable partners, have built exemplary relations between large neighbouring countries in the spirit of good neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation.
This long-term friendship and mutually beneficial partnership is not just the historical choice of the two peoples but an actual necessity for building an open and tolerant world, long-term peace and universal prosperity. Regardless of changes in external circumstances, our determination and commitment to developing China-Russia relations remain unwavering and unfailing.
Today, I see in the audience not only leading representatives of the traditional friendship between China and Russia but the young vanguard of the two countries’ brotherly cooperation. For many years, you have made strong efforts to consolidate the long-term friendship of our countries and promote business cooperation, which is a stable support in the development of the Chinese-Russian comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction.
This year, the China-Russia Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development marks 20 years. Over these 20 years, the committee, as the main channel of public contact between the two countries, has largely promoted cooperation in science, professional exchange, youth exchange, media, business, and between regions. The committee has achieved remarkable results in covering the ideas of the centennial friendship and strengthening of mutual understanding between Russia and China, and, therefore, contributed significantly to the full, stable and successful development of bilateral relations.
The China-Russia Friendship Association marks 60 years this year. For many years, the Association, in the spirit of friendship with China, has brought together a series of activists from different areas and unfailingly promoted Russian-Chinese cooperation in trade, the economy, science, technology, education, culture, youth and regional issues. It has been irreplaceable in strengthening the public foundation of our friendship.
The Year of the Russian and Chinese Media rounds out this year. Within this project, both parties have held over a hundred exciting events. Just recently, Moscow hosted the Third Russia-China Media Forum. Dialogues and contact between our media organisations constantly develop. All these efforts allow us to distribute information about our friendship and relations, improve understanding and links between our peoples, and increase the influence of our media at the international level.
Chinese-Russian trade has shown rapid growth in the first half of the year. Business cooperation is growing. Russia has already become China’s largest supplier of crude oil and electricity.
The construction of the gas pipeline on the eastern route and the Yamal-LNG project are moving ahead; investment and financial cooperation are expanding. We are stepping up our practical cooperation, which allows us to deepen our common interests and receive mutual benefits. I believe these achievements are closely linked with the meticulous work of Chinese and Russian entrepreneurs. I am convinced that with a common effort we will make our cooperation in this area more viable and dynamic.
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
Today, Chinese-Russian relations have entered the best period of their development. This is a result of the long-term efforts of both sides. As they say, “the more people put twigs into the fire, the brighter its flame.”
I rely on our common efforts to promote Chinese-Russian relations. I hope for your further efforts to advance our relations. I believe our relations not only benefit our peoples, but also enhance peace, stability and security all over the world. Mature and stable China-Russia relations meet not only the mood of the times but also the aspirations of our nations. We rely on your active work, your reason and your power.
I hope you will continue working to spread Chinese-Russian friendship. I believe that this is a great and long-term goal that has no end. I hope the Russia-China Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development, our Friendship Society and our media will use their unique advantages for consolidating contacts and cooperation between the public circles of the two countries, which will provide more positive energy for the opening of new horizons for our people’s diplomacy.
I hope for your further efforts to promote our practical cooperation. I see many points of contact in our development strategy. The Chinese people are consistently implementing their dream of the great revival of the Chinese nation. The Russian people are also rapidly moving forward on the road to the development and prosperity of their country. I hope you will strive for new successes in deepening practical cooperation between our countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
China and Russia are good neighbours united by common rivers and mountains. We have a common border of about 4,300 km. We have enormous, broad common interests. Let us work together in the spirit of the era to translate into life our dream of the happiness and welfare of our nations.
Thank you for your attention.
