Speeches at the ceremony presenting the order
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Xi Jinping, ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honour to present the highest order of the Russian Federation – the Order of St Andrew the Apostle – to our dear friend, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
This is evidence of our recognition of your special services to the development of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between our states and also to the strengthening of friendship between our nations.
Mr Xi Jinping, my dear friend. You have always been a consistent advocate of close cooperation between Russia and China based on equality, trust, openness and respect for one another’s interests. Evidence of this attitude is the fact that Russia was the first foreign country you visited as the leader of China in 2013. Such friendly gestures are worth a great deal. We know this very well and appreciate it.
Since then, Russian-Chinese partnership has become even stronger and continues to develop intensively. It is notable that major bilateral projects in trade, the economy, defence, military technology, culture and other areas are underway with your personal assistance. Interaction between our countries has become visibly more active on the international stage.
Mr President, I wholeheartedly wish all the best, success, health and well-being to you and peace, stability and prosperity to the friendly Chinese people.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Mr Putin, dear friends,
I would like to express my gratitude to President Vladimir Putin for his warm words.
The President has bestowed the Order of St Andrew the Apostle on me. This is a great honour. I see this not only as a personal honour but also as evidence of our Russian partners’ attention to the development of Chinese-Russian relations and also as proof of the feeling of sincere friendship the Russian people have for the people of China. I would like to use this occasion to express my gratitude to President Putin personally and to the friendly Russian people.
This is probably the best period in the history of Chinese-Russian comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation. Our countries are working in the spirit of equality and trust, mutual support, prosperity and centuries-long friendship to strengthen mutual political trust and to promote the alignment of the Belt and Road initiative and the EAEU. By closely coordinating their actions on the international stage, the two sides are promoting their individual development and mutual prosperity. This provides a vital impetus and adds positive energy to the maintenance of peace and stability on the planet.
Mr Putin and I fully agree that Chinese-Russian relations must remain free of external influence despite any changes on the international stage.
We are resolved to expand mutual support and all-round ties and to promote our cooperation in the name of success to the benefit of our nations and the rest of the world. We feel confident about the development of Chinese-Russian relations.
I will revere this order as evidence of Chinese-Russian friendship. I will work firmly and consistently to strengthen and boost our comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Xi Jinping, friends,
It is inferred in such cases as this that this is evidence of our attention for and appreciation of Russian-Chinese relations and respect for the people of China. This is true. The awarding of this order is evidence of our attitude to China and the Chinese people.
I have known Mr Xi Jinping for many years. Of course, he is the leader of a great power and nation, but he has always been a modest person who preferred to say little about himself. However, I would like to highlight that it is this man who is in charge of the Chinese foreign policy. We have been working together, which is why I have first-hand information about his great personal contribution to the development of bilateral relations and the decisions he takes on key issues of Russian-Chinese relations. I want you to know that we highly appreciate this.
This order has been awarded to you in recognition of your personal contribution to the development of our relations. We are grateful to you for this.
Please, accept my congratulations again and also best wishes to you, your family and the Chinese people.

Meeting with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller
Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Chairman of Gazprom Management Board Alexei Miller. The Gazprom CEO briefed the President on the situation with provision of gas supply to the Russian regions and the company’s current operations.

Meeting with Chairman of Gazprom Management Board Alexei Miller.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Miller, let’s discuss the company’s performance so far this year.
The second issue is connected to Direct Line: There are a lot of problems related to provision of gas supply. These are traditional problems that people raise in the course of Direct Line, and we do not just discuss these things. I know that you have proposed specific solutions together with the regions: Gazprom cannot deal with this on its own, without the regions. Nevertheless, I would like to revisit the matter.
Chairman of Gazprom Management Board Alexei Miller: Mr President, in the first six months of 2017 Gazprom increased production by 36.2 billion cubic metres, year on year, or by 18.4 percent. This is related to growing gas consumption on the domestic market and it is noteworthy. Household gas consumption was up 4.6 percent; consumption in the power engineering sector, 9.5 percent; the agro-chemistry, 20.6 percent; metallurgy, 28.2 percent; total average growth, 11.2 billion or 9.7 percent. This clearly points to economic growth in these sectors.
Growing gas consumption in the household sector shows that issues related to provision of gas supply are, without a doubt, very important and significant and Gazprom continues implementing the programme to provide gas supply that we launched in keeping with your instruction in mid-2005.
This year, we are implementing the programme in 68 regions; 25.7 billion rubles have been disbursed. A total of 3,700 km of gas pipelines are under construction as part of this programme. This year, 1,700 km will be put into operation in 31 regions; 160 gas boilers will be built and 75,800 flats and households will be provided with gas services; pipeline gas will be provided to over 200 localities.
There are problems with some regions. We have 19 regions that regularly fail to fulfil the commitments they assumed under the scheduled synchronisation plans that we sign with them every year.
Vladimir Putin: They do not get it to the end consumer?
Alexei Miller: Right, after all, Gazprom is responsible for providing gas to the edge of a settlement. As for the distribution system in the settlement or within the building, or preparations for users to be connected, this is certainly the responsibility of the regions.
Based on the results of the past six months, Gazprom will have to consider how to redistribute funds in those regions that did not fulfil their commitments in the first half of the year and allocate additional funds to those regions that complied with their obligations.
On average, by the beginning of 2017 provision of gas supply reached 67.2 percent nationwide, 70.9 percent in cities and urban settlements and 57.1 percent in rural areas.
The amount of investment we allocate is bringing less and less gain every year because gas has to be supplied to more remote areas. However, I would like to point out that in 2017 we allocated considerable funds to regions like the Primorye Territory, considering the national policy on accelerated development of the Far East. Today the Primorye Territory is the biggest recipient of investment under the gas infrastructure development programme.
I would also like to note that we have established a good working dialogue with those regions that are led by new governors, acting governors. I would like to mention the Yaroslavl Region. We had a working meeting with the governor in Yaroslavl and mapped out very serious plans on provision of gas supply in the region. 
Naturally, Eastern Siberia is now playing a tangible role in our programme. I would also like to mention the Novosibirsk Region. We are allocating substantial funds to them. And I would also like to mention the Northwest – Karelia.
Probably, I should also mention a number of regions that regularly fail to comply with their commitments for various reasons. This applies to Daghestan and, regrettably, the Volgograd Region. These are the regions that chronically lag behind the obligations they assumed.
Gazprom is funding the programme in a consistent manner. In the first half of the year we earmarked exactly half of the funds that were provided for the programme. We plan to start service at all facilities by the beginning of the 2017–2018 autumn-winter season.

Beginning of meeting with President of China Xi Jinping
July 4, 2017
12:30
The Kremlin, Moscow
Meeting with President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am happy to welcome you in the Kremlin.
Yesterday, we had an informal but very intense and business-like meeting with President of China Xi Jinping in the Kremlin, the heart of Russia.
We view our meeting today and your official visit as a key event for the development of bilateral relations this year. I am glad to say that the growth of our mutual trade last year was modest at 3.9 percent, whereas this year it soared by 37 percent in the first four months.
We invariably have economic matters at the top of our agenda, but they are not the only issues we address. We also coordinate our efforts on the international stage, in the area of security and in the fight against modern threats and challenges. We are glad to have this opportunity to engage in an in-depth discussion of all aspects of our cooperation with you, Mr President, and all our Chinese friends in various formats.
Thank you.
President of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Mr President, my good friend! My dear Russian friends and colleagues!
I am happy to be able to make one more visit to Russia. Upon our arrival here yesterday, we were given a warm welcome and felt your genuine friendship and attention. We highly appreciate this friendship. I am deeply impressed.
Russia was the first country I visited as PRC President after my election in March 2013. Since then, I have visited Russia six times and attended international events here. We counted that the two of us have met 22 times over these years. Russia is the country that I visited the most, and among foreign leaders I maintain the closest contacts and ties with you. This is indicative of the high level and special nature of the relations between our two countries.
China and Russia are good neighbours that are connected by rivers and mountains. We are reliable friends always eager to help and support one another. In addition, we are reliable and good partners maintaining close and effective ties.
Our cooperation is underpinned by the core principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. This is an essential feature of the relations between our two countries as great powers.
Over the years, we have succeeded in many areas by acting together. I am looking forward to exchanging views with you on all relevant matters as part of this visit. I strongly believe that this visit will bring about new advances and will be a success.
On a personal note and on behalf of the entire delegation, I would like to once again thank you for the attention and hospitality demonstrated by the Russian Government.
Thank you!

Meeting with representatives of public organisations, business and media communities of Russia and China
Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met with representatives of public organisations, business and media communities of the two countries as part of the Chinese President’s official visit to Russia.
July 4, 2017
15:30
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to welcome all of you to the Kremlin. For the first time, Russian and Chinese entrepreneurs, representatives of public organisations and the media community, all those who are creating a foundation for cooperation between Russia and China in the economic, humanitarian, scientific and information areas, and making a real contribution to the consolidation of friendship and mutual understanding between our peoples and countries are meeting at a common venue.
We have just finished talks with President Xi Jinping. We have discussed in detail the status of bilateral ties and mapped out plans for the future. I must admit that the successful implementation of these plans depends not only on the performance of government bodies but also on the enthusiastic participation of the public and business circles and support from the media community. The Russian-Chinese Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development is playing a tangible role in this respect. Uniting politicians, entrepreneurs, heads of departments and regions, cultural figures, diplomats and journalists, the Committee has been a leading source of dialogue between China and Russia for 20 years now.
Over 100 major events in business, culture, innovation, sport, medicine and education, to name a few, were held under the Committee’s aegis in 2016. Another 180 initiatives have been planned for this year. We hope the Russian-Chinese Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development will continue fulfilling its important mission in the same creative and novel way – promote the consolidation of mutual understanding and good-neighbourly relations between our nations.
The China-Russia Friendship Association is very much involved in public diplomacy. It is the successor to the Soviet-China Friendship Association founded back in 1957 and for these 60 years it has been dedicated to strengthening friendly ties between the two peoples. The Association brings together those who value close relations with our great neighbours, who love and respects the rich legacy, history and culture of the Chinese people. Today the Association initiates and organises many large joint events and works hard to promote youth relations, and develop cooperation between Russian and Chinese regions.
I would particularly like to mention the activity of the Russia-China business councils and the Russian-Chinese Chamber for Facilitating Trade in Machinery and Innovative Products which help major companies and associations in our countries establish everyday contacts, fulfil their initiatives in non-commodity exports, mechanical engineering, technology transfer and innovation. The results include such signature projects as the Yamal LNG project, construction of the Trans-Baikal Grain Terminal, and the aluminium production facilities in the Henan province.
It is significant that this meeting is attended by representatives from the media and various media-related organisations from the two countries. They contribute greatly to building an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding, and strengthening the international positions of Russia and China. They report, promptly and efficiently, verified information on the politics, the economy and the history of our countries, the lives of Russian and Chinese citizens to the global community.
It is with your support that for the second year, a large inter-state project, the Year of the Russian and Chinese Media, successfully continues, with festivals, exhibitions, conferences and video linkups. We have also started joint film production. Today we gave a green light to a new modern animated television series featuring popular Russian and Chinese animated characters.
The Third Russia-China Media Forum is underway in Moscow. Over 120 top managers from the leading media in Russia and China are participating. I would like to mention one of the agreements prepared in time for the forum, which is an agreement to launch the Katyusha television channel in China this year. It will be the third Russian channel available to the Chinese audience.
Thank you very much for your work together. Thank you for your attention.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): President Putin, ladies and gentlemen,
I am really happy to have this meeting. First of all, let me send my sincere greetings to the friendly people of Russia, to welcome the China-Russia Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development, representatives of the Chinese and Russian media and business communities.
As they say, friendship gets stronger through constant communication. Russia is the country that I have visited most frequently since becoming the President of China. In recent years, China and Russia, as good neighbours, friends and reliable partners, have built exemplary relations between large neighbouring countries in the spirit of good neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation.
This long-term friendship and mutually beneficial partnership is not just the historical choice of the two peoples but an actual necessity for building an open and tolerant world, long-term peace and universal prosperity. Regardless of changes in external circumstances, our determination and commitment to developing China-Russia relations remain unwavering and unfailing.
Today, I see in the audience not only leading representatives of the traditional friendship between China and Russia but the young vanguard of the two countries’ brotherly cooperation. For many years, you have made strong efforts to consolidate the long-term friendship of our countries and promote business cooperation, which is a stable support in the development of the Chinese-Russian comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction.
This year, the China-Russia Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development marks 20 years. Over these 20 years, the committee, as the main channel of public contact between the two countries, has largely promoted cooperation in science, professional exchange, youth exchange, media, business, and between regions. The committee has achieved remarkable results in covering the ideas of the centennial friendship and strengthening of mutual understanding between Russia and China, and, therefore, contributed significantly to the full, stable and successful development of bilateral relations.
The China-Russia Friendship Association marks 60 years this year. For many years, the Association, in the spirit of friendship with China, has brought together a series of activists from different areas and unfailingly promoted Russian-Chinese cooperation in trade, the economy, science, technology, education, culture, youth and regional issues. It has been irreplaceable in strengthening the public foundation of our friendship.
The Year of the Russian and Chinese Media rounds out this year. Within this project, both parties have held over a hundred exciting events. Just recently, Moscow hosted the Third Russia-China Media Forum. Dialogues and contact between our media organisations constantly develop. All these efforts allow us to distribute information about our friendship and relations, improve understanding and links between our peoples, and increase the influence of our media at the international level.
Chinese-Russian trade has shown rapid growth in the first half of the year. Business cooperation is growing. Russia has already become China’s largest supplier of crude oil and electricity.
The construction of the gas pipeline on the eastern route and the Yamal-LNG project are moving ahead; investment and financial cooperation are expanding. We are stepping up our practical cooperation, which allows us to deepen our common interests and receive mutual benefits. I believe these achievements are closely linked with the meticulous work of Chinese and Russian entrepreneurs. I am convinced that with a common effort we will make our cooperation in this area more viable and dynamic.
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
Today, Chinese-Russian relations have entered the best period of their development. This is a result of the long-term efforts of both sides. As they say, “the more people put twigs into the fire, the brighter its flame.”
I rely on our common efforts to promote Chinese-Russian relations. I hope for your further efforts to advance our relations. I believe our relations not only benefit our peoples, but also enhance peace, stability and security all over the world. Mature and stable China-Russia relations meet not only the mood of the times but also the aspirations of our nations. We rely on your active work, your reason and your power.
I hope you will continue working to spread Chinese-Russian friendship. I believe that this is a great and long-term goal that has no end. I hope the Russia-China Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development, our Friendship Society and our media will use their unique advantages for consolidating contacts and cooperation between the public circles of the two countries, which will provide more positive energy for the opening of new horizons for our people’s diplomacy.
I hope for your further efforts to promote our practical cooperation. I see many points of contact in our development strategy. The Chinese people are consistently implementing their dream of the great revival of the Chinese nation. The Russian people are also rapidly moving forward on the road to the development and prosperity of their country. I hope you will strive for new successes in deepening practical cooperation between our countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
China and Russia are good neighbours united by common rivers and mountains. We have a common border of about 4,300 km. We have enormous, broad common interests. Let us work together in the spirit of the era to translate into life our dream of the happiness and welfare of our nations.
Thank you for your attention.

Russian-Chinese talks in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, Chinese friends,
I would like to extend my welcome to you once again, now that the two delegations meet in the expanded format.
In fact, we started our work yesterday evening. Today, we had an opportunity to meet in a restricted format to review all areas on the bilateral agenda, including political cooperation, international affairs, economic, military, military-technical, and cultural cooperation.
Since we are now meeting in an expanded format, we can hear from our colleagues, ministers and deputy prime ministers, in order to discuss in greater detail all the matters of mutual interest.
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you once again. Welcome!
President of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): Mr President, Russian friends,
I would like to thank all of you once again, and specifically President Putin, for inviting us to Russia.
Thank you for decorating me with the Order of St Andrew the Apostle.
As you have said, we had a very insightful conversation yesterday, and agreed on a number of new issues. We have been maintaining close contact since the beginning of this year. In May, you attended the Belt and Road International Forum in China. Last month, we were both present at the SCO Summit in Astana. After this visit, we will meet on a number of other platforms.
I believe that our proactive contacts served as an impetus for stepping up the comprehensive partnership and high-level strategic cooperation between China and Russia.
We have been firm in supporting each other on matters related to our vital interests, and are making progress in aligning the Belt and Road Initiative with the EAEU.
Our cooperation is making steady progress in terms of investment, energy, humanitarian and inter-regional cooperation. We cooperate effectively on international and regional issues. Not only did our strategic partnership facilitate development in our countries, but also added positive and meaningful momentum to efforts aimed at sustaining peace and security across the world, and had a stabilising effect in the rapidly changing world.
These are challenging times in terms of international affairs, where we are facing opportunities, as well as challenges. Against this backdrop, I believe that we should combine our efforts in order to overcome these challenges and strengthen our relations.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.

Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping make press statements following the talks.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President Xi Jinping, ladies and gentlemen,
The official visit to Russia by President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping is certainly the central event of this year in relations between our states.
Yesterday Mr Xi Jinping and I had an informal meeting and candidly exchanged views on the most important issues of bilateral cooperation. Today we held intensive talks that included members of the Government and the chief executives of major companies. We arrived at the common opinion that the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership has acquired impressive dynamics in almost all areas.
I would like to emphasise that much of the credit for this goes to Mr Xi Jinping. He was awarded the Order of St Andrew the Apostle in recognition of his personal contribution to the consolidation of friendship between the peoples of Russia and China. As you have seen, I was pleased to present this highest state award of the Russian Federation to our friend in the Kremlin today.

Russian-Chinese talks
July 4, 2017
During our conversations, we reviewed an entire range of issues regarding Russian-Chinese relations and reached important agreements on the further promotion of bilateral ties in many diverse areas.
We conducted an in-depth discussion of economic cooperation, pointing out, in particular, that trade continued to grow this year as it did last year. In 2016 trade increased by 4 percent to $66 billion, while in the four months of this year it went up by a substantial 37 percent or $24.5 billion.
Our priority area of cooperation is energy. Russia is a leading oil supplier to China. In 2016, Russia exported 27.3 million tonnes under inter-governmental agreements alone. Total exports, including commercial contracts, amount to 52.5 million tonnes.
Construction of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline continues on schedule. Let me remind you that this pipeline will transport 38 billion cubic metres of gas over 30 years. As you saw, top executives of Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corporation have just signed a supplementary agreement on the first natural gas supplies in December 2019. The parameters of the western route have yet to be agreed on.
Construction of the Yamal LNG production facility is in the final stages. A significant interest of 29.9 percent in this project belongs to our Chinese partners. As of today, the plant is 90 percent complete and is scheduled for launch at the end of this year.
Let me note the successful construction of the first unit of the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant. Next year, two more units will become operational. We have agreed to continue close cooperation in the nuclear power industry.
Today we particularly focused on high-tech industries – primarily, joint space exploration. We are working on the next space programme for 2018–2022.
Successful joint projects in aviation include the design of a new long-haul aircraft and a civilian heavy helicopter. As concerns transportation, we are developing a high-speed railway project between Moscow and Kazan and discussing the localization of rolling stock manufacturing in Russia.
Another transport project is the construction of the Western Europe – Western China motorway. The Russian section is scheduled for completion in 2019.
We see big potential in the join use of the Northern Sea Route and the Trans-Siberian and Baikal-Amur railways. This is largely in tune with our Chinese partners' initiatives discussed during the recent The Belt and Road international forum in China. The initiative of the Chinese leader deserves the closest attention and will be supported by Russia in every possible way.
I am confident that these large-scale projects will result in intensive trade, modern production and jobs and the rapid development of Russian and Chinese regions. We have set ourselves the task of more actively developing the credit and financial sphere and cooperation in this field. Last year, by the way, cumulative direct capital investment from China increased 12 percent to $2.3 billion.
We backed the agreement between the Russian Direct Investment Fund and the China Development Bank to create a joint investment fund with 65 billion yuan. We agreed to continue consultations on the wider use of our national currencies in mutual transactions and in investment. I am sure that this will promote the opening in China of the first foreign office of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
We see significant opportunities in agricultural cooperation. Last year, the volume of Russian agricultural exports grew 17 percent to $1.6 billion.
In addition, a decision has been adopted to increase Russian wheat imports. A document on access to other crops for the Chinese market is currently being finalised. We also discussed the issue of lifting restrictions on the import of Russian meat and poultry products by China.
We held an in-depth exchange of opinions on joining the activity of the Eurasian Economic Union with the Chinese initiative of the Silk Road Economic Belt. This is a highly promising direction, putting collective effort in line with our idea to form a broad Eurasian partnership.
Other important issues were also addressed during the talks, particularly humanitarian contacts.
We discussed further plans in detail during the meeting Mr Xi Jinping and I had with representatives of the two countries' general public, business and media communities. We noted the successful implementation of the new ambitious project of exchange years of the Russian and Chinese media.
The regular [China-Russia] Media Forum is timed to coincide with Mr Xi Jinping's visit. The main result of this forum was an agreement on launching Katyusha, our third cultural and educational television channel in China. An agreement on film production was prepared for signing. There is also some good experience in animation production.
We intend to further reinforce our scientific and education ties. As of today, some 25,000 Chinese nationals are studying in Russia, and 17,000 Russian students are studying in China. By 2020, education exchanges are expected to reach 100,000 people.
Starting as early as September, the first joint Russian-Chinese University in Shenzhen, established with assistance from Moscow State University and the Beijing Institute of Technology, will begin accepting its first students. In the long term, the university will take up to 5,000 students.
We also noted a positive dynamic in the tourism industry. Chinese citizens are Russia's biggest group of incoming tourists. In 2016, the number increased to 30 percent, or 1.28 million people. China has become the second most popular destination for Russian tourists, which also indicated considerable growth at 30 percent.
Of course, particular attention was paid to international political issues during the talks. Russia and China actively interact on the international arena. We have agreed with Mr Xi Jinping to boost cooperation in various multilateral formats, in particular, at the UN, the SCO and the G20, which was reflected in our joint statement.
In two days, together with Chinese President Xi Jinping, we will take part in the G20 summit in Hamburg. By tradition we will hold a meeting of BRICS leaders there as well. As you know, this year China holds the presidency in this association and will host the official summit in Xiamen in September.
Our common foreign policy priorities include a comprehensive resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue with a view to ensuring peace and stability in Northeast Asia. We have agreed to actively promote our common initiative based on Russia’s stage-by-stage plan for a Korean settlement and China’s initiatives for a parallel freeze of nuclear missile activities in the PDRK and the large-scale military exercises by the United States and the Republic of Korea.
We exchanged views on the Syrian crisis and other outstanding issues. We discussed the prospects for implementing the agreements on Iran’s nuclear programme.
To sum up, Russia and China really have very close or identical opinions on all major international issues. We intend to continue developing our foreign policy coordination.
In general, today’s talks will further develop the genuinely friendly relations between Russia and China.
I would like to thank our Chinese friends for an open and useful dialogue, once again. I would also like to convey my gratitude to our friend, President Xi Jinping.
Thank you for your attention.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Mr President Putin, Russian colleagues, representatives of the media, good afternoon. I am very happy to meet you with my good friend President Putin.
This is my sixth visit to Russia after assuming office as China’s President in March 2013. We have just held our third meeting this year with President Putin, exchanged views on bilateral relations, and a number of major international and regional issues and reached extensive agreements.
It is a great honour for me to be awarded the Order of St Andrew, I will treasure it and consider it a symbol of your deep feelings of friendship for the Chinese nation.
Today, we have signed and published a Joint Statement of the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the Further Expansion of Comprehensive Partnership and Strategic Cooperation, as well as a Joint Statement on the Current Status of Global Affairs and Important International Issues, and we have approved the Action Plan to Implement the Provisions of the Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation for 2017–2020.
Our foreign ministers signed joint statements by the two countries' ministries on the Korean Peninsula issue. The corresponding departments and business entities have signed a number of cooperation agreements. We can say this visit has been productive and has given new impetus to the development of Chinese-Russian comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.
Mr Putin and I share the view that today Chinese-Russian relations are the best they have ever been. Whatever the changes in the international situation, our determination and confidence in developing and deepening our strategic partnership remains unwavering. We will further view our bilateral relations as a priority in our foreign policy and further provide mutual support on issues related to the vital interests of our countries, actively promote multifaceted cooperation to make our relations, which are developing at a high level, become an engine for the development and revival of our countries and a cornerstone for preserving global peace and stability.
We are happy to note that this year, our joint efforts in our diverse cooperation have resulted in a strong growth dynamic. In the first five months of this year, mutual trade reached $32.4 billion, which is up 26.1 percent compared to corresponding period last year.
China remains Russia's biggest trade partner. Our trade parameters are continuously improving. Progress is being made in a significant number of strategic projects including energy, investment, space, aviation and transport infrastructure. We are developing our coordination of the One Belt, One Road initiative and in the EAEU, and we promote development and prosperity on the Eurasian continent. All these rewarding achievements have both benefited our own economic development and helped revive the global economy as a whole.
Our humanitarian contacts, too, have been developing rapidly in recent years. For example, we conduct events within the framework of our national exchange years, language years, tourism years and also the years of youth exchanges. This year, we successfully conducted our mass media years.
Our mutual trips have become more intensive and more convenient. The number of people learning from each other, and visiting each other as tourists has increased significantly. Our joint university in Shenzhen will admit its first applicants this year.
This year marks 20 years of the China-Russia Committee of Friendship, Peace and Development and 60 years since the creation of the China-Russia Friendship Association. I am confident that both sides will do everything possible to strengthen the public and people’s foundations of Chinese-Russian relations.
President Putin and I, we wholeheartedly agree that the present world is disquieting, local conflicts and wars appear continuously. As before, issues like the Korean Peninsula and Syria remain complicated.
We are determined to bolster coordination and cooperation with Russia in international affairs together with the international community, step up efforts to optimise the global governance system to maintain strategic balance and stability throughout the world in order to jointly overcome global threats and challenges such as terrorism, to work together to encourage the process of resolving conflicts in hot spots through political means and in order to form a new type of interstate relations based on cooperation and mutual benefit.
President Putin and I will participate in the G20 summit in Hamburg. China and Russia, as two of the world's leading economies, favour a more open global economy. We will strengthen our coordination and will cooperate within the G20 framework with a view to promoting global economic growth.
President Putin and I are ready to maintain close contact and fully use the governing role of our contacts in a strategic way for the development of Chinese-Russian relations.
I invite President Putin to come to China this September for the BRICS summit to continue our friendly and deep contacts.
Thank you for your attention.
