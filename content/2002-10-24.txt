The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: A monstrous terrorist attack was made in Moscow last night. I know that the Moscow Mayor visited the site, saw it all with his own eyes and took part in the emergency headquarters’ work.
I must say that Moscow is an open city, just as the whole Russia is open. Terrorists are surely provoking us to introduce into our country the patterns they introduced in Chechnya in their time. We shall not succumb to those provocations.
Now, we must focus our efforts on one thing—to guarantee the safety of the area round the site of the attack, help the hostages and support their relatives. To help the people is what matters most.
