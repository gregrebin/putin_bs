Vladimir Putin : Dear Nursultan Abishevich! Dear Colleagues!
I am pleased to see that our visit to Kazakhstan is taking place during an anniversary year for our countries. In October we will celebrate a landmark date: the fifteenth anniversary of establishing our diplomatic relations. Since then we have significantly improved our strategic partnership, established close and genuinely allied relations in nearly all essential areas of cooperation.
<…>
Trade and economic relations are our priority now. Our volume of trade is constantly increasing. Last year it represented a significant amount: 13 billion USD. Our trade grew by almost 40 percent in the first few months of 2007. These high growth rates were, in many respects, due to active interregional and border cooperation.
<…>
Overall, we are pleased with the development of our joint work in the fuel and energy sector. Leading Russian companies such as Gazprom and Lukoil have already been working in Kazakhstan for a long time. We should accelerate the process of preparing a long-term fifteen-year agreement in order to successfully launch a joint venture involving the Orenburg gas processing plant. And we also talked about this with Nursultan Abishevich today. There are technological problems that we must resolve but I have every reason to believe that there are no insurmountable obstacles — everything can be resolved. I hope that our work will enable us to make additional steps forward.
Our agreements on cooperation in using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes are consistently being implemented. Today we plan to sign an intergovernmental agreement on establishing an International Uranium Enrichment Centre. We consider that this document represents the first step towards implementing our initiatives to establish global infrastructure for nuclear power. This is an important issue and today we paid quite a bit of attention to it. This is a very promising area of cooperation and I am confident that it will benefit both Kazakhstan’s and the Russian Federation’s economy.
Another important project in this field consists in creating a joint venture to develop innovative projects involving energy units with small- and medium-sized nuclear reactors. This project can be implemented on the site of an atomic energy combine in Kazakhstan. We are ready to participate in constructing nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan. I am sure that our experts will be discussing this project today. It is important to continue work on a programme to establish a common market for electricity in Russia and Kazakhstan so that we can begin implementing it in the near future. To this end we need to accelerate negotiations on the corresponding action plan.
Cooperation in the banking sector is increasing. Quite soon from now, 15 June 2007, the Eurasian Development Bank that was established at the initiative of the President of Kazakhstan will start functioning. The bank’s first projects — financing uranium and chromite extraction in Kazakhstan as well as the programme for the technological modernisation of the Ekibastuzskaia GES-2 power plant — have begun. All of this represents positive tendencies but we expect even better results from the bank in the future. I hope that these are just the first steps. Of course, it will be hard for the bank to realise alone the ambitious integration plans we have set before it, especially since it must take action in a difficult competitive environment. The bank will obviously need strong support from its founders — from Russia and from Kazakhstan.
In addition, we are witnessing active cooperation on a bilateral level between Vnesheconombank and the Development Bank of Kazakhstan and within the inter-bank association of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Promising projects include the development of the wood processing sector. We intend to further support cooperation between the governmental development institutes of Russia and Kazakhstan. In reference to this I would like to point out that since the transformation [of Vnesheconombank] into the Russian Development Bank, such cooperation benefits from more possibilities.
Cooperation in the aluminum sector has very good prospects. The merged company Russian Aluminum is the world leader in this field (or at least until the hostile takeover that an American company planned for its Canadian competitors) and is working on a major infrastructure project involving assets in Kazakhstan. We are counting on your support, my dear colleagues and dear Mr President, as we realize these projects.
We need to expand our joint work designed to improve cooperation in transportation. We paid quite a bit of attention to this issue today. This involves tariffs that apply to transporting goods, sorting out the property relations between the railways of Kazakhstan and Russia, and developing all Eurasian transport corridors.

Excerpts from Joint Press Conference with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev following Russian-Kazakhstan Talks

Astana
<…>
President Vladimir Putin:
First of all, I would like to thank the President of Kazakhstan and all our Kazakh colleagues for their very warm and hospitable welcome.
Yesterday, the peoples of Kazakhstan and Russia, along with people in many other countries, celebrated the 62nd anniversary of the great victory in the Second World War. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate all war veterans and all the people of Kazakhstan on this important occasion.
Today, Nursultan Abishevich [Nazarbayev] and I examined our bilateral cooperation in all its different aspects. We set the priorities for our work together to consolidate the strategic partnership between Russia and Kazakhstan and give it substance in the form of concrete projects and action. The key issues we discussed include developing our economic ties, space exploration and new forms of military-technical cooperation.
We paid particular attention to the fuel and energy sector and nuclear energy. I note that we also signed today agreements on establishing the International Uranium Enrichment Centre and on opening trade representation offices. Today we adopted a bilateral cooperation action plan for 2007–2008, which sets out a whole package of priority measures for building on our bilateral cooperation and creates a good foundation for comprehensive development of the integration processes we are pursuing.
A whole number of important documents are ready now for signature. They include, in particular, agreements on joint use of the Baikonur space launch centre, on improving the transport and energy infrastructure, and on simplifying border crossing procedures at the Russian-Kazakh border.
<…>
Work is continuing on drawing up the international-legal basis for our multilateral agreements on the Caspian Sea. We have also agreed to intensify our work on environmental issues, which have become particularly important of late, and will sign relevant agreements in this area at the earliest date.
<…>
Question: What can you add about the agreements concluded in the fuel and energy sector? You are no doubt aware that your meeting today, and the talks scheduled to take place in Ashgabat and Turkmenbashi, are drawing a lot of attention from around the world.
Vladimir Putin: It is natural enough that our talks in this area should attract heightened attention. This is understandable given that both Kazakhstan and Russia are prominent and significant players on the world energy markets. There are many dimensions to our energy-sector cooperation with Kazakhstan. It is not limited to the oil and gas sectors, though this is, of course, an important component of our energy cooperation.
We have just been informed that Gazprom and the according organisations in Kazakhstan have reached an agreement on future joint work. This is very good news and we hope to see another agreement signed in the next few hours.
We also cooperate in the electricity sector and we are continuing to work on the matter of joint electricity markets.
Regarding our cooperation in the oil sector, the President of Kazakhstan raised the question today of increasing the possibilities of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. We are reflecting on this matter and consider it possible, all the more so as we have already agreed on the construction of a new pipeline system, the Burgas-Alexandropoulis pipeline. A considerable share of the oil that will flow through this new pipeline could come from Kazakhstan.
We discussed nuclear energy and today, as you know, we signed an important agreement in this area (which I just mentioned). But our plans for the nuclear energy sector do not stop here. This sector, which is of vital importance to both Kazakhstan and Russia, offers very promising and important opportunities for work together and I know for a fact that our specialists will be meeting over these coming days to hold serious and active consultations on expanding our cooperation in this area. These talks will cover the construction of new nuclear power plants and joining forces to work on third-country markets. This is an area of cooperation with excellent prospects.
Regarding our possible trilateral agreements in Turkmenistan, I ask you please to be patient. We first need to hold the necessary consultations with our friends and colleagues in Turkmenistan. I am very hopeful that we will reach serious agreements, and when this takes place, we will let you know.
<…>
Question: You said that the space sector was one of the key cooperation issues discussed today. I am interested to know about the situation with unresolved social issues in the town of Baikonur. Did you discuss this matter today?
<…>
Vladimir Putin:
<…>
Baikonur’s future has been settled overall through to 2050, and the relevant agreements have been signed. I think it is clear to everyone that Baikonur is an immensely important treasure that Kazakhstan inherited when the Soviet Union’s assets were divided up. We are watching Kazakhstan’s economic growth closely and with satisfaction, and I want to congratulate all the people of Kazakhstan, and above all the President, on the country’s economic achievements, but even as wealthy a country as Kazakhstan is not in a position to erect such a centre as Baikonur. In order not to lose this precious asset, we have to use it together, of course. All specialists understand this. As for social issues, I think that we will be able to resolve all problems through our consultations.
