President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today is a special, remarkable, and festive day.
But now I suggest we focus on the work issues and problems that require a solution. We will discuss further steps to ensure the social and economic development of Crimea and Sevastopol, and will talk in detail about the issues that you need to deal with.
You know, I have just met with members of the public in Crimea and Sevastopol. There is no doubt that our task is to listen and respond to the citizens’ requests and initiatives at all times. We must do it all across Russia, in each republic, region, city and village. This fully applies to the Crimean Peninsula, a region of strategic importance.
Providing support to Sevastopol and Crimea residents is our top priority. This attention to the region by the Federation also requires efficient, high quality work by all agencies, regional and municipal authorities.
I want to emphasise that we have been doing and will do everything we can to ensure the stability and security of Crimea, as well as the comprehensive development of transport, energy and all other infrastructure. We will support industrial and agrarian enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, tourism, and create conditions for new investments.
Based on all this, the quality of life of our citizens should improve at an advanced rate, so that they have every opportunity to receive a good and relevant education, contemporary and high-tech medical assistance, which we have already spoken about today, as well as decently paid jobs, so they can plan their future for years ahead, build families and bring up children.
From the beginning, we understood that due to the problems accumulated over decades, it was impossible to do everything at once. This required systematic and painstaking work. And in fact, this is how we proceed, we move towards the set goals gradually, step by step.
In the first stage, we began with the implementation of large, let us put it another way, support projects with high social and economic significance without which it was difficult to imagine a normal life.
These included the expansive and unique Crimean Bridge with its motorway and rail sections, the Tavrida Motorway, and the newest Simferopol air terminal. This list will definitely be updated.
We managed to remove the threat of energy shortages due to the expedited launch of generating capacity, the construction of an energy bridge and modernisation of the local grid equipment. We broke through the energy and transport blockade. I am confident we will resolve the other problems, including water. At this point, this is the most acute, priority issue for all Crimea and Sevastopol residents.
As you know, I instructed the Government to develop and begin implementing a Comprehensive Plan to ensure reliable water supply to the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. This is estimated to run until 2024. And given that the problem is urgent, we agreed to act as quickly as possible and in several areas at once. This includes the development of underground water reserves, the construction of various hydraulic units and treatment systems, as well as the elimination of losses in water supply networks and the desalination of sea water.
Today I would like you to report on how this comprehensive project is progressing, what has already been done for the summer peak season, how Crimea and Sevastopol residents and tourists will be provided with water. Also, our colleagues at the water supply facility in Sevastopol will contact us via videoconference. And we will listen to a report on the progress of the construction of the facility in the Republic of Crimea.
Colleagues,
As I have already said, the successful completion of major basic projects creates favourable conditions for the launch of the next, second, stage of restoring and developing the economy of the Crimean Peninsula.
In effect, this stage implies that the infrastructure, created by the state, should provide opportunities for implementing many more investment projects in all sectors, from industry to the service sector. Above all, we are talking about business initiatives.
Consequently, one of the issues on our current agenda concerns private investment incentives, measures to improve the business climate and to make financial services more affordable.
All of us know the causes of the difficulties and the largely artificial barriers. I would like to note that it will be possible to speak of the success of our actions only if we manage to ensure a substantial and drastic increase in private investment. Their volume in Crimea and Sevastopol should exceed one trillion rubles in the next four years, that is, in 2022–2025.
This is certainly an ambitious task. I repeat, it will require concerted action on the part of federal, regional and municipal authorities, and it is necessary to conduct work while maintaining dialogue and close contact with the business community. It is necessary to study all the proposals from entrepreneurs in the most attentive manner and to ensure they are promptly assessed.
Of course, issues of Crimea’s long-term development are also linked with the prospects of the tourist industry. In 2020, despite all pandemic-related difficulties, 6.9 million people vacationed in Crimea. Of course, this figure is less impressive than in 2019 when eight million people visited the region, but it is still quite impressive.
We should start receiving ten million tourists annually by 2025. At the same time, every person and every guest arriving in Crimea and Sevastopol has a right to expect decent service standards, not inferior to foreign alternatives, as well as a wide range of affordable and high-quality services as regards living conditions, public catering, guided tours, cultural programmes, clean and well-equipped beaches, and public spaces.
Our tourism industry in Crimea with its unique natural, cultural and health-improvement potential simply has to meet top global standards.
Let us start discussing all the issues on the agenda.

Vladimir Putin: Our development programme for Crimea and Sevastopol has been extended until 2025, as it has already been mentioned here. We will continue to improve and build new roads, including the project Mr Khusnullin has mentioned just now: three exits from the Taurida motorway towards the Black Sea coast bypassing Simferopol. We must complete the last section of the motorway with a comfortable entry into Sevastopol. The project is proceeding according to plan.
We will also continue building social facilities – schools, kindergartens, healthcare and cultural establishments.
Of course, attention must also be given, as it has been pointed out today, to water supply, disposal and sewage systems, which are extremely important for resorts and unique places such as Crimea and Sevastopol. Overall, plans provide for building 1,000 facilities, 400 of which have already been completed.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, my friends.
I congratulate you on this holiday – the Day of the reunification of Crimea and Sevastopol with Russia.
This is a holiday for the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol. We understood this and saw it ourselves in the spring of 2014 during preparations for the referendum, and most importantly, following its outcome. As a result of the referendum, the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol returned to their family of origin, the family of the fraternal peoples of the Russian Federation.
But this is also a holiday for our enormous country. I refer to it as enormous since Russia remains the world’s largest territory.
If you look at our map, our big map, Crimea and Sevastopol look like a small dot, but we are talking about the restoration of historical justice. We are talking about the importance of this land for our country and our people. Why? It is very simple.
Our ancestors have been developing this territory since ancient times. In the 10th century a large part of it was simply incorporated into the Ancient Russian State. Prince Vladimir and his warriors were baptized here in Korsun or Chersonesus. This means that this is a sacred place, the centre of the formation of our spiritual unity. Eventually, this place became the foundation of the Russian nation and a united centralised Russian state.
This place is vital to our heart, soul and faith. But there is more to it. Later, in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries these lands fully returned to their lawful owner, the Russian Empire. When foreign hordes invaded our country in 1853–1856, and when it was attacked by Nazi invaders in 1941–1945, every part of this land was soaked in the blood of Russian and Soviet soldiers. Of course, this is a holy land for us, for Russia.
In the 1920s, the Bolsheviks, as they formed the Soviet Union, gave away vast territories, geopolitical spaces, for reasons still hard to understand, to quasi-state entities. Later, as they themselves collapsed, collapsed the party from within and destroyed the Soviet Union, Russia lost great territories and geopolitical spaces.
However, I would like to say that we are ready to live under today’s geopolitical conditions. Moreover, we treat our neighbours not only as geographical neighbours, we treat the peoples of those countries as fraternal peoples; we are ready to lend them our shoulder and give them a hand to ensure progress, to move ahead together by using our competitive advantages, which are many.
But we will never tolerate one thing – someone using Russia’s rich gifts to damage the Russian Federation. I hope this will be heard.
The result of the 2014 referendum is not only a return to historical justice, the restoration of historical justice. We once again distinctly and clearly showed ourselves and the world that our people have the ability to unite around the interests of the Motherland.
And I certainly know the answer to the question I would like to ask today’s audience, yet I cannot resist the temptation to ask, and I cannot deny you the pleasure of giving me a positive answer. Please, take a deep breath and answer this: Do we love Russia?
Response: Yes!
Vladimir Putin: It is this love of our Motherland that runs in our blood, character, and the genes of our people that makes us strong and unites us around common challenges.
We have done a lot, yet there is much to be done in Russia in general and in the development of Crimea and Sevastopol. But we will do it, because we are a single, large, powerful force. Because we are united.
I congratulate you on this day, the Day of Crimea and Sevastopol’s Reunification with Russia. I wish you happiness.
Thank you.
