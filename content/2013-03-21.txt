President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Rogozin,
The Military-Industrial Conference was held yesterday. Could you please tell me about it, its results and the profile boards that were designed to build up cooperation between technology producers and consumers. How do you propose to organise this work?
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin
: The Military-Industrial Conference was held to mark the 60th anniversary of the Military-Industrial Commission. It was attended by about 1,000 delegates, including virtually the entire leadership of Russia’s defence industry and research, as well as the senior Defence Ministry officials.
We discussed all the issues that have accumulated in the first years of the state armament programme implementation. First of all this concerns the issues related to how best to implement the laws signed by you at the end of last year: the new version of the law on the state defence order, the law on the Advanced Research Foundation, and the draft law on the federal contracting system which the State Duma is currently debating.
Therefore, issues of quality, personnel and better work organisation – all of that was considered at the Military-Industrial Conference. We agreed to hold the conference every year to make sure that there is continuous dialogue between industry and state customers.
Naturally, such complex work not only requires the reorganisation of the industry itself, but also the administration system of the military-industrial complex. Therefore, the Military-Industrial Commission decided to establish special profiled boards that will focus on establishing the technological basis for various branches of the Armed Forces.
Last year, you supported our idea to set up a Board for Public-Private Partnership in the Military-Industrial Commission. I want to report to you that this has had good results. Already, private capital is taking part in the implementation of this year’s state defence order; it has taken on and shared the risks with the state. The boards for shipbuilding, aerospace, building control systems, reconnaissance and communications, and space are designed to promote an ongoing constructive dialogue between the state customer represented primarily by the Defence Ministry and producers. I hope that this kind of professional dialogue will help us address all the issues.
I would also like to report that the results of the 2013 state order execution to date are approximately 15% better than last year’s indicators. Therefore, the work continues.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
We talked about aviation issues in Novosibirsk, particularly with regard to the defence sector. And don’t forget that I asked you to prepare a series of meetings on various aspects of the military-industrial complex in relation to the state defence order.
I ask you to prepare proposals jointly with the Executive Office.
Dmitry Rogozin: Mr President, we are planning to dedicate one of the first meetings to the new reconfiguration of the space industry. We are preparing for it now.
Vladimir Putin: Please make sure that it is attended by five to seven people, no more. If the number of participants increases, then you need to break the meeting into several stages, because we will go into details.
Dmitry Rogozin: Good. We will.
