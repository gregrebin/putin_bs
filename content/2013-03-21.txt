President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Rogozin,
The Military-Industrial Conference was held yesterday. Could you please tell me about it, its results and the profile boards that were designed to build up cooperation between technology producers and consumers. How do you propose to organise this work?
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin
: The Military-Industrial Conference was held to mark the 60th anniversary of the Military-Industrial Commission. It was attended by about 1,000 delegates, including virtually the entire leadership of Russia’s defence industry and research, as well as the senior Defence Ministry officials.
We discussed all the issues that have accumulated in the first years of the state armament programme implementation. First of all this concerns the issues related to how best to implement the laws signed by you at the end of last year: the new version of the law on the state defence order, the law on the Advanced Research Foundation, and the draft law on the federal contracting system which the State Duma is currently debating.
Therefore, issues of quality, personnel and better work organisation – all of that was considered at the Military-Industrial Conference. We agreed to hold the conference every year to make sure that there is continuous dialogue between industry and state customers.
Naturally, such complex work not only requires the reorganisation of the industry itself, but also the administration system of the military-industrial complex. Therefore, the Military-Industrial Commission decided to establish special profiled boards that will focus on establishing the technological basis for various branches of the Armed Forces.
Last year, you supported our idea to set up a Board for Public-Private Partnership in the Military-Industrial Commission. I want to report to you that this has had good results. Already, private capital is taking part in the implementation of this year’s state defence order; it has taken on and shared the risks with the state. The boards for shipbuilding, aerospace, building control systems, reconnaissance and communications, and space are designed to promote an ongoing constructive dialogue between the state customer represented primarily by the Defence Ministry and producers. I hope that this kind of professional dialogue will help us address all the issues.
I would also like to report that the results of the 2013 state order execution to date are approximately 15% better than last year’s indicators. Therefore, the work continues.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
We talked about aviation issues in Novosibirsk, particularly with regard to the defence sector. And don’t forget that I asked you to prepare a series of meetings on various aspects of the military-industrial complex in relation to the state defence order.
I ask you to prepare proposals jointly with the Executive Office.
Dmitry Rogozin: Mr President, we are planning to dedicate one of the first meetings to the new reconfiguration of the space industry. We are preparing for it now.
Vladimir Putin: Please make sure that it is attended by five to seven people, no more. If the number of participants increases, then you need to break the meeting into several stages, because we will go into details.
Dmitry Rogozin: Good. We will.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues,
I am very glad to see you. 
I know that a representative delegation of our colleagues from the EU and the European Commission has arrived in Russia to hold our traditional intergovernmental meetings.
I remember our recent meeting in Brussels, which was very informative and useful. I am sure that at meetings with the Russian Government we will be able not only to discuss existing issues and problems, but also to further stimulate our cooperation.
The EU remains our largest trading partner. Last year our trade turnover amounted to more than $410 billion. But Russia is quite an important partner for the European Union too: we stand firmly in third place behind the US and China. The difference in scale is not huge: I think that the US has a trade turnover with EU countries of a little more than $600 billion, while for China it is $545 billion. I think that in the coming years we may well trade about $500 billion.
You know that we are preparing to host the G20 summit. And I very much look forward to working with our European friends in preparing for it. In fact, we are already cooperating in this regard. However, I want to emphasise that we are of course willing to work with all participants in this forum to prepare the agenda and the final documents. I hope that the agreements we reach will be consistent and benefit all international economic actors.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso
: Thank you very much, Mr President,
Dear friends, it is a pleasure to be here. And in fact my participation in the meeting tomorrow between the European Commission and the Russian Government follows on from your visit at that time, when you were leading the Russian delegation two years ago. Back then I also remember that we had a very fruitful meeting.
In fact I come with what I think is the largest delegation ever of Commission members in terms of executive-to-executive meetings. And tomorrow we will have a chance to review the progress made in implementation of our commitments. And where we find that progress has been too slow I think it’s a good opportunity to give it another push together, many pushes.
Why we do that is self-evident, we are not only neighbours but partners; it’s in our interests. We are big partners in trade and investment. I think that, for instance, our economy in Europe needs energy. I think I can also say that Russian economy needs technology. There are a lot of complementarities where we can have win-win solutions. And apart from that, apart from the economic interests, I think we should align. I’ve done it this morning in a conference in the Russian Council of Foreign Relations together with Prime Minister Medvedev. We have a common civilization and we share so many things in common in terms of our history and culture. When I am here in Moscow I feel like I could be in any other European city. I’m sure that you feel the same when you go to the capitals of the European Union. I think that this common civilization matrix is indeed a very important driver for progressively building a relation that is stronger every day.
And why are these relations so important? I think that we both share the vision of a free space from Lisbon to Vladivostok with free circulation of goods and people. Of course we know that this is a long-term vision, that you cannot do it in one go. But we should, as we have said, build it step by step. We can then transform our partnership, which is a partnership of necessity because we are neighbours, but also a partnership of choice because we really want to be close partners.
