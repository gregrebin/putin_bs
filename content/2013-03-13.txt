Moscow
At the opening of a new multipurpose building at the Sambo-70 centre of sports education.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Young sportspeople, I address these words to you and your parents.
Today is a happy moment for all those who love sports. We are here for the opening of this new sports facility, and I want to express my sincere thanks to the Moscow city authorities and to Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin for his contribution in getting this new building completed.
The Sambo-70 school has become a well-known and respected name in Russia and is an institution with its own traditions that has produced some excellent martial arts masters.
Of course, not everyone will or should become a martial arts champion, but you will all receive a wonderful education here that will help to build your characters and give you excellent conditions for your development and for laying the track to your success in life.
I congratulate you and wish you all the very best.
