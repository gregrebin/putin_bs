Meeting with representatives of Russian and Spanish business circles.
Following the meeting, a number of documents on cooperation in transport, energy and investment were signed. In particular, a contract on design and supply of passenger train components, the Agreement on Development, Production, Operation, Maintenance and Testing of New Generation Railway Rolling Stock and Infrastructure, the Memorandum on Cooperation in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, and the Agreement on State Support of Investment Activity in Leningrad Region were signed.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen.
First of all I would like to say that I am very glad to see you in St Petersburg at our forum. We are very pleased that representatives of Spanish and Russian business circles are here.
We communicate quite regularly, and relatively recently we met in St Petersburg during the opening ceremony of the Year of Russia in Spain and Year of Spain in Russia. We had a good conversation then, and I hope that today we will do so again.
Such meetings are very useful; they allow us to analyse the current state of affairs, the current situation and prospects of our bilateral economic relations. The Prime Minister and I were just discussing this and we decided that on the whole the situation is not bad: last year trade turnover increased by quite a lot to more than $7 billion, that is 40 percent more than 2009. But at the same time, it certainly still has not yet reached pre-crisis levels, so we need to expend efforts to bring it to about $10 billion. I think that we can fill this gap, which was created by the crisis.
Clearly, our mutual investments are also growing but, to speak frankly, Mr Prime Minister and I do not believe that they correspond to neither current needs nor the capacity of our respective economies. We expect that the activities of various entrepreneurs, including those in this hall, will affect the quality and intensity of our bilateral ties, and that the relevant mutually beneficial agreements will be signed here at the St Petersburg Forum. I hope that these too will contribute to the development of investment cooperation.
We know that Spanish business is interested in expanding cooperation in the oil and gas sector, in energy relations, in infrastructure projects in transport, shipbuilding and light industry, and in tourism. And for our part we naturally have a number of new areas to suggest. In any case, we will try and diversify our economic ties, especially in light of the agreements that we have in the context of the Partnership for Modernisation initiative. And in this respect our business communities will play a key role.
It is also very nice that such active exchanges are taking place during the reciprocal national years in Russia and Spain. I believe that business relationships are no less valuable than diverse cultural and educational ties, cultural ties that have existed throughout our countries' relations.
Once again, welcome to all and I will now give the floor to my colleague, Mr Prime Minister.
Prime Minister of Spain Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero (re-translated): Thank you, Mr President, for your remarks.
As you know, 2011 is a special year for Spanish and Russian cultural relations, and this will allow us to give an important stimulus to official, economic and cultural relations. I would like to thank President Medvedev for his interest and for the personal responsibilities he assumed in connection with this celebratory year, one which plays such an important role in relations between our two countries.
Russia is a major, crucial economic player in the international arena. In the decade prior to the crisis, its economy grew at an average of seven percent per year, and this was higher than the international average of four percent. During this time Russia rose twelve places in global rankings and its economy ranked eleventh in the world. This was also the cause of improvements to the well-being of Russian citizens: during this time fifteen million of them rose out of poverty.
In 2010, Russia's economy grew at four percent and thus re-joined normal levels of growth. Also in 2010, Spain began to recover from the crisis. This process is quite slow, and the circumstances and situation are quite complicated. In particular, it is caused by problems related to public debt faced by countries in the euro zone.
Spain has undertaken structural reforms in order to correct macroeconomic imbalances, imbalances that accumulated during the previous growth cycle. In addition, we are now planning fiscal adjustments to reduce the current deficit in the external sector. It is there that we are witnessing our economic recovery: in 2010 Spanish exports grew by 14 percent, close to pre-crisis levels, and now traditional markets are also growing rapidly.
Compared with traditional markets, this sector is growing quite rapidly, just like in Russia. In Russia, this balance has grown by 35 percent. For this reason this market is a priority for us, and we view it as a target market within our integrated development plan. And as part of that plan, we expect to reduce our trade deficit which, mainly due to energy imports, surpassed 4 billion euros.
Our bilateral economic relations grew particularly well in 2005. However, despite this growth, economic relations between Spain and Russia do not correspond to the important role both countries play in the global economy, their economic weight, and their extreme openness to international markets (in both countries imports and exports amount to more than fifty percent of GDP). And because of this, there is a big potential for growth, and we still have a long way to go. Today we will take new steps in this direction in order to further strengthen our economic relations.
I am accompanied by a very dynamic team of Spanish entrepreneurs. I am referring to the representatives of leading global companies. Talking about the sectors represented here, they include key competitive ones such as energy, engineering, construction, environment, transport, infrastructure, heavy industry and car manufacturing.
Many of these firms are already present in the Russian Federation and participate in various projects. And at this meeting we will sign an agreement worth 800 million euros, which will supplement the agreements and investments already being implemented, which total around one billion euros.
I am referring to two agreements in energy and railway transport and an agreement on promoting investments in automotive industry components. We will also sign an agreement on cooperation between our countries' industry ministries, which will allow us to implement more effectively the thirty or so projects in which our companies cooperate.
I would like to introduce you to my team, a team of business people working in five specific industries in which we are both interested, namely energy, services, transport, infrastructure and industry.
Allow me, Mr President, to introduce Antonio Brufau, chairman of Repsol, who is representing the energy sector. This is a strategically important sector, one which is especially important for us since your country is the main energy supplier to the European Union.
By combining Russia's potential and Spain's skills not only in conventional energy but also in renewables, where we hold leading positions, particularly in solar and wind, we will create vast potential for cooperation between our businesses.

Closing session of St Petersburg International Economic Forum
The work of the International Economic Forum in St Petersburg came to an end. Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister of Spain Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, President of Finland Tarja Halonen and President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev attended its closing session.

Excerpts from transcript of closing meeting of St Petersburg International Economic Forum
Editor-In-Chief of Dow Jones and Managing Editor of Wall Street Journal Robert Thomson (re-translated): Russia’s growth rate is high in comparison with Western Europe and the United States, but if we compare it to China and India, it is much more modest, to put it mildly. Therefore, President Medvedev, what does the existing growth rate in Russia mean, and will the current economic crisis in Europe affect the situation in Russia?
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Let's start with Europe, the EU and the euro. We wish our European partners to quickly overcome this difficult period and our reasons for that are very simple: the Russian Federation is a major partner of the EU and the EU is our largest trading partner, we have $300 billion a year in trade, which is a huge amount. Plus nearly half of our foreign currency reserves are in euros. Therefore, a great deal in our country depends on the situation in the European Union.
The euro problem, if we don’t dig too deep – and as far as I know nobody has analysed in it in depth so far, the problem is right on the surface: never in the history of mankind has there been a situation when a single strong currency was used by a number of different countries. Some of these countries have strong economies while others, unfortunately have weaker ones, and this contradiction will always cause problems. However, I believe these problems can be resolved, especially since the trend is that the world is moving towards a global currency, which President Nazarbayev has just talked about in his captivating speech.
We want to overcome these problems as quickly as possible. You talked about responsible and voluntary decisions. It will be good if it happens. For some reason this brings to mind the voluntary surrender of animals to collective farms, which took place in our country in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It was not very successful. I hope that all these voluntary decisions to be taken in Greece will meet with greater success and the EU will contribute to it.
Now for the growth rate. You asked why it is different from the growth rates in China and some other countries. The answer is also fairly simple: because Russia is not China, and that is obvious. China has been developing along certain lines for the past 25 to 30 years, and we are just starting out on that course. This is the first point.
Second, there are some purely Chinese factors and purely Russian factors. I will not analyse the factors unique to the China in the absence of President Hu Jintao, who visited our forum yesterday, as that would not be polite.
But there are some purely Russian factors, which I spoke about quite openly yesterday from this podium, perhaps too openly for such a forum because the standard practice at forums is to talk about how well the economy is doing and why we are inviting investors. However, I believe that the purpose of such discussions is not to describe only positive developments, which we certainly have as well, but also to talk about some of our problems. If we tackle these challenges successfully, then perhaps the Russian economy’s growth rate will be comparable to the growth in China or Brazil, or other countries with rapidly evolving markets.
We have our own problems and we must address them. That is what we are trying to do, in any case. I think 4 or 4.5% growth we anticipate this year is not a bad result. But there is still a lot of work to do and we are determined to solve these problems. 
* * *
Robert Thomson: President Medvedev, before your closing address, I would like to ask you one more question. This is St Petersburg, a beautiful city, and we are a small group of friends gathered in this hall…
Are you going to stand for president next year? I think this is an excellent moment to share your thoughts on the matter.
Dmitry Medvedev: I can’t say your question has impressed me with its originality.
You know, I had this feeling for the past 15 minutes that this is not just a group of friends who came to talk about economic development, but also a geography lesson at a school for children with behaviour problems, judging from our latest discussion and the comparisons made by some of my colleagues just now.
I have stated my position on this subject more than once. When I believe the moment is right to say directly whether I will or will not run, I will do so. But this forum is not the best venue for that, and neither is a news conference, although when I spoke about it at the recent new conference journalists were disappointed, they demanded, it seemed, that I do it straight away because it would have been a very dramatic and striking gesture. However, decisions of this kind, and I have spoken about this as well, are usually thought out and made in a very special format. I will certainly let you know my decision. You can rest assured that I will not be able to escape this happy fate and I will not be able to avoid announcing my decision to the Russian people and to all the interested people present here.
You will not have long to wait but every story should have an element of suspense, otherwise life would be boring, so let’s enjoy the suspense a little longer.

Dmitry Medvedev: Friends, President of Kazakhstan, President of Finland, Prime Minister of Spain,
I am very pleased that we have gathered here to discuss economic development, our nations’ lives, our recent achievements and our plans for the future. Yesterday, I talked for half an hour or so about steps that I believe should be taken in this country. I hope those of you who heard my address found it interesting because I think forums such as this are an excellent opportunity to discuss the most pressing and acute problems of our countries’ development.
I have just heard with great interest the speeches of some of my colleagues and I want to say that they were all fascinating and evoked certain emotions that I would like to share with you.
Prime Minister of Spain, Mr Zapatero, talked about the onset of the economic crisis, the events that led up to it and the role that emerging economies played at the time, which is absolutely fair, as well as the lessons of the crisis. Every crisis has its own lessons to teach us. Yesterday evening, when we were discussing the state of our economies and the EU economy, I told the Prime Minister [of Spain], that when we met in late 2008 in the United States, when the previous administration was in office, I had a feeling that we cannot agree on anything. My feeling was that for whatever reasons, possibly because of the attitude of some of my colleagues who had gathered at the time, we would get together, sit around a big table and go our own way, and as a result the crisis would last a very long time if not forever, and the rules regulating international financial relations would not change at all.
Today I am pleased to say that I had been mistaken. Whatever one might think about the G20 and its efforts, I would say that in the end we managed to agree on a large number of vital issues. But this does not mean that we have finished the job. Of course, we must continue our efforts. President of Finland Tarja Halonen said that it would be wise to include such issues on the agenda of the United Nations, and not limit their discussion to G20 and G8 summits. I absolutely agree with that because even the G20 states, which together constitute 85% of the world’s GDP, cannot claim exclusivity. They should consider the opinions of all nations, make general recommendations and subsequently submit them to the United Nations for discussion.
We must continue our efforts. There are still many unresolved problems. What are they? We all know that we were able to reallocate some of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank quotas toward the rapidly growing economies, but the process has not been completed and we must take it to its conclusion.
The financial regulation rules still remain very archaic, as President Nazarbayev explained very clearly.
Auditing and financial reporting remain a clean slate, and little has been done so far. This means that these problems can arise again, given the procyclical nature of crises, no matter what we think about the theory of cycles and other economic theories – Prime Minister Zapatero and I talked about this yesterday and he believes that political efforts must always come first and his position is very firm on this point. Hence, we must work hard at all venues, the G20 and other international forums, of which there are many, including the SCO and BRICS, and the European Union, naturally; we must meet and work at such forums.
President Halonen spoke about a very acute problem that has great importance for all of us: unemployment. At one point the crisis engendered such a hike in unemployment that, frankly, everyone felt very scared. I remember the atmosphere at the G20 summit at that time. Nevertheless, the countries that made efforts to address this issue had some success. I am confident that the countries where this problem persists, including Spain, where the situation is very acute, will nevertheless achieve their goals because what could be more important for a state than to create new jobs? This is an area in which we must join efforts, concentrate our financial resources and work to resolve this problem for millions of people not only in our own countries, but also in countries that are organically linked with us through a huge number of economic ties.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev said that we are patching up the cracks of the crisis, flooding liquidity back. That is absolutely true, and there are both certain advantages and dangers in that. In some ways we have glued our economies back together but will the joints hold up? That is the question. And clearly economic growth cannot be achieved through financial injections alone.
Recovery growth has started in the global economy as a whole. We can see it in all our countries but it is still very timid. I recall our heated debate in this hall two years ago about what this recovery be like and which letter of the alphabet it will look like. Remember? Will it be a V-shaped kind of recovery or an L-shaped one? Most pessimists insisted it will eventually turn into a W, and so we should anticipate another round of the crisis.
Today, we understand the way it works. Perhaps the situation is slightly more optimistic than we had thought but there are new threats, which our colleagues discussed for a long time. I mean threats to southern Europe, or to certain countries, to be precise. I am confident that we will cope with that because there are integration mechanisms and interdependence of the economies.
Yesterday Prime Minister Zapatero and I discussed what would have been the fate of the global economy if a crisis like the crisis of 2008 had happened 50 or 100 years ago. It's terrifying to even imagine that, because the global economy had never experienced such a crisis. Preconditions for it did not exist, that much is true, but at the same time our European colleagues have already achieved success because we have always been striving for integration, given that the economy is global and globalism has certain advantage as well as dangers. Kazakhstan, Belarus and Russia have been trying to tackle our challenges and create our own integration association, and I am sure that we too will achieve success and create a common economic space. Therefore, we achieve relatively quick results due to integration, and that helps us to overcome the crisis. That did not happen 50 or 100 years ago, and this is an advantage of our modern life, however much we criticise it.
Colleagues, I would like to thank all of you for coming to St Petersburg, including the business leaders who have come to love St Petersburg, who come here regularly, sign agreements on the forum’s sidelines, just talk and listen to global leaders. That is very important because if there is no communication between business leaders it means that we have failed in a big way and have huge problems. It is very gratifying that even in 2009, when everyone’s spirits were pretty low, a large number of CEOs of the biggest companies in the world gathered here despite everything.
I would like to sincerely thank my colleagues, heads of state and government, for their effective and active participation. Yesterday, President of China Hu Jintao told us some fascinating facts about Chinese economy’s development. I met with the President of Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister of Belgium. Today, my colleagues from Finland, Spain and Kazakhstan are here. This means, first, that we want to talk with each other, we want to debate various issues. Second, we are aware of our interdependency and this is probably the most important thing. We are not closed; on the contrary, we talk about our problems openly. That is why I am confident that we will succeed. Many thanks again for attending the forum.
One last remark. Yesterday, when I arrived here, I was pleasantly surprised by the weather in St Petersburg. Our weather is not always the best but it was sunny and warm. So last night we remarked how good the weather was, and my friend, the Prime Minister of Spain, said: ”I am going for a run tomorrow morning.“ When we met in the morning, I asked, ”Did you have your run?“ He said, ”No, it started to rain and I don’t run in weather like this.“ Why am I telling you about this? Our economy is as changeable as the weather in St Petersburg: sometimes it’s sunny, and sometimes it rains. But whatever the weather we must work, and as we get to work we know that the sun will come out sooner or later and our countries will experience steady growth and progress, and that is what we work for.
Thank you for your attention.

Dmitry Medvedev met with members of Advisory Board on creation and development of International Financial Centre in Russia
The board’s current activities and plans for the coming year were discussed at the meeting, which was held on the sidelines of St Petersburg International Economic Forum.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today, we have the typical St Petersburg weather, the kind of weather that is absolutely normal for our city. So I hope no one is disappointed. I would like to thank you all agreeing to participate in the work of the International Advisory Board on the creation and development of the International Financial Centre in Russia.
I propose that we briefly discuss plans for this year. The board has already determined the strategic lines of IFC’s development. We agree that the centre should not become some isolated entity in our country or a separate part of the economy, but an integral part of the economic mechanism. This certainly increases the level of complexity of the tasks that lie ahead. In order for them to be a success, it is essential to introduce changes not only in the financial sector, but also in related sectors of the economy, and we all realise that.
Many long-standing issues began to be resolved in recent months, on which there was no progress for a long time, and this has happened partly due to the board’s efforts. We agreed to create a central depository system and to improve financial markets regulation. On March 4 I signed an executive order wich gave the Federal Financial Markets Service was given additional powers of supervision in the insurance market, thus createding a new image of a megaregulator for the financial market.
Now Russia is in the process of joining the Memorandum of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, which allows market regulators to share information, including confidential information. In addition, I have decided to transfer Russian issuers to international accounting standards. Relevant instructions have been issued to the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
“The centre should not become some isolated entity in our country or a separate part of the economy, but an integral part of the economic mechanism.”
Future priorities include the recognition of foreign depositories as nominal holders under Russian law and the abolition of restrictions on the placement and circulation of Russian equity securities abroad.
Another important task is to improve the general infrastructure in Moscow as a city where the basic units of the International Financial Centre will be located. Yesterday I put forward the idea that Moscow should receive an impetus to further development. I hope that it will be beneficial not only for Moscow residents, whose living environment is far from perfect, and not only for government agencies, which in my opinion, should have long become more attentive to the city’s needs. One solution would be to move to new locations specially chosen for this purpose. This will also be important in selecting the site for the IFC as well. In this regard, I believe that the centre of the city, partially vacated by state agencies, could be used to accommodate the IFC offices, though that is not the only option. We should discuss this further and perhaps find another solution. 
 I am convinced that the establishment of the centre will not benefit Russia alone. It will be a major contribution to the development of the financial sector as a whole and to global economic development. We very much hope that your experience and your advice, your support of this project will have a highly beneficial impact on its implementation. I would like to add that in October, we will hold a working meeting of the International Advisory Board, where expert reports will be presented, containing specific ideas and proposals regarding the IFC’s development.

This is a very ambitious project [expanding Moscow’s boundaries], along with the task of creating an IFC. This is also a great challenge for us but, in all probability, it is a very promising initiative. That is why I set out this proposal yesterday. I see it is being actively debated, perhaps more than other proposals, apart form some ideological statements I made yesterday.
Dear friends, I do not want to take too much of your time because all of us still have meetings, sessions and conversations scheduled for today. I will still have meetings with my colleagues. The forum has become extremely popular, and in addition to your involvement, for which I am very grateful to you all and once again would like to thank you for it, the forum is attended by leaders of other countries and I still have several such meetings planned.
* * *
Just one more remark: I would like to thank everyone for their help, which in fact extends beyond the International Financial Centre. I have used some of your materials when preparing for such well-known events as G8 and G20 summits. As you know, during the economic crisis Russia never said that it was the banks’ fault. Our position was quite different: we did not place the blame entirely on financial institutions. I believe our task now is to promote positive change in international financial regulation, especially as the G20 has not yet come to agreement regarding international financial reporting or audit, or on many other issues that are relevant not only to Russia's financial centre but also to global finance.
Thank you very much. I hope to see you soon. We count on your help.

With Prime Minister of Spain Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Prime Minister, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you here in St Petersburg and at the forum. I would like to thank you for your decision to take part in it; we highly value it. This is very important for the development of full-scale intensive Russian-Spanish relations and for the forum, which has been held here for a number of years, to gain momentum.
The two of us started discussing the agenda yesterday. During our meeting in the evening we talked about the situation in the global economy and in the European economy. It was an interesting conversation because for us it is crucial to understand what is happening in Europe, in its separate economies, and what is happening with our closest partners. The EU is Russia’s biggest trading partner: our trade volume is over $300 billion. Spain plays a major role in this relationship. So, it was a compelling discussion and I thank you for it.
I hope you enjoyed St Petersburg yesterday, without rain. The weather is a bit worse today but I think it’s just right for us to get down to work. Once again, welcome and I wish you an excellent stay in St Petersburg.
Prime Minister of Spain Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero (re-translated): Mr President, thank you for your warm welcome and for your invitation to participate in St Petersburg Economic Forum, which is gaining importance every year.
Spain's participation in this forum allows us to deepen and strengthen political relations between Spain and Russia, especially economic relations, which are of particular significance for Spain and for the entire European Union. There is an increasing number of Spanish companies in Russia, and a growing volume of contracts between Russian and Spanish companies.
“The EU is Russia’s biggest trading partner: our trade volume is over $300 billion. Spain plays a major role in this relationship.”
Russia is a big country and a big market that has significant energy potential and resources. Today we will sign a number of important business agreements. In addition, this forum is an opportunity for us to analyse the international financial crisis, to think about what is happening in the eurozone and make some conclusions.
There are three conclusions we can draw already. First, it is essential to consolidate transparency and openness, to strengthen regulation and adopt new requirements for financial markets.
Second, it is vital to expand cooperation, strengthen the alliance between various countries at the level of regional organisations (this may be the European Union and great powers like Russia), and at the level of international organisations, such as the IMF. Cooperation is the answer to economic challenges that we face today and will face tomorrow.
Third, we must focus on education and innovation, and we must do so with great determination. Let’s concentrate on technology, on a more efficient economy and industry, and make sure that finance does not dominate over the real economy. We must imbue it with a new meaning to ensure that the real economy dominates over finance.
Russia is our political ally and our trade ally, vital for EU’s energy security and security in general. Those are the reasons why the Spanish government is committed to actively developing political relations with Russia.
2011 is the Year of Spain in Russia and the Year of Russia in Spain. We can already see its first achievements: progress made in the cultural relations, in the economic relations, and this success is largely due to the active stand of President Medvedev, who has always felt a closeness to our country and promoted special economic relations with us. So I would like to take this opportunity to reassure President Medvedev about the quality and safety of our agricultural produce, especially vegetables.

Meeting with President of Finland Tarja Halonen
Dmitry Medvedev and Tarja Halonen discussed topical issues of Russian-Finnish cooperation.
June 18, 2011

St Petersburg
With Finnish President Tarja Halonen.
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.
* * *
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Madam President, dear Tarja,
I am very happy to meet again at our forum in St Petersburg. We just had a discussion, in my opinion a very interesting one, about the economic situation in the EU, in individual countries. In any case, I think we are of the same opinion that in order to achieve good results we must cooperate with and help each other.
Russian-Finnish relations are currently very good and we would like them to remain so in the future. We would like them to develop so that they are replete with new contracts, agreements, cooperation in the cultural and educational spheres, and in general for them to be full-fledged, as relations between neighbours should be.
We plan to work in this vein. I would like to say a special thanks once again for coming to St Petersburg to our forum.
(In Finnish.) Thank you.
President of Finland Tarja Halonen
(in Russian): Thank you.
(re-translated.) Regarding Russian-Finnish relations we really can say: ”They are all right.“ But at the same time we must remember that even a good relationship will not last long if we do not cultivate it.
And no matter how good the current presidents are, it is very important to make sure that the next generation of leaders, those who come after us, also find many propitious areas for cooperation. The Economic Forum in St Petersburg represents a great opportunity for networking. I hope that in the future we will create other such forums, other settings for enhanced cooperation.
Official meetings between the European Union and Russia, between Finland and Russia are very important events. But no less important are those such as, for example, the Baltic Sea [Action] Summit, and in general our cooperation in the Baltic Sea.
Cooperation between our countries' border regions is extremely important. And with a view to expanding this cooperation, I can assure you that we are working not only with you, dear Dmitry: last year, Finland issued 960,000 visas to Russian citizens, of which eighty percent were multiple entry visas. This year the number of visas granted by Finland increased by 30 percent compared with the similar period last year: the Finns and Russians are visiting each other very assiduously.
I hope that the promising ideas that were put forward during this Forum will be developed and further worked out.
