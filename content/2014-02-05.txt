President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
Only one-and-a-half days remain now until the opening of this year’s biggest sporting event – the XXII Sochi Winter Olympics
. Russia has spent 7 years preparing for this moment. These Games became a huge project for the entire country.
It makes me especially happy to see that there was complete consensus, as they say in such cases, on the idea of holding these Games and hosting this event. This became a major industrial and construction project, the biggest construction site in the world. We had to build everything practically from scratch. Building in an open field is not so hard, but building the mountain cluster was a very difficult task.
New high-tech sports facilities were built from scratch, as were two clusters to house the athletes, one here in the Imeretin Valley beside the sea, and the other in the mountains. This work is all complete now and Russia is ready to host the Games.
I want now to address these words to you, the sportspeople, the members of our national team. Today, we are raising the Russian flag. As you know, the flag is always raised when the country’s national team arrives at the Games. Our hundreds, thousands and millions of fans will all be watching you and following closely your every performance. We count on you and place our hopes in you. We have a young and very promising team and I am confident that you will do everything you can to win.
Of course the main thing is an open, honest and courageous fight, and I know that you have what it takes here. You will achieve the best results of your sporting careers, and I hope very much that this difficult and responsible work will bring you pleasure too and that you will be happy with the results of your efforts. 
Today, we are seeing top-level sport before our very eyes, but what you do never ceases to amaze us. What you do pushes human ability to its limits and is on a par with the skill and arts of the circus at the minimum. This is a great delight for all sports fans.
I wish you good luck, because apart from courage and determination, luck is important too in sport, and so I hope that luck will always be on your side.
I wish you success and all the very best!

Answers to journalists’ questions during a visit to the Coastal Olympic Village
Question: Mr President, you have meetings scheduled here with heads of state and government. There is a tradition to use the pause offered by the Olympic Games to work on solving the global problems. What kind of advice would you give them during this Olympic pause?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: They do not need my advice. They are their countries’ leaders and very experienced people. Since we will be meeting with each other, we will discuss various issues anyway, one way or another. I am sure that we should make maximum use of this pretext and opportunity to meet and discuss things in a calm, neutral and very friendly atmosphere in order to look for common ground if we have differences on this or that matter, so as to make progress in resolving any of the problems before us, and there is no shortage of problems in the world. I hope that this friendly setting will help us to resolve these problems.
Question: Which issues would you focus on in these discussions?
Vladimir Putin: There are many problems. You know them too and so there is no need to list them. But each country has its own priorities. Our colleagues from Asia will be coming, and they are worried of course about what will happen in Afghanistan after the forces there withdraw. This is an issue of concern to us too because these are Russia’s southern neighbours. We know what the situation is like there as far as the borders are concerned, and we know that there are still problems with border security. There are many problems, many economic problems too. I think that one way or another we will discuss all of these issues in priority during these meetings, security, the economy, the Middle East, Afghanistan and other matters.
Question: Mr President, everyone’s greatest concern is security at the Games. How guaranteed is security?
Vladimir Putin: This is always everyone’s biggest worry, not just at big international events, but at big political events too. We all remember the tragic moments at past international competitions, in the United States for example, when people were killed at the marathon, and this was all not so long ago. And the Olympics have had their share of tragedies too, sadly, as have events such as the G8, when terrorist attacks took place in the London underground.
But I want to thank our colleagues from practically all of the countries involved in one way or another with organising these Games, because they are working together very actively with their Russian partners. You know that we have set up an operations headquarters here, where our colleagues are present the whole time too, working round the clock: intelligence services representatives and law enforcement officers from many different countries.
