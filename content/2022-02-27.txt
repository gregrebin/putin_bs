President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,
You see that Western countries are not only taking unfriendly economic actions against our country, I mean the illegitimate sanctions of which everyone is well aware, but top officials of the leading NATO countries are indulging in aggressive statements directed at our country.
Therefore, I order the Defence Minister and Chief of the General Staff to put Russian Army’s deterrence forces on high combat alert.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu
: Yes, sir.
Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov
: Yes, sir.
