Busan
President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Allow me to offer my warmest greetings to you and your colleagues.
I have the impression of not even having parted from some of your colleagues and it is very pleasing that we have this kind of ongoing contact in practically all areas of our bilateral relations and in international issues.
I am especially pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you at the start of our work here, in Korea, because you have already been in the region a while and will be able to update me on what is happening here.
Thank you.
U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W.BUSH: Thank you, Vladimir, for us being able to hold this meeting. I always like to have a good discussion with you. Yes, you are right; we do have very good relations. We value your advice and the sincerity of our relations. Once again, thank you.

Meeting with Prime Minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra
November 18, 2005
20:56
Busan, South Korea
President Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to continue the dialogue that we began not long ago in Moscow. I have just refreshed my memory on some of the figures concerning our cooperation and was interested to see that trade between our two countries increased by 92 percent over the last seven months. Although it is not such a huge figure, our bilateral trade looks nonetheless like reaching a total of approximately $2 billion this year. We are working on a number of proposals by our experts and are also working on your proposals, Mr Prime Minister, including on the agreement to abolish visas for Russians travelling to Thailand and for Thai citizens travelling to Russia. We are also working on the cooperation programme for our countries over the upcoming period. I am very happy to have the chance to discuss with you today these and other areas of our joint work.
Prime Minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawat: Thank you, Mr President. I have warm memories of the hospitality with which you received me during my brief visit to Russia. Every occasion that I have come to Russia and have had the chance of meeting with you, Mr President, has always given me great happiness and let me see how fast Russia is developing under your leadership.
I am pleased to note, as you rightly pointed out, that our bilateral trade has reached the normal level that we had previously before the economic crisis and also during the Soviet period. I am sure that our cooperation is only set to expand over the coming 2–3 years, especially given the projects in various areas that you and I discussed, including in transport and in modernising Thailand’s armed forces. There are also the projects we have for cooperation in the oil sector and in various scientific areas. I hope that next year, when the APEC summit takes place in Vietnam, you will find the time either on your way to or on your way home from Vietnam, to make a visit to Thailand. I hope that you will then have the opportunity to see the fruit of our cooperation and the results of the investment being made in Thailand.

Dear friends!
I am happy to once again have the opportunity of visiting your wonderful country, a country that is following the road of progress and creation with confident strides and has achieved truly impressive results. I know very well that these achievements are the result above all of the initiative, hard work and perseverance of the people of the Republic of Korea.
It is symbolic that this visit is taking place 15 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. Over this short time we have successfully established a constructive dialogue, expanded our political, trade, economic and cultural ties, and enriched the direct contacts between our countries’ business, scientific and cultural communities. I particularly want to note our fruitful cooperation in strengthening peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and developing multilateral cooperation in Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region in general.
We value greatly the level of bilateral partnership we have reached and we are committed to continued active work together. I hope that my visit will serve the noble cause of strengthening the friendship, trust and mutual understanding between our peoples.
I sincerely wish all the citizens of South Korea continued success, prosperity and peace.

Beginning of Meeting with President of the People’s Republic of China Hu Jintao
November 18, 2005
20:35
Busan
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr President, allow me to offer you my greetings. I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with you and with our Chinese friends and colleagues. The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation was in China just recently and held very intensive talks with our Chinese colleagues. Intensive development is continuing in all the different areas of our joint work and we sense that our Chinese colleagues are set on pursuing precisely this policy of cooperation with the Russian Federation. I can assure you that there is no doubt in Russia that developing relations between our country and the People’s Republic of China is completely in keeping with our national interests.
President of China Hu Jintao: I am pleased to be meeting with you again two months after our last meeting. As you noted, this year has been marked by successful and intensive development of Chinese-Russian relations. I visited Russia twice this year and this meeting is our fourth so far this year. Together we issued the Joint Declaration on the International Order in the Twenty-First Century, which sets out our common positions on topical international issues. We have held our first joint military exercises, launched a mechanism for consultations on strategic security issues and established an institution for inter-parliamentary cooperation. The recent meeting between our two heads of government resulted in progress being made. All of these steps increase the trust between us and make it possible for us to raise the level of our strategic partnership. China places great importance on developing relations with Russia. We see relations with Russia as one of the most important elements of our foreign policy and we are ready to work together with your country to take our strategic partnership to a new level.
Vladimir Putin: The schedule for next year is such that a large number of Russian-Chinese bilateral events will be taking place in China. I would also like to note another area of our cooperation – cultural cooperation. In 2006 and 2007 we are preparing to organise respectively the Year of Russia in China and the Year of China in Russia.
I am sure that these events will create a favourable climate for developing business cooperation. I know that you, Mr President, support the idea of holding the Year of China in Russia and the Year of Russia in China.
Hu Jintao: Yes, we do indeed place immense importance on holding the Year of Russia in China and the Year of China in Russia. We have already established an organising committee headed by Vice Premier Wu Yi, with State Council members Tang Jiaxuan and Chen Zhili as her deputies. The organising committee also includes the representatives of legislative bodies, major enterprises, cultural circles and the armed forces.
Preparatory work has already begun. First, our idea is that we could organise several major, significant events in combination with our mutual visits in order to involve our peoples in actively participating and making a contribution towards developing the friendship between China and Russia. Second, we also need to examine fully the way existing cooperation mechanisms between our countries work in order to go even further in strengthening our business cooperation in the most diverse range of sectors. Third, it is important to activate cultural and personal exchanges so as to build greater mutual understanding between our peoples and in this way strengthen the friendship between us.
Improving the mutual understanding between our youth is particularly important. We have already outlined some of our ideas for organising events in this area to the Russian side. I hope that the two sides will be able to hold consultations rapidly in order to come to decisions on these events so that we can begin work on implementing our ideas as soon as possible. Comrade Wu Yi has already sent an invitation to Mr Medvedev so that he can visit our country in the nearest future.
Vladimir Putin: This is a very good choice on your part.
