President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President.
Allow me to offer my warmest greetings to you and your colleagues.
I have the impression of not even having parted from some of your colleagues and it is very pleasing that we have this kind of ongoing contact in practically all areas of our bilateral relations and in international issues.
I am especially pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you at the start of our work here, in Korea, because you have already been in the region a while and will be able to update me on what is happening here.
Thank you.
U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W.BUSH: Thank you, Vladimir, for us being able to hold this meeting. I always like to have a good discussion with you. Yes, you are right; we do have very good relations. We value your advice and the sincerity of our relations. Once again, thank you.
