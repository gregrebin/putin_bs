President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
Today, we will review efforts to promote our relations with our closest neighbours and partners. We have a lot of work ahead of us considering the multiple elements that have to be taken into consideration, including economic matters, humanitarian cooperation, and regional security.
We have several rapporteurs. I suggest we begin with security matters. Mr Bortnikov, you have the floor.
