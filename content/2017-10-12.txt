Beginning of meeting with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev, thank you for your decision to stay for one more day after the CIS and EAEU summit meetings.
There are several bilateral issues we need to discuss, including our broad cooperation in politics, security and, of course, the economy. I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss all these issues with you.
We meet regularly and very frequently, simply because we need to do so in the current situation and also considering our joint work. Our meetings are a major factor of developing interstate relations. I am glad to have this opportunity, and I am confident that this will benefit both sides.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev: Mr Putin, thank you very much. I am glad to have stayed in Sochi in this wonderful weather.
Yesterday we held a very important event that concerned the CIS and the EAEU. Today we meet to discuss bilateral issues.
This year we will mark 25 years of our diplomatic relations, which have been reinforced with the treaty of friendship and mutual assistance, which looks into the 21st century and which will be reinforced with other elements yet.
Russia is an important, or more precisely, the most important and reliable partner and ally for Kazakhstan. This tells it all. Russia holds a major place in our trade, and our relations have grown stronger in the past few years of cooperation within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union
. In the first nine months of this year, our trade increased by 33 percent, that is, by one third.
We create new joint ventures and launch joint investment projects in all spheres of the economy. Those who criticised the Eurasian Union and predicted its downfall because of the market situation have seen that open borders, open relations between people and open movement of capital and investments have led to positive results in our two countries.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
Despite certain problems in the Russian economy because of the sanctions, we are moving forward and we are resolved to continue with this policy. Kazakhstan will always be the most reliable partner for Russia and vice versa. There are many practical issues we need to discuss.
Our cooperation at Baikonur
is developing very well. I have visited it recently, and I will tell you about this trip. We will meet in Chelyabinsk, at the 15th interregional meeting on human resources. We will also meet at the CSTO
summit this year. In other words, we meet and exchange opinions so often that there are no unsettled issues left in our relations.
I have visited all Central Asian states, including Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. You have visited them as well. There are regional and also international political issues we need to discuss, as well as what Kazakhstan can do to help Russia. There are no unsettled issues between our countries, and we continue to strengthen our friendship and cooperation.
Thank you for your attention, for this meeting and for everything we do together.
