President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I would like to congratulate you on a significant date, the 15th anniversary of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring).
At its establishment, the service was set a number of important tasks, namely to combat shadow capital, block the supply channels of terrorist and criminal organisations, enhance the transparency of the national financial system and introduce advanced financial reporting standards in the banking system.
Rosfinmonitoring has become an integral part of the system of national security. Thanks to your contribution, Russia has quickly become a leader of the international money laundering prevention system.
There are persisting threats in this sphere, and therefore your direct obligation is to find new and more effective methods of combating money laundering. I want you to know that active efforts in this area are contributing to the overall struggle against terrorism and organised crime. Moreover, we need more effective methods to maintain the transparency of financial institutions.
Your other priorities include reliable monitoring of the efficient use of state defence procurement funds and budget resources. I expect that you will maintain close and effective cooperation with all other law-enforcement and regulatory agencies, the Bank of Russia and the Accounts Chamber.
In conclusion I would like to express gratitude to the Rosfinmonitoring staff for their competence and commitment.
Once again, congratulations on the serviceâ€™s 15th anniversary. I wish you success in your work, and health and prosperity to you and your families.
