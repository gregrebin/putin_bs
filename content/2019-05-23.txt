President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
In recent times we have established this tradition where I meet with heads of the Russian Federation regions that have completed their work in these positions. Some take new positions while others focus on personal pursuits. However, almost all former regional governors continue using the experience they gained in their respective regions and their life experience. They may continue working in a new capacity, at a different level and maybe in different regions or in Moscow.
I would like to talk with you about this part, this component. And, of course, I would like to thank you for the work you have done in the regions where you were in office for many years. I would like to hope that you will provide the necessary support to your successors to enable them to smoothly and naturally start working and win the trust of the people who live in the regions that you headed. The main point is to help them use what you, among others, accomplished in the past few years and go further in the interests of people living on these territories, in these regions of the Russian Federation, that is, to achieve the goals we are all working for.
This takes care of what I wanted to say for now. Thank you once again for everything you have done.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
First of all, I would like to thank all those who will receive state decorations today for their work and impressive achievements, loyalty to Russia and dedicated, creative and compassionate involvement in the country’s life. Your breakthrough ideas and brilliant endeavours make a tremendous contribution to its development and to our common progressive movement forward. Your exemplary lives inspire millions of people to strive for even greater achievements and to work for the benefit of our Fatherland.
The powerful and dynamic personality of Valentina Matviyenko combines wisdom and experience, a systemic perception of state tasks, an ability to ensure their accomplishment and utmost responsibility. She became the first woman to head the Federation Council, and she is doing a lot in this capacity to strengthen Russian parliamentarianism and federalism. Ms Matviyenko has been awarded the Order of St Andrew the Apostle, one of the highest Russian decorations.
Our Fatherland’s best minds have always strived for its brighter future and called for a worthy education for the future generations. Higher education institutions play a tremendous role in this respect.
Decorations are being presented today to rectors of the country’s leading universities – Viktor Sadovnichy, Mukhadin Eskindarov and Viktor Grishin, and to heads of famous art schools and studios – Nikolai Tsiskaridze and Sergei Andriyaka.
Large-scale and noble work is conducted by the National Centre of Child Haematology, Oncology and Immunology. When its head Alexander Rumyantsev says: “No problem,” (and I have heard him say this many times), it means that the Centre will swing into action and get down to business. This striving to achieve success in treating grave child diseases has become a motto for the Centre’s entire team. Mr Rumyantsev is present in this hall today. His colleagues representing various areas of modern medicine are also present here. Friends, the work of each of you deserves the highest praise.
The space industry always leads in discovering advanced innovations in science and technology. It is being promoted by people dedicated to their business. Many of them participate in orbital flights and carry out the most challenging assignments. Space exploration has become an ordinary profession but it still remains, without any doubt, a heroic profession. Present here today are representatives of this courageous group: Fedor Yurchikhin, Andrei Borisenko and Oleg Novitsky.
Motherland has honoured test pilot Vladimir Kutanin with a high decoration. His work is often linked to emergencies. It is these situations that reveal endurance, courage and true mastery.
I am happy to welcome to this ceremony all those who work in industry, ensure the operation of the key enterprises and sectors of the Russian economy and create our country’s national wealth.
National culture is its inalienable part. Vladimir Fedoseyev, a brilliant conductor and head of the Tchaikovsky Grand Symphony Orchestra, has never betrayed his vocation that implies serving the music and its folk traditions.
An entire constellation of favourite actors, musicians and artists are present here as well. You are creating an inimitable, unique image of modern Russia and reflect the extraordinary variety of its talents.
We are a country of amazing opportunities, a country that is generous, hospitable and open to cooperation and dialogue. We cherish friendship and are grateful to all those who support these traditions and promote the ideas of peace and partnership in a wide variety of areas.
Sport is certainly one of these areas. The colourful festivity that the FIFA World Cup bestowed on us will remain in our memory for a long time to come. I am grateful to all those who helped this dream come true – citizens of Russia, our foreign partners, and, of course, FIFA President Gianni Infantino.
Friends, you have reached impressive heights. I wish you new successes, health and wellbeing. I am glad to see all of you.
<…>
Vladimir Putin: Friends,
I see that here, in this hall and among the awardees, of course, and in the hall in general there are representatives of great many different activity areas and professions, such as doctors, teachers, industrial workers, athletes, and representatives of different arts. All of us are one big and invincible team. With the foreign members, who are an ornament to our team, it is becoming as attractive as it looks today.
Thank you very much for your work.

Meeting with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.
Earlier, the President of Russia presented the FIFA President with the Order of Friendship, a Russian state decoration.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
Allow me to welcome you to Russia again and congratulate you on receiving a Russian state decoration.
I would like to thank you for everything you did for the preparation of the FIFA World Cup Russia and the high assessments of our work that you made today.
I know that you also have much work ahead. We are always at your disposal, always ready to be by your side and join the implementation of the plans on developing world football which you described today.
I am sure that with your energy and talent as an organiser you will achieve everything.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino: (In Russian.) Spasibo.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
First of all, thank you again for this wonderful and prestigious award. As I said, I feel an emotion which I cannot express in words. It reminds me, of course, about the years of work towards the World Cup and the World Cup itself. The best World Cup ever. And it is not me saying this; it’s the world saying it. And the fact that this is the Order of Friendship is also very symbolic, because, I said it last year, I repeated it before the World Cup, during the World Cup and after the World Cup: the world has discovered a country of friends in Russia. This sort of friendship will last forever. So the work with the World Cup started some years ago; the World Cup has taken place, but it is just the beginning and not the end of our cooperation. So on behalf of the world of football – and it’s only four or five billion people – (In Russian.) spasibo bolshoye.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

With President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
The prospects for the development of bilateral cooperation and issues on the regional agenda were among the topics discussed.
A package of documents was signed following the talks, including intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and mass communications. The documents also concern the settlement of the Republic of the Congo’s debt to the Russian Federation under previously issued loans, cooperation between the Russian Interior Ministry and the Congolese Ministry of the Interior and Decentralisation, cooperation in agriculture, and sending Russian military experts to the Republic of the Congo. In addition, documents on the relations between LUKOIL and the State Oil Company of the Republic of the Congo as well as between TMK (Pipe Metallurgical Company) and the National Petroleum Company of the Congo were signed.

Beginning of conversation with President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou-Nguesso
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am very glad to see you. It is not your first time in Russia. And it is not the first time we are meeting, so I am very glad to use this opportunity to continue our contacts.
Our countries have always had friendly relations; they have been developing this way for 55 years now. Our trade is growing – by over 60 percent – although, unfortunately, the numbers in absolute terms are still modest. But we have good potential in several industries, such as energy, the processing industry and agriculture. I am sure that we will be able to discuss all these issues during your visit. It will be quite busy; it is a working visit in the fullest sense of the word.
And, of course, we will be happy to see you at the first Russia-Africa summit in Sochi this October.
Welcome, Mr President.
President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou-Nguesso (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President!
I still remember how warmly I was welcomed here in November 2012. Thank you very much for sending me an invitation again. And thanks for the warm welcome I have been enjoying since I arrived. I am confident that our talks will be successful and will allow our relations to reach a new level.
You know that the Congo occupies a strategic position in Central Africa. And now, fortunately, we are seeing full conciliation in the region of Central Africa. At the same time, there are certain alarming signs in our region, in the centre and in the west of the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo], in the north of the CAR [Central African Republic] and Chad. In the west of Cameroon, Boko Haram is rampant. You know the situation in Gabon with Ali Bongo. And we are at the centre of all these events.
We preside over the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region. And we are playing a stabilising role in Africa that can bring peace to this region. We in our country want to stabilise the situation as a whole. And we hope that Russia will act side by side with us to create peace in the African region.
You know that in economic terms there was a certain crisis associated with a decrease in oil prices. This crisis affected us, but we are gradually recovering. Now we are negotiating with the IMF on obtaining loans, we are negotiating with the IMF Executive Board and hope to get support in this matter from our Russian friends.
