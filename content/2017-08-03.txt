Visiting the construction site of the Amur Gas Processing Plant.
The head of state was shown scale models of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline and the Amur Gas Processing Plant. Chairman of Gazprom Management Board, Alexei Miller, told Vladimir Putin about the deadlines and construction stages for the new plant and gas pipeline.
The Amur Gas Processing Plant, now under construction 15 kilometres from the town of Svobodny on the banks of the Zeya River, will be the largest Russian gas refinery and a major facility worldwide. It will play an important part in the technological chain of future natural gas deliveries to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline. The project will promote socioeconomic and industrial development in the Amur and other Far Eastern regions.
Construction has been progressing since October 2015; site preparation is currently being completed, and road, railway and river infrastructure are also being built. In addition, preparations are underway to build a residential area for about 3,000 employees.
While visiting the plant, Vladimir Putin took part in a videoconference and heard reports from Gazprom Dobycha Noyabrsk Director General Igor Krutikov from the Chayandinskoye oil, gas and condensate field in Yakutia that will ship gas to the Amur plant, and by Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk Director General Anatoly Titov, from a section of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.
The preparatory stage of this major effort is over and today we are launching this large project.
In the past 50 years, our country has not seen anything similar. Neither the Soviet Union nor Russia have implemented projects of this scale. The only plant of a comparable size was built during the Soviet times in Orenburg. It had a capacity of 38 billion cubic metres of gas per year. This plant’s capacity will be 42 billion, which is a breakthrough not only for the industry but also in the overall development of the Russian Far East.
During peak periods, the construction will require several thousand people, or almost 25,000 workers, to be more precise. Once the plant is complete, it will employ 2,500 to 3,000 people, which will allow us not only to move forward in gas production but also to create conditions for building another giant plant in the country and one of the largest in the world. It will be a gas chemical plant employing tens of thousands of people during construction and then a large staff to operate the plant.
Thus, we will be equipped to not only perform our export obligations but to expand the gas network in Yakutia and begin supplying gas to Amur Region, where it is almost non-existent.
All this is an ambitious project, of which you are all participants. I want to wish you every success.
Good luck!
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller: Mr President,
The Amur Gas Processing Plant is an important element of the Eastern gas programme. Once opened, it will annually process 42 billion cubic metres of gas and produce 38 billion cubic metres of commercial gas.
This plant will become the largest gas processing facility in Russia and the world’s second largest in terms of gas processing volumes. In terms of helium production, this will become the largest helium production plant in the world, the No. 1 plant. It will also produce 2.5 million tonnes of ethane and 1.7 million tonnes of liquefied hydrocarbon gases.
There are plans to complete the plant stage by stage and to open six production lines, with each line producing seven billion cubic metres of gas. The first stage, or two production lines, will be commissioned in May 2021. The Amur Gas Processing Plant is an integral element of the production chain linking our gas production centres at the Kovyktinskoye deposit in Irkutsk Region and the Chayandinskoye oil, gas and condensate field in Yakutia via the Power of Siberia trunk gas pipeline.
Yakutia’s Chayandinskoye oil, gas and condensate field is on the line.
Gazprom Dobycha Noyabrsk Director General Igor Krutikov: Good afternoon, Mr President and Mr Miller. This is Gazprom Dobycha Noyabrsk Director General Igor Krutikov reporting.
You can see a modern drilling rig behind me. These rigs are currently used to drill gas wells at the Chayandinskoye oil, gas and condensate field. Today, we are exceeding our drilling targets by over 20,000 metres. We have drilled 73 gas and eight oil wells to date. After attaining design capacity, the Chayandinskoye oil, gas and condensate field is to produce up to 25 billion cubic metres of gas and at least 1.5 million tonnes of oil annually.
Currently, vigorous efforts to build production facilities are underway, including oil treatment and comprehensive gas treatment units. Today, the Chayandinskoye oil, gas and condensate field employs 5,000 experts and uses over 1,000 pieces of equipment, operating 24 hours a day.
I would like to assure you that the current pace of work will help to successfully implement the state Eastern gas programme to ensure the timely delivery of products to consumers.
Thank you for your attention.
Alexei Miller: We have a linkup now with a construction section of the Power of Siberia trunk gas pipeline.
General Director of Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk Anatoly Titov: Good afternoon Mr President, Mr Miller. This is General Director of Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk Anatoly Titov reporting.
Our company was appointed customer for this construction, and operator of the Power of Siberia trunk gas pipeline once it comes on line. Today, 1,640 km of pipe have been delivered to the pipeline route. This is 80 percent of the total. All of the pipes are made by Russian companies. We have 8,500 people and around 4,000 pieces of equipment working on the construction. Welding has been completed for 1,150 km today, which is 53 percent of the total length. The welding is done using modern automatic welding equipment. All work meets environmental standards. We are up to the task ahead, to supply gas to the Amur Gas Processing Plant and to China in December 2019.
This concludes my report
Alexei Miller: Mr President,
The Chayandinskoye and Kovytkinskoye fields, the Amur Gas Processing Plant and Power of Siberia are all integral parts of the Eastern Gas Programme, which will create an integrated gas production, transportation, processing and supply system in Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East.
The Power of Siberia trunk gas pipeline, which will be commissioned on December 20, 2019, is the backbone of this system. What is important is that the Amur Gas Processing Plant is playing an important part in developing our international cooperation. Construction subcontractors for the plant include our partners from the People’s Republic of China. The heads of these companies are present at the ceremony today and I would like to welcome them.
The Amur Gas Processing Plant, once it comes on line, will give a powerful boost to socioeconomic development in the Far East and Eastern Siberia and will ensure the implementation of the programme to connect people to the gas network in these regions. I wish all of the construction workers and company staff success with this project.
A large part of the preliminary work for the main facility’s construction has already been completed. Mr President, I would like to ask you to give the signal to start laying cement for the Amur Gas Processing Plant’s first foundation.
Vladimir Putin: Go ahead!
Alexei Miller: The work to lay the Amur Gas Processing Plant’s first foundation has begun.
Vladimir Putin: Congratulations! I wish you success and all the very best.

Working meeting with Amur Region Governor Alexander Kozlov
Mr Kozlov briefed the President on the region’s socioeconomic situation. The discussion also focused on the complaints and requests sent in by local residents to the head of state during the Direct Line.

Amur Region
The Governor said the gross regional product is growing, due in part to the implementation of a number of large-scale projects. Mr Kozlov also spoke about the execution of the Presidential executive orders that directly concern people's lives. He paid particular attention to the issue of relocating people from hazardous housing.

<…>
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: At my meetings with governors, I hand over documents to them (and I consider requests and complaints received during the Direct Line to be documents). I would like to hand over such a folder to you. The complaints there are typical, such as the condition of roads and wage levels, including those in the public sector.
But what drew my attention were the complaints related to healthcare. It is understood that the network of medical institutions has to be optimised. However, shutting down healthcare facilities in small towns and villages and depriving people of any access to medical aid is unjustified. People speak of quite specific issues here. A healthcare facility shuts down, and people have no way of getting to the nearest outpatient clinic or hospital, located 85 or 100 kilometres away, and so forth.
The second issue is paid medical services. It appears that this occurs not only in your region but countrywide. ”We have to make a [free] appointment with a doctor a month in advance, there are no appointment cards, and to have our tests, we have to wait for three months – while if we pay for the services, we can get them any time.“ This is a direct violation of the law. This is a crime, and it has to be monitored. Fine? I would like you to look through this folder and work on it. I want to emphasise, it is clear that people who think they are more or less fine do not consult a doctor, but those who have problems do – and this issue needs to be be addressed.
Now to electricity tariffs. The Amur Region is not isolated, as many Far Eastern regions are. On the whole, it is part of Siberia. Regarding what people write. We should simply check it. This information differs from what I have on the rates in neighbouring regions or on sales to the People's Republic of China. They write, “We sell to China for 50 kopecks per 1 kW. It is more expensive for us.” That is not true. The wholesale price for China is 3.5 rubles, if we count in rubles. It is the wholesale price. And the average price for Siberia is 1.8 rubles. The average retail price for businesses in Amur Region is 3.8 rubles. That is, the retail price is lower than the wholesale price for China. For reference, the average retail price in China is 8 rubles. The retail price for the population of Amur Region is 2.1 rubles. Is that so or not? Is it true?
Amur Region Governor Alexander Kozlov
: It is 2.4 rubles for homes with electric stoves and 0.2 higher for those with gas stoves.
Vladimir Putin: It is a bit lower than the average for Russia.
Alexander Kozlov: Yes, it is lower for us.
Vladimir Putin: As for other regions, I would like to use this opportunity to say that the electricity rates are significantly higher in the isolated Far Eastern regions. We have decided to make the average annual rate in 2017 closer, or even equal, to the average rate for Russia, which is around 4 rubles on average for the Russian Federation. It will all be re-calculated for your Far Eastern neighbours such as Kamchatka, Magadan, Yakutia, Sakhalin and Chukotka, because the decision was taken in July 2017. Kamchatka, for example, will be paying zero rates until November, Magadan will not be paying until September, Yakutia – until December, Sakhalin – until October, and Chukotka – until next May. It means that the neighbouring regions are in a more difficult situation than Amur Region is, but the corresponding decisions have already been made. They will be implemented shortly.
But all of this is ‘in passing’, as they say, it does not concern you directly. However, I would ask you to take a very serious look into all the other issues.
Alexander Kozlov: Of course.
