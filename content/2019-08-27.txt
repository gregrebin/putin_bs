Videoconference with the crew of the International Space Station.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
We would like to greet you and congratulate you on the results of your work today. We know this was not exactly a routine situation, but you did a great job, which is typical of our cosmonautics, of our cosmonauts. I hope everything will now go as smooth as butter, as we say in Russia.
However, it is as smooth as butter because of the high level of professionalism of top-tier specialists like you. Thank you very much. I wish you success. I hope Fyodor [the robot] will also give you the support and assistance you need in your serious, important and interesting work that we all need.
Thank you very much.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan (retranslated): Today I am here, at this wonderful air salon at the invitation of Mr Putin, my friend, and we have already seen much equipment and technology.
You are really performing a very impressive flight, doing a lot of work for the sake of your country. We are following you from here, from Earth. I believe and hope that you are a very good example for the young people that are watching you. You are doing a lot for these young people with this mission.
I would like to congratulate you on behalf of the Turkish nation. I wish you all the best. Let the rest of your journey be a success.
Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin: President Erdogan,
We met with a Turkish delegation this morning, and we have a joint proposal for you: to organise a space flight for a Turkish cosmonaut on the anniversary of the Republic [of Turkey]. The Cosmonaut Training Centre is ready for this. If you support it, we will begin immediately.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan: We will join in this work. I would like to express gratitude to you on behalf of my country once again. Thank you very much for what you have done.

News conference following Russian-Turkish talks
Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave a joint news conference on the Turkish President’s visit to Russia.

News conference following Russian-Turkish talks.
Vladimir Putin's statement for the press and answers to journalists’ questions
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President [Erdogan], my friend,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
First of all, I would like to thank the President of Turkey, Mr Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for accepting the invitation to be with us at the 14th MAKS-2019 International Aerospace Salon.
Mr President is accompanied by a delegation of high-ranking Turkish military, and industry and business representatives. Our guests from Turkey had a chance to see the achievements of the Russian aviation industry and watch the air show, which featured Su-35 multipurpose fighters, and the fifth-generation Su-57 fighter. We are also ready to offer flights on Su-30SM fighters to Turkish pilots.
We have certainly used Mr Erdogan’s visit to MAKS as an opportunity to hold bilateral talks and discuss, among other things, promising joint projects not only in aerospace, but also in other areas of military-technical cooperation. I am specifically referring to the contract with Turkey for the S-400 Triumph anti-aircraft weapon systems.
Obviously, our meeting was not limited to cooperation in military technology. We considered a variety of ways to pursue Russian-Turkish interaction, and we exchanged views on relevant topics on the international and regional agendas.
This is not the first visit by the Turkish President to Russia this year. In April, Mr Erdogan and I held a productive meeting of the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council in Moscow; we also met at other sites. In mid-September, I will go to Ankara for a trilateral summit of Russia, Turkey and Iran, guarantors of the Astana process for Syria. Mr Erdogan is also invited to take part in the Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow in October.
During the discussion of current international issues, primary attention was certainly given to the situation in Syria. Russia and Turkey cooperate closely in the Astana format along with Iran. We believe this format is the most effective tool for overcoming the crisis in Syria. We think that at this point the most important task is to focus on finally stabilising the situation on the ground and promoting a political settlement in conformity with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. In this context, Mr Erdogan and I discussed issues related to the creation and initiation of the Syrian Constitutional Committee that, we hope, will start functioning in Geneva soon.
Both our Turkish partners and we are seriously concerned about the situation in the Idlib de-escalation zone. The terrorists continue shelling Syrian government troop positions and trying to attack Russian military facilities. We are convinced that the de-escalation zone should not serve as a shelter for militants, or be a bridgehead for new attacks. In this context, the President of Turkey and I mapped out additional joint measures for neutralizing terrorist hotbeds in Idlib and normalizing the situation both in this zone and in the rest of Syria.
Mr President and I spoke about this today in detail and agreed on what we should do to resolve these issues together and how to do it. In this process, we proceed from the immutable principles of preserving the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, and the unacceptability of dividing it into spheres of influence.
We also discussed other regional issues, in part, a settlement in the Middle East and developments in Libya.
In general, we have managed to work well together here at the aerospace salon. I would like to thank Mr Erdogan for this, as well as all of our Turkish colleagues who, let me repeat, accepted our invitation. I hope this joint work will be a good impetus for developing Russian-Turkish relations in all the areas we discussed today.
Thank you.

Question (retranslated): Can you tell us anything about Turkey’s cooperation with America on creating a security zone?
Vladimir Putin: Turkey is shouldering a huge refugee load. We are well aware of this; there are more than 3 million people. Incidentally, normalization in Syria is prompting many people to return home. Over 300,000 refugees from abroad and 1 million internally displaced persons have returned to their homes. But we understand Turkey’s concern over the security of its southern borders. We believe these are the lawful concerns of the Republic of Turkey. Today, Mr President spoke in detail about this. He made his position clear, and in my opinion, very understandable.
We believe the creation of a security zone on the southern borders of the Republic of Turkey will help ensure the territorial integrity of Syria itself. In this respect, we support all measures aimed at de-escalation in this zone.
Question: You spent a lot of time today looking at the exposition in detail. I think Mr Putin showed Mr Erdogan almost the entire range of achievements of our aviation industry.
You also said that during your talks you discussed military-technical cooperation and mentioned that a regular delivery of the S-400 system took place today. Did you discuss any new contracts?
Vladimir Putin: I could hardly show all the achievements of Russia’s missile, space and aviation industry in such a short amount of time. We are proud of our advanced developments in this area and our new prototypes for arms and equipment, and not just military but also civilian produce.
We also demonstrated the MS-21, a new civilian aircraft, which, I believe, the President liked. Our friends liked the helicopters, especially the MI-38. These are light helicopters that are used, in part, for medical purposes. Mr President intends to carry out a large programme for the development of medical airlift services in Turkey. We also have plans like this on our agenda in Russia.
Thus, we talked not only about military or military-technical cooperation but also about civilian related cooperation, both in space and aviation. As for military aviation, we discussed cooperation on the Su-35 (generation 4++) and even on the new Su-57. We have many opportunities. We showed a new weapons system and a new system for radio electronic warfare. In my opinion, our Turkish partners were interested in many things. I am referring not just to procurement but also to joint production. Incidentally, we are open to this and, in certain areas, we will be actively discussing it with our partners.

Meeting with Russian vocational skills team
At the end of his trip to Kazan, the President met with WorldSkills Team Russia.

With WorldSkills Team Russia.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening.
I will not recapitulate the figures, you really know them better than I do. The only thing I would like to say is that you all did well.
I have just had a chat with the WorldSkills International leaders. They are delighted with both the organisation and the Russian team’s performance.
I will not repeat everything lest I appear immodest, but I know that your performance was tremendous; you achieved remarkable progress by comparison with the previous competitions at this level, and did so practically in all competencies.
We are proud of you. Good work! I think this will bring about a big qualitative change in your life and your professional careers. And this is a superb signal and an excellent example for all the other people who are choosing as good a vocation as yours.
I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart and wish you all every success. I hope – your age allows this, you are all quite young people – that you will participate again in competitions like this. But the most important thing is that you will later reveal at your places of work what the participation in WorldSkills and your awards are all about. You will show that these medals were not won by chance; you have earned them due to your talent, your work, industry and ambition – most importantly your ambition – to prove that in any business there are competencies that are, without any doubt, the top achievements in a profession.

Closing ceremony of WorldSkills competition

You are the living proof of what I have just said. Let me congratulate you once again. I wish you all the best and every success.
I would like to once again thank the organisers. Kazan did all that was required in order to create conditions for you and your fellow competitors. This is also an achievement, our scope of competence. We are displaying it in the best possible manner in all spheres, and in this one too. Kazan has shown a good example. I think St Petersburg will have to do an even much better job, given that it still has three years to go. Perhaps some of you will take part in it, we will see how this will look shortly.
Of course, we should not forget about your instructors and mentors, who paved the way to enable your advance towards success (I do not mean the team that organised the competitions). They certainly did well and I can see that they are present here. Let me bow down to all of you and your colleagues, who are working – or perhaps worked and continue to work – outside of the WorldSkills framework, but are doing their job at the highest level. This is extremely important.
Thank you.

Speech at the closing ceremony of the WorldSkills competition
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, ladies and gentlemen,
I wholeheartedly congratulate the winners and medallists of the 45th WorldSkills competition of vocational skills. We also appreciate the performance of all the participants. You demonstrated outstanding techniques and skills, which you have refined and honed to virtuoso heights.
This was the first time that Russia hosted a competition of the world’s best professionals, and it became the largest and most representative in the movement’s entire history, as well as a rewarding and memorable experience.
I am confident that our guests loved Kazan, a wonderful and rapidly developing city with a long history and modern achievements, where the best possible conditions have been created for a fair competition and friendly communication of visitors and participants from over 60 countries.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank once again the WorldSkills International movement and Mr Simon Bartley personally for his trust and support. Thank you very much. I would like to reaffirm our commitment to the WorldSkills values. In Russia, 500,000 people joined this movement, and the number of its supporters and participants is growing steadily.
In this country, WorldSkills has become a crucial element in an advanced system of vocational training we are establishing, including in digital economy categories. We are modifying our colleges and providing broad opportunities, without a parallel in the world, for young people to engage in technical creativity. We are glad that our best practices have proved highly relevant. Here in Kazan, school students competed in vocational skills for the first time in history. Contests in the competencies of the future have sparked huge interest as well.
Friends, the 45th WorldSkills competition is drawing to a close. Our common responsibility is to preserve and use its legacy for the benefit of citizens of all our countries so that each person, regardless of his or her age and health status, could realise their potential, choose their own path of training and development, and acquire highly needed skills throughout their lifetime.
Russia is open to a joint effort to establish an affordable and continuous personnel training model of this kind. In this way, we can jointly respond to challenges of the advancing technological era, ensure sustainable development, and create conditions for improving living standards. I am referring to large-scale and truly civilizational objectives. And, as I see it, their attainment represents a unifying and humane mission pursued by WorldSkills.
I am confident that the next WorldSkills competition scheduled to be held in 2021 in Shanghai will be an important step forward in promoting its principles. We are pleased to hand the relay baton to our Chinese friends.
And, of course, we will do our best to hold the European championship in St Petersburg in 2022 at the highest level. We look forward to seeing you in Russia again. We wish you every success and new victories.
Thank you, Tatarstan! Thank you, Kazan!

Beginning of Russian-Turkish talks in restricted format
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
First of all, I would like to thank you once again for accepting our invitation to visit the aerospace salon.
We have shown you a series of various products, both military and civilian. They not only demonstrate Russia’s capability in aerospace but also offer a variety of cooperation opportunities. We know about Turkey’s high-tech development plans. Of course, we could join forces in the areas where our capabilities are especially strong and sought after.
I am undoubtedly delighted to have this opportunity to meet with you today and to discuss our bilateral relations. There are many issues we can discuss, as we said before, and today you mentioned in your statement once again the prospects for cooperation with us, including on sensitive regional and international issues.
I am very happy to see you.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan (retranslated): My dear friend, Mr President,
I would like to thank you once again personally and on behalf of my country for your kind invitation.
Today we have taken a closer look at Russia’s defence industry. I would like to express satisfaction at the fact that today we also saw Russian-made engines for passenger liners, combat aircraft, helicopters and other aviation equipment. We also watched the demonstration flights of combat aircraft, including the Su-34, Su-35 and Su-57.
We have also been updated on Russia’s space activities and the measures you are taking to boost your space industry. Everyone knows that Russian researchers have reached very high standards in this sphere.
We have also held talks [via videoconference] with the space crew and wished them a successful mission.
I believe that we will be able to discuss various practical matters during our one-on-one meeting with Mr Putin and the subsequent talks.
Thank you very much.
