Videoconference with the crew of the International Space Station.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
We would like to greet you and congratulate you on the results of your work today. We know this was not exactly a routine situation, but you did a great job, which is typical of our cosmonautics, of our cosmonauts. I hope everything will now go as smooth as butter, as we say in Russia.
However, it is as smooth as butter because of the high level of professionalism of top-tier specialists like you. Thank you very much. I wish you success. I hope Fyodor [the robot] will also give you the support and assistance you need in your serious, important and interesting work that we all need.
Thank you very much.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan (retranslated): Today I am here, at this wonderful air salon at the invitation of Mr Putin, my friend, and we have already seen much equipment and technology.
You are really performing a very impressive flight, doing a lot of work for the sake of your country. We are following you from here, from Earth. I believe and hope that you are a very good example for the young people that are watching you. You are doing a lot for these young people with this mission.
I would like to congratulate you on behalf of the Turkish nation. I wish you all the best. Let the rest of your journey be a success.
Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin: President Erdogan,
We met with a Turkish delegation this morning, and we have a joint proposal for you: to organise a space flight for a Turkish cosmonaut on the anniversary of the Republic [of Turkey]. The Cosmonaut Training Centre is ready for this. If you support it, we will begin immediately.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan: We will join in this work. I would like to express gratitude to you on behalf of my country once again. Thank you very much for what you have done.
