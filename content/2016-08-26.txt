The Kremlin, Moscow
With Acting Head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kadyrov, let’s discuss the socioeconomic situation, as usual: how are things in the Chechen Republic, and what results have you achieved? Tell us please about the sport achievements – I have recently watched some good martial arts competitions.
Acting Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov
: Mr President, we have made good progress of late: this year, in the first six months, industrial output grew by 11.6 percent, and agricultural production by 7.4 percent. Talking of agriculture and import replacement, we recently launched a dairy farm for 1,200 dairy cows and a fodder centre for 4,000 head of cattle.
Unemployment decreased this year, falling to no more than 1.3 percent after we created about 5,000 jobs.
The situation is stable, and crime rate low, especially with regard to the serious and very serious crimes such as terrorism.
We are faithfully fulfilling the May executive orders, in particular, we have raised teachers’ salaries. Chechnya is one of the top five Russian regions in the implementation of the May executive orders.
We are also well prepared for the new school year: we have opened 19 more schools this year that will serve 9,600 students. On your instruction, we are determined to completely resolve educational issues in the next few years. As for preschools for children aged three to seven, we have 100 percent enrolment, with no waiting lists. Previously, you remember when we had no kindergartens at all, that was a major problem, but now we have resolved this issue completely.
This year we finish the first programme to move people out of dilapidated and unsafe buidings: about 4,000 people will receive housing, more than 15,000 square metres. So we are gradually addressing problems, but of course we need your involvement and support to be able to handle them – there are issues that require your intervention.
Vladimir Putin: Let's see.
I know that you are developing sport and preparing for the Russian judo championships.
Ramzan Kadyrov: We have recently organised our local judo championship. Our team, our club Edelweiss won. They defeated all other clubs, even famous ones.
We promote judo and other kinds of sport. We can say it is our priority. I hope that one day you will visit to watch a training practice.
Vladimir Putin: I will be happy to come. Thank you very much.
