President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear friends,
There are special moments and days in every person’s life. I am convinced that all those who will now receive state decorations will remember this ceremony and the ceremonial presentation in the Kremlin. They will also remember the pleasures of interacting with the worthy, brilliant people gathered here today. Each of you has made a significant contribution to Russia’s development and rightly deserves the greatest respect and recognition.
Your achievements and successes are the outcomes of profound knowledge, inspiration, hard labour, and purposeful efforts. These qualities guarantee leadership in any activity. No doubt, you belong to a class of leaders, that is enterprising dynamic people, ready to tackle the most complex tasks.
Each of you has their own destiny, victories and exploits – of labour or in the battlefield – but you are united by one most important thing. You serve, work, and create for Russia’s prosperity. You love your country, and this love gives your deeds and accomplishments special purpose of generating benefits for our people and our Motherland.
The lives of our war veterans are distinguished by the extent to which they are permeated with the love of the Fatherland. Their country’s interests and the protection of their native land gave them their fundamental, invincible force. It gives me great pleasure today to present an award to a front-line soldier, retired Lieutenant General Dmitry Mikhailik, whose biography is truly legendary.
At the front since 1942, and thrice wounded, he personally raised a battalion to attacks, and went alone on missions to destroy enemy firing points. Lieutenant General Mikhailik is now awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky for his courage and heroism during the [Second World] War years.
”Each of you has their own destiny, victories and exploits – of labour or in the battlefield – but you are united by one most important thing. You serve, work, and create for Russia’s prosperity. You love your country, and this love gives your deeds and accomplishments special purpose of generating benefits for our people and our Motherland.“
The younger generation of defenders of our Motherland preserves and enriches the glorious traditions of their fathers and grandfathers. They include commander of a special rapid reaction unit of the Department of the Interior for Perm Territory, Police Colonel Sergei Yashkin. Mr Yashkin has been awarded the title of Hero of Russia for his bravery and exemplary performance of important tasks.
Police Major Yury Sedykh has been awarded the Order of Courage. Risking his own life, he detained an armed, ruthless criminal who murdered peaceful, innocent people. We remember the tragedy that took place in Belgorod, and we are thankful to everyone who participated in the operation to neutralise the criminal. Police Major Sedykh played a crucial role in this regard. It is precisely such officers that honourably perform their duty, and thereby increase people’s trust in the police and raise its public profile.
The eminent paediatric surgeon Leonid Roshal has devoted himself to serving others, and caring for children’s health. His name is well-known in our country and abroad. The so-called World’s Doctor is a man with a well-developed conscience and moral sense. He has been in medicine more than sixty years now, and has saved thousands of lives, often in difficult and emergency situations.
There are stars of Russian science among those decorated today: academicians Yury Osipov, Ivan Dedov, Gennady Sakovich and Taliya Khabriyeva.
I am also glad to see well-known cultural figures here: Ilya Reznik, Sergei Goryayev, Tatyana Vasilyeva, Alexei Guskov.
I congratulate the representatives of leading Russian companies who have received state decorations. The results of your energetic work directly influence labour productivity, the use of high-tech in manufacturing, and generally improve the competitiveness of Russia’s economy. I am sure that the teams with whom you work share your joy and success.
Once again, let me congratulate all those who received state decorations today, and therefore a high degree of societal recognition – the recognition of your talent, your work and your success. I wish you further great achievements.
Thank you for your attention.

At the meeting on developing the Moscow aviation hub.
The meeting looked at forming a common strategy for developing Moscow’s aviation hub, improving its management structure and developing public-private partnership mechanisms.
The meeting’s participants included senior officials from the Presidential Executive Office and Government, and the heads of a number of ministries, agencies, regions, and companies.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear colleagues,
Today we will discuss the prospects for developing the Moscow aviation hub. Our task is to transform it into a modern, international air traffic centre, a state-of-the-art one, and to make sure that it meets the highest standards for global air transport infrastructure. This is a key factor in realising our investment, transit and tourism potential. It is also an incentive to create additional jobs and represents yet another step strengthening the position of Moscow as a major global scientific, cultural and business centre.
In recent years much has been done to improve the quality of Moscow’s main airports: Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo. They now have modern passenger terminals and airfield infrastructure has been upgraded. In turn, the airports’ capacity has markedly increased. In terms of passenger traffic, the Moscow aviation hub is among the ten largest in the world, and it continues to grow rapidly.
In these conditions, our main task is to ensure that Moscow’s airports operate efficiently and smoothly, provide reliable transport connectivity across the entire country, and act as a strong link in international transport routes.
Experience demonstrates that global competitiveness depends on increasing the number of flights, convenient connections and fast customs procedures. All this can be effectively organised within a major aviation complex.
”Our task is to transform it into a modern, international air traffic centre. This is a key factor in realising our investment, transit and tourism potential. It is another step strengthening the position of Moscow as a major global scientific, cultural and business centre.“
We have already discussed creating such a complex on the basis of the Moscow aviation hub, and have agreed to implement new approaches to organising operation of Moscow airports in order to ensure the synchronous development of their infrastructure, improve the transparency and effectiveness of investing public funds, and ultimately generate assets that are attractive for private investors.
I know that there are several opinions on the prospect strategy of developing the Moscow aviation hub. Today I suggest that all of you, dear colleagues, express your views on this issue, keeping in mind the following considerations.
First, we must carefully consider all organisational and financial aspects of developing the Moscow aviation hub. Currently, operation conditions for different airports vary, same as relationships with each particular operator, therefore the transparency of airport ownership and the prospect planning are particularly important.
It is essential that all participants of the [airports development] project fall under Russian jurisdiction and that the beneficial owners are clear. It is important to clearly understand who will fund the development of airport infrastructure, at whose expense, to what extent, and to know who is responsible for what in the end.
Second, it is inadmissible to shift costs incurred onto passengers, so I would suggest that this meeting’s participants speak to this issue too. We need clear sources of funding so that costs do not end up, as I just said, falling to passengers themselves.
Third, activities to develop the airfield infrastructure of the Moscow aviation hub are set out in the federal target programme on transport development. Necessary budgetary funds have been allocated, appropriate time frames have been determined, and work on other airport facilities depends on them. I would ask you to assume that the schedule will be followed to the minute.
And the fourth point, plans to develop airports must be fully coordinated with Moscow and the Moscow Region’s plans to improve infrastructure around airports. We must develop the Moscow aviation hub in close coordination and along with building and improving roads and railways leading to airports.
In this respect it is crucially important to develop a common language between airports, infrastructure companies and government agencies, and to coordinate joint actions. Today I would like to hear how you propose to do so.
Let’s get to work.
