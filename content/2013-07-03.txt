President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear friends,
There are special moments and days in every person’s life. I am convinced that all those who will now receive state decorations will remember this ceremony and the ceremonial presentation in the Kremlin. They will also remember the pleasures of interacting with the worthy, brilliant people gathered here today. Each of you has made a significant contribution to Russia’s development and rightly deserves the greatest respect and recognition.
Your achievements and successes are the outcomes of profound knowledge, inspiration, hard labour, and purposeful efforts. These qualities guarantee leadership in any activity. No doubt, you belong to a class of leaders, that is enterprising dynamic people, ready to tackle the most complex tasks.
Each of you has their own destiny, victories and exploits – of labour or in the battlefield – but you are united by one most important thing. You serve, work, and create for Russia’s prosperity. You love your country, and this love gives your deeds and accomplishments special purpose of generating benefits for our people and our Motherland.
The lives of our war veterans are distinguished by the extent to which they are permeated with the love of the Fatherland. Their country’s interests and the protection of their native land gave them their fundamental, invincible force. It gives me great pleasure today to present an award to a front-line soldier, retired Lieutenant General Dmitry Mikhailik, whose biography is truly legendary.
At the front since 1942, and thrice wounded, he personally raised a battalion to attacks, and went alone on missions to destroy enemy firing points. Lieutenant General Mikhailik is now awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky for his courage and heroism during the [Second World] War years.
”Each of you has their own destiny, victories and exploits – of labour or in the battlefield – but you are united by one most important thing. You serve, work, and create for Russia’s prosperity. You love your country, and this love gives your deeds and accomplishments special purpose of generating benefits for our people and our Motherland.“
The younger generation of defenders of our Motherland preserves and enriches the glorious traditions of their fathers and grandfathers. They include commander of a special rapid reaction unit of the Department of the Interior for Perm Territory, Police Colonel Sergei Yashkin. Mr Yashkin has been awarded the title of Hero of Russia for his bravery and exemplary performance of important tasks.
Police Major Yury Sedykh has been awarded the Order of Courage. Risking his own life, he detained an armed, ruthless criminal who murdered peaceful, innocent people. We remember the tragedy that took place in Belgorod, and we are thankful to everyone who participated in the operation to neutralise the criminal. Police Major Sedykh played a crucial role in this regard. It is precisely such officers that honourably perform their duty, and thereby increase people’s trust in the police and raise its public profile.
The eminent paediatric surgeon Leonid Roshal has devoted himself to serving others, and caring for children’s health. His name is well-known in our country and abroad. The so-called World’s Doctor is a man with a well-developed conscience and moral sense. He has been in medicine more than sixty years now, and has saved thousands of lives, often in difficult and emergency situations.
There are stars of Russian science among those decorated today: academicians Yury Osipov, Ivan Dedov, Gennady Sakovich and Taliya Khabriyeva.
I am also glad to see well-known cultural figures here: Ilya Reznik, Sergei Goryayev, Tatyana Vasilyeva, Alexei Guskov.
I congratulate the representatives of leading Russian companies who have received state decorations. The results of your energetic work directly influence labour productivity, the use of high-tech in manufacturing, and generally improve the competitiveness of Russia’s economy. I am sure that the teams with whom you work share your joy and success.
Once again, let me congratulate all those who received state decorations today, and therefore a high degree of societal recognition – the recognition of your talent, your work and your success. I wish you further great achievements.
Thank you for your attention.
