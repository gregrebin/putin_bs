Vladimir Putin wished a happy holiday to Russian women on International Women’s Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear women of Russia,
Please accept my heartfelt greetings on International Women’s Day.
We celebrate this holiday in the very beginning of spring. The weather may vary today across our big country but the spring spirit is everywhere. It is in the smiles, flowers and sincere emotions all around us.
All this is for you, ladies. We are happy to have such a wonderful occasion to express again our deep respect for you, our enchantment with your beauty and tenderness.
Men today are presenting you with heartfelt gifts; they are wishing a happy holiday to mothers, grandmothers, wives, daughters, girlfriends and colleagues.
Only women can create a welcoming atmosphere at work and at home, take care of our homes and children every day and be a moral example to them.
We know that a woman’s heart is the most loyal, her forgiveness the most powerful. And we know that a mother’s love is truly boundless.
To raise a child is a joy and a responsibility, which makes the hard work of mothers of large families even more valuable, including those mothers who give warmth and happiness to adopted children.
Woman is the kind and serene figure in every man’s life. Countless works of art are dedicated to women. And a beautiful tradition of reciting poems for women on March 8 is taking shape in our country.
(Vladimir Putin recites a poem dedicated to women by a Soviet poet.)
Happy International Women’s Day. Be loved and be happy!
