Meeting with President of Kyrgyzstan Sooronbay Jeenbekov.
President of Kyrgyzstan Sooronbay Jeenbekov
: Mr President,
Welcome to the Kyrgyz Republic. We are always happy to see you in Kyrgyzstan.
People in this country know you as a close and true friend, and we are always happy to welcome you.
Our relations have acquired very active dynamics, and we are collaborating in all spheres. I am convinced that our fruitful cooperation will continue in the spirit of allied relations and strategic partnership.
I am glad that you have arrived for this event [the CSTO summit].
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for the invitation and for what you have been doing throughout 2019 to develop the Collective Security Treaty Organisation
during your presidency of our regional and, in my opinion, very important organization.
I would like to point out that Kyrgyzstan has displayed leadership in numerous aspects that we consider important for expanding bilateral relations and in the context of regional cooperation.
Regarding bilateral relations, they are also developing quite successfully. We fully confirm the quality of our relations.
This quality is marked by true strategic partnership. One can call it allied relations, and this is reflected in all spheres, including interstate and political relations. We cooperate very actively on the international arena, we are grateful to you for supporting a number of our initiatives at the UN and at other venues.
As for the economy, Russia ranks among the leaders in this respect in its contacts with Kyrgyzstan. In 2018, our trade increased by over 17 percent. Indicatively, your exports to Russia (our imports) soared by 22 percent, and this is an obvious plus for Kyrgyzstan. In effect, your exports to Russia are growing faster than the overall trade volumes.
Direct Russian investment in the economy of Kyrgyzstan is estimated at $200 million, and about 700 of our companies, including joint ventures and those with 100 percent Russian capital, operate on the Kyrgyz market.
I am very happy to have this opportunity to see you once again on the sidelines of today’s international meeting.
