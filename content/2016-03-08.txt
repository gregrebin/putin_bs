Congratulations to Russia’s women on March 8.
Vladimir Putin: Dear women,
From all my heart, I congratulate you on International Women’s Day. Russia celebrates this holiday with particular love, probably more so than any other country. It is a holiday filled with gifts and flowers and with our warmest, fondest feelings for our mothers, wives, daughters, colleagues and all the women close to our hearts. After all, it is women who give us life and warm us with their love, support and care. It is women, with their dignity and compassion, who incarnate Russia’s true soul.
I want to say particular words of gratitude today to the women of the wartime generation. Your strength of spirit and your feats taught us to be real men and reach victory in spite of all the obstacles. Today’s women follow in your footsteps, succeeding in every field, in professional and creative careers and public work, and create a happy and comfortable environment for founding families and raising children.
Dear women, you possess a mysterious power: you keep up with everything, juggle a myriad of tasks, and yet remain tender, unforgettable and full of charm. You bring goodness and beauty, hope and light into this world. We are proud of you and we love you.
Once again, let me congratulate you sincerely on this holiday. I wish you days and years filled with joy. I wish you happiness.
