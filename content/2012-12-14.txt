President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam President, ladies and gentlemen,
Today we had very informative and constructive talks. We discussed key aspects of Russian-Brazilian cooperation and urgent international and regional issues. Particular emphasis was placed on enhancing business cooperation and partnership.
Russia and Brazil are expanding cooperation in energy, engineering, agriculture and in innovative sectors such as aircraft engineering, space exploration, IT and biotechnology, research and education, and training highly qualified professionals.
Last year, bilateral trade grew by over 10% to $6.5 billion. It is continuing to grow this year: in the first nine months of 2012 trade rose more than 7%. However, we cannot be satisfied with the absolute figures and our goal is to reach not less than $10 billion in the nearest future.
“The principle of expanding our partnership on the basis of quality is reflected in the documents signed today. These documents aim to strengthen industrial cooperation, expand bilateral economic and trade relations, and promote interaction in advanced science-intensive industries.”
The principle of expanding our partnership on the basis of quality is reflected in the documents signed today: the joint statement on the intensification of Russian-Brazilian cooperation, as well as an updated action plan of strategic partnership and a number of industry documents. You all saw them.
These documents aim to strengthen industrial cooperation, expand bilateral economic and trade relations, and promote interaction in advanced science-intensive industries. One of our main objectives is to promote investment cooperation and to introduce widespread use of our national currencies – the ruble and the real – in bilateral payments. This will make business cooperation between our two countries more resistant to shocks in the global economy and help build up strong technological ties between our companies.
In this regard I would like to mention the Russian-Brazilian business forum held today, which was attended by representatives of large national companies. Direct dialogue between our business communities is the most important condition for the successful development of business cooperation.
The number of joint projects is growing in all sectors. Production cooperation in aircraft and automobile engineering is expanding. In turn, we have seen an increase in the inflow of Russian investments in the Brazilian economy and of Brazilian investments in the Russian economy. Although the figures are still modest, we very much hope that we will see dramatic changes in the near future. There are ambitious plans and good projects that will generate hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars.
Cooperation in the humanitarian sphere has special importance for Russia and Brazil as countries with rich, unique cultures. A branch of the Bolshoi Theatre ballet school is open in the state of Santa Catarina, and Brazilian dancers, this school’s graduates, performed yesterday in the Swan Lake production at the Bolshoi. Madam President had the opportunity to enjoy their performance and appreciate their talent.
Our future plans feature the expansion of ties in research and education. We are ready to participate in Brazil’s national Science without Borders programme. We hope that many such programmes will be implemented jointly, and a program such as Science without Borders will play an important part in our partnership, and many Brazilian students will come to Russian universities to continue their education.
“Russia and Brazil share common approaches to key international issues with due regard for the central and coordinating role of the United Nations and the norms and principles of international law.”
In the coming years, Russia, and Brazil will host major sporting events: the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cups. We have agreed to establish the closest possible cooperation, including the exchange of experience and professional training, security and logistics.
During today’s meeting we also discussed international issues. Russia and Brazil are strategic partners in the United Nations, BRICS
and the G20. We are interested in deepening cooperation through regional integration associations.
Russia and Brazil share common approaches to key international issues with due regard for the central and coordinating role of the United Nations and the norms and principles of international law.
In conclusion, I want to thank the President of Brazil and all our Brazilian colleagues and friends for today’s joint efforts. Thank you for your attention.
