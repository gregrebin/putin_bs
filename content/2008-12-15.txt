President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Grigory Alexeyevich, as you know, I started work a while ago on building a personnel reserve for the country. This is a crucial area, but one that has not come in for significant development over recent years.
Now it is time to give this work a systematic basis rather than just acting in ad hoc fashion. Proposals are being drafted and by the end of the year we will make the main decisions on how to organise this work and how this system will function.
I know that you too, in your capacity as plenipotentiary envoy, have been working on these matters too on my instruction, and so I would like to hear from you now about the current state of progress. As far as I know, you have a number of personnel proposals, and we can also discuss them now.
Plenipotentiary Presidential Envoy In the Volga Federal District Grigory Rapota: Dmitry Anatolyevich, we have work underway at two levels on this matter. At regional level — in the district’s republics and regions — the personnel reserve is already in place, and we have also drawn up a proposal for the federal personnel reserve.
We have already submitted this first proposal and have tried to keep it in line with the criteria you spoke about. I think it puts forward worthy people.
Dmitry Medvedev: This is very good, because we need to put together a data base. This does not mean that everyone who ends up on the lists will automatically get propelled upwards and become big bosses, but we need to have a choice before us, this is absolutely clear, and there needs to be a normal competitive environment so that we can select the most competent, responsible and best qualified people.
Grigory Rapota: We have a lot of capable and energetic young people in our district able to take on the most important missions.
Dmitry Medvedev: I am certain you have.
Grigory Rapota: So, I think in this respect we will be able to put on a good showing.
Dmitry Medvedev: You can tell me about some of them now.
Grigory Rapota: Yes, thank you.
