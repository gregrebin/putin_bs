Before the conversation began, Vladimir Putin, and the head of the educational Talent and Success Foundation Yelena Shmeleva, visited a residential complex for students at the Sirius Presidential Lyceum, examined the display stands at the lyceum complex construction project and saw models of new buildings. The new five-floor dormitory has 132 rooms for 250 pupils and tutors.
The Sirius Presidential Lyceum opened on September 1, 2020. It includes a school with grades 1–11, and preschool groups for children aged 2–7. The learning process includes general education, extracurricular activities and self-training, as well as more than 200 elective programmes in engineering, the social sciences and humanities, natural science, art and physical fitness and sports.

Yelena Shmeleva
, Head of the Talent and Success Foundation, moderator: Good afternoon, colleagues, Mr President.
Mr President, we are very grateful to you for these meetings that regularly take place at Sirius, because it is a good opportunity for teachers and students to discuss interesting and important issues.
As we are meeting at the Presidential Lyceum, we are certainly eager to talk about what we are doing and how our programmes are growing. The lyceum is already three years old; it is serving 1,500 students from grades 1 to 11 and has a preschool department. This new residential building has been developed on your instructions. It accommodates 250 children, the students in specialised programmes, and we would certainly like to develop these programmes further, including at our new school for 3,000 students, which we are also building.
However, Mr President, I am getting ahead of myself. I would like to give my colleagues an opportunity to tell us exactly how we did it, what we designed and what we expect from this new school of ours on the federal territory.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Please.
But, you know, before we begin, I would like to say that I think tomorrow is Teachers’ Day.
Yelena Shmeleva: Yes.
Vladimir Putin: I would like to congratulate all the mentors, educators, and teachers in Russia on this day, through you, as they usually say in these cases. And I want to wish everyone all the best in their professional journey, and I hope that everything is fine at home with our mentors. This is not a profession but a mission, we all understand this.
Every person, no matter where and what they do, no matter where they live and no matter what age group they belong to, always remembers what their school, their teachers and mentors gave them. Therefore, a low bow to you and Happy Teachers’ Day.
I would also like to congratulate you on your new site. The Lyceum is progressing; a nice and beautiful campus has appeared. Ms. Shmeleva was just talking about this; she basically talked about what has been done here and what is planned.

Meeting with the winners of the Teacher of the Year national competition (via videoconference).
The Teacher of the Year national competition has been held annually since 1992 (in 1990–1991, it was held as the USSR Teacher of the Year). The competition was founded by the Ministry of Education, the National Union of Educators, and Uchitelskaya Gazeta newspaper. Ninety competitors took part in 2023’s national finale.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, or should I say good evening already.
I would like to greet you and, of course, congratulate you and, through you, all educators and citizens in our country on Teacher's Day.
This is more than a professional day. It is near and dear to almost all people in our country, everyone who is studying and teaching now, and everyone who went to school at some point. I would like to thank all of you for your hard work, care, and your generous hearts when it comes to children, and I wish you every success in your work.
Of course, I would like to congratulate the finalists and winners of the amazing Teacher of the Year competition on your excellent results – and not just congratulate you but wish you success as well. This is a spectacular and, hopefully, an intermediary result in your efforts because I am sure more achievements will follow, as your ideas and innovations have received well-deserved recognition among your colleagues and the entire education community. Since your ideas have received such recognition, they deserve to be promoted and implemented in the broadest sense of the word.
It is gratifying to know that the tight-knit team of participants and finalists in these competitions now includes educators from the Donetsk and Lugansk republics and the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Supporting the education systems in these regions is of major importance. We have been focusing on this and will continue to do so.
We should help our colleagues catch up and do everything to help schoolchildren and teachers feel part of the vast and shared educational space of our large country.
Best teaching practices and advanced techniques should be put to good use in these regions and the rest of the country, and teachers should be able to continue to learn as well. We often hear the same principles expressed over and over in every field and industry, that we all must continue to learn, upgrade our skills, and improve our mastery. This undoubtedly applies to teachers, perhaps even more so than to anyone else.
Your expertise as recognised leaders in your profession – I am addressing this audience now – and your creative and innovative approaches and potential are highly valuable and sought-after. Of course, I very much hope, and this is a good tradition in educational competitions, that you will become mentors for your colleagues as well. This should not sound offensive to anyone, because you have demonstrated your potential, and you should and can share your knowledge, expertise, and creative ideas with your colleagues. Again, no one should be offended if these achievements and proposals are shared with your colleagues.
We – and you are well aware of this – are striving to pay more attention to the material aspects of education. New schools are being built, and existing schools are being renovated, and textbooks and curricula are being updated. This work, especially when it comes to the content of the educational process, will undoubtedly benefit from your direct participation.
I hope that today you will share your assessments of what has been accomplished lately, your suggestions, and your vision of the future of education in Russia.
I congratulate you once again and wish you all the best. We are ready to support your ideas and suggestions. I see Minister [of Education] Sergei Kravtsov on the screen, and we have Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova who is in charge of these matters with us, and Andrei Fursenko, the former Minister who now works in the Presidential Executive Office is here as well.
Please, go ahead.
