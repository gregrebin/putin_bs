President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
We maintain regular contacts on all issues on the bilateral agenda and on regional matters. However, there are always a lot of topics to discuss – it is clear, given the intense nature of our dialogue.
At the beginning of our conversation in a bilateral format, I would like to note a significant growth in trade between our countries last year, as well as the continuing flow of investment. We have continued our vigorous joint efforts to resolve the Karabakh issue – now in a trilateral format together with our partners in Azerbaijan.
There are quite a few outstanding issues and I am happy that the two of us have this opportunity to meet and discuss all of them.
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan
: Thank you.
Mr President, allow me again to thank you for organising the anniversary CSTO Summit and for the traditionally hospitable and warm reception.
Of course, the 30th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation is a remarkable and very important event for us. I believe we had a really substantive conversation. It is very important that this conversation is forward-looking and focused on the further development of our Organisation.
It has been less than a month since my first official visit to the Russian Federation, when we also had a very substantive conversation. However, you were right in saying that our bilateral agenda is so busy that we could meet even more often for discussions. Of course, we always stay in contact with each other and speak by phone regularly.
As regards the economy, I also want to note that since last March, after a certain slump, there have been signs that our bilateral economic ties are gaining momentum and, of course, we see that Russian businesses are interested in investing in Armenia. I know that you are also encouraging Russian business people to invest in Armenia, and I want to thank you for that.
Of course, I hope and I am sure that today we will also discuss regional security and stability, the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement issue, as we noted in our joint statement, and also the role of the Co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group. I would like to share some information with you and discuss this issue as well. Again, thank you for the reception.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
