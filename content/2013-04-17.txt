President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Michel, it is a great pleasure to see you.
We agreed quite a while back on this meeting and I am very happy that you have found the time to come here.
I know that you are busy right now preparing big European events, and I am very pleased to see the development in our relations not only with FIFA but also with UEFA.
I hope very much that we will find our place in your plans. By ‘we’ I mean our football organisations and teams, and I mean not just fitting in with your plans in the organisational sense, but also having the chance to show just what our football is capable of and how it is developing.
Uefa President Michel Platini (translated from Russian): Thank you very much for meeting with me, Mr President, and not only with me, but also with my colleague from the FIFA Executive Committee, Mr Mutko.
We have already taken this opportunity to visit together the training centre for Russian athletes and also look around the facilities being built for the Sochi Winter Olympics.
To be honest, I would be more interested in seeing the stadium that will be built for the 2018 [football] World Cup. That is my professional interest speaking. 
I can see in any case that the work is moving full steam ahead. I also take this opportunity to congratulate former and now once-again member of FIFA Mr Mutko on his re-election for a four-year term. 
You remember that we met recently with [FIFA President] Mr Blatter and discussed various clubs’ fans. You said then that you hoped Mr Mutko would remain on the FIFA Executive Committee. 
As you can see, everything has turned out perfectly. My good friend Vitaly [Mutko] did not even have to take part in an election as the number of candidates was exactly the same as the number of seats to be filled.
Once again, I want to thank you for finding the time to meet, and I want to express my admiration for Russian football, which we will see at the World Cup in Brazil. You have a great coach and excellent players – as you showed against Brazil. Russian football has excellent future prospects. 
I take this opportunity to compliment Vitaly and yourself on the Russian Football Union, which is doing an excellent job.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for these kind words about our football. Coming from an expert like yourself an assessment such as this is especially pleasing to hear. 
Michel Platini: You know very well that in sport, it is absolutely decisive whose territory a match or competition takes place on. The results in this case speak for themselves.
Vladimir Putin: I hope this will be the case.
Thank you very much for supporting our sports minister, Mr Mutko, in the international organisations. I think that he will learn French in a sign of his gratitude. He already learned English and can learn French now. He and I will start learning it together. 
Michel Platini: He has already made a nice start and already knows the French for “good afternoon”, “here’s to your health”, and “that’s a decent sized purse” – that’s a French proverb.
Vladimir Putin: He probably knows another French saying – “Cherchez la femme.” Everyone here knows that one.

Before screening of Legenda No. 17. With the filmmakers.
Other guests at the pre-premiere screening included Soviet hockey stars Alexei Kasatonov, Sergei Makarov, Vladimir Petrov, Vladislav Tretyak, Vyacheslav Fetisov and the son of the famous hockey player, Alexander Kharlamov, as well as members of the Russian national junior hockey team.
The screening was also attended by International Olympic Committee Coordination Commission Chairman Jean-Claude Killy, President of the International Ice Hockey Federation Rene Fasel, figure skating coach Tatiana Tarasova, filmmakers and actors that play the main characters.
After the film, Vladimir Putin thanked the filmmakers and shared his impressions with the athletes. The President also congratulated one of the young hockey players on his birthday and gave him a wristwatch as a present.
Valery Kharlamov (born in 1948, died in a car accident in 1981) was an outstanding Soviet hockey player, a left-winger for the USSR national team (1969–1980), two-time winner of the Olympic Games (1972, 1976) and eight-time winner of the IIHF World Championship.

Speech before screening of Legenda No. 17
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear guests,
Our national junior team consists of young men under 18 years of age, and tomorrow is the start of the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. We felt that today is the right day for presenting this new film made by our cinematographers about our outstanding hockey player.
I am confident that everyone present here today knows who Kharlamov was and knows why he is referred to as Legenda No. 17. But I don’t think that everyone (other than members of his family and others whom we also rightly call world hockey stars) knows that the main feature that made him a legend was his character. Because when he was a child, doctors gave him a grave diagnosis: a heart disorder. Not only did he overcome this, he became an outstanding player both on our team and in world hockey.
There are many people here who worked with him, who – I can say without exaggeration – fought with him, trained with him and trained him. I mean there are no outsiders here, no people who don’t understand what ice hockey is all about.
I am sure that once this film is released to the general public, it will be popular among hockey fans, sports fans, and others who are simply proud of our nation’s achievements. And Kharlamov was one of those who demonstrated our nation’s successes and its greatness.
Tomorrow, our junior hockey team will begin competing in the world championships. I am confident that today’s event, the screening of this film, will motivate our young players to represent our nation with honour at the championships.
And I would like to thank the creative team for taking on this work and, judging by responses from experts and critics, doing an excellent, artistic job. Today, we will see for ourselves if it is true.
Let’s all thank them.
