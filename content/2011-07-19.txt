News conference following Russian-German interstate consultations. With Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.
The talks covered a broad range of issues, in particular the development of relations between Russia and the European Union, the activities of the Russia-NATO Council, European security, the deployment of missile defence in Europe, as well as the possibility of expanding Russian gas supplies following the commissioning of the Nord Stream gas pipeline. The organisation of the Year of Germany in Russia and the Year of Russia in Germany in 2012 and 2013 was discussed separately.
The official welcoming ceremony for the Russian head of state was held before the start of interstate consultations. Dmitry Medvedev and Angela Merkel walked through the guard of honour and welcomed members of the two countries’ delegations.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms Merkel, first of all I would like to thank you for choosing the welcoming Hannover as a venue for our meeting. The weather is beautiful and the place is gorgeous. And even the table of this size — I cannot remember where I have seen such a table: you can ride a bicycle straight from one end to another.
I hope that everyone can hear us, because we're not just going to get a bite to eat but will also talk about the development of the Russian-German strategic partnership.
”Most importantly, investment has been growing: German businesses have invested $10.5 billion in the Russian economy, and Russian companies invested about $5 billion in Germany in 2010.“
During this year, which started with consultations in Yekaterinburg, we have confirmed the traditions that were laid many years ago and at the same time continued our frank exchanges of opinions.
We have just attended the Petersburg Dialogue forum. In my opinion, it was interesting, lively and fun, which is truly important for such venues, for people not to fall asleep, and at the same time it was devoted to the most topical issues that unite our civil societies, issues that are sometimes controversial but also very relevant.

Press statement and answers to questions at a news conference following Russian-German interstate consultations
July 19, 2011
Today, during the 13th round of Russian-German interstate consultations our ministers will explore bilateral cooperation issues, given that they are already in constant contact and their interaction is not interrupted for the consultations but, on the contrary, continues in a working mode.
The state of Russian-German relations is good, we have already talked about it, there is growth in trade, which according to German figures this year may reach the level of around 60 billion euros, and according to our statistics about $70 billion, which is a milestone.
Most importantly, investment has been growing: German businesses have invested $10.5 billion in the Russian economy, and Russian companies invested about $5 billion in Germany in 2010. This means that investments are sustainable and have high volumes.
I cannot but note the active efforts of the working group on strategic cooperation in the economy and finance, and its support for our core business projects.
”The state of Russian-German relations is good, we have already talked about it, there is growth in trade, which according to German figures this year may reach the level of around 60 billion euros, and according to our statistics about $70 billion.“
Partnership for modernisation has been of particular importance and become a priority in recent years. I think the promotion of partnership for modernisation was also in the spotlight at the meeting with business leaders today. I'm glad that it is not just a nice idea but is embodied in a number of absolutely tangible, specific projects to be implemented at the Skolkovo Innovation Centre and in other places.
We are currently holding the Russian-German Year of Education, Science and Innovation, as agreed. In this sense it is a very relevant theme.
We have our traditional areas of cooperation, such as energy, which we have already talked about today. Incidentally, this autumn we will commission the first section of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which I hope will significantly improve the reliability of blue fuel supplies from Russia to Europe and will strengthen the energy security of the European continent as a whole.
We must tackle the issue of effective gas deliveries to final consumers, and there are a number of organisational problems, which I think our colleagues in the Government will still talk about today.
In any case, we must look to the future, look at those strategic alliances that have already been formed and think about how they will change to reflect the development of the situation, for example, the alliance between Rosatom and Siemens in the context of the German energy market. Therefore, we need to understand what will happen in this area next.
”Partnership for modernisation has been of particular importance and become a priority in recent years. I'm glad that it is not just a nice idea but is embodied in a number of absolutely tangible, specific projects to be implemented at the Skolkovo Innovation Centre and in other places.“
Humanitarian ties are continuing to develop, we will hold the Years of Russia in Germany in 2012 and the Year of Germany in Russian in 2013. It is an ambitious project and I hope it will give our people an insight into the life and achievements of Russia and Germany. It will facilitate exchanges among young people, academics and businesses.
Cooperation in the international arena is in our common interest. Yesterday we talked about Libya all evening, as well as the situation in Syria and a variety of other issues. I think such consultations are crucial given the very tense situation in the Middle East and North Africa.
Ms Merkel has mentioned that just under a month ago we marked the 70th anniversary of the start of the Great Patriotic War. It is truly a very difficult and sensitive historical date. We laid flowers today. I am grateful to the Federal Chancellor for such careful attention to this date.
We highly value the commemorative events that took place during this period in the Federal Republic of Germany. I believe this will make an invaluable contribution to the strengthening of bilateral relations between our nations.
Perhaps that is all before the start of our meeting. I hope that the ministers will add more details and fill the gaps we have left.

Press statement and answers to questions at a news conference following Russian-German interstate consultations

News conference following Russian-German interstate consultations. With Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Ladies and gentlemen,
As Madam Federal Chancellor very accurately said, these have been two good days for Russian-German cooperation. I was glad to visit Hannover. Incidentally, this city is a landmark for me, too because I first came here as First Deputy Prime Minister. That was when I met Madam Federal Chancellor for the first time and that's when our interaction began.
I believe the results of the 13th round of the interstate consultations speak for themselves. The main part of the news conference took place on the other side of this hall because an unprecedented number of very important documents were signed, very substantial agreements dedicated to our partnership in the sphere of modernisation, bilateral trade and economic cooperation and investment.
Suffice it to say that this year we will most likely reach the pre-crisis level of economic and trade cooperation and reach a peak in the history of our economic ties. Certain industries act as a driving force for our cooperation: I mean energy, transportation engineering, automobile manufacture, building materials and healthcare. We have some good ideas on the development of relations among small and medium-sized businesses.
We had a very productive discussion at the Petersburg Dialogue forum. For the first time the forum was quite informal and highly informative. We talked about everything, from Russian-German economic and energy ties to the rule of law and respect for journalists’ rights. All in all, we discussed the entire range of issues that concern civil society today, and I think that it is in this spirit that this dialogue should be conducted in the future. It became more interesting, and therefore, more meaningful.
”We did not overlook any important subjects. So I think that these consultations were extremely useful and totally frank. ‘
The Year of Russia in Germany and the Year of Germany in Russia lie ahead. I think these will be exciting years in our relations, when a large number of events will be held.
As Ms Merkel just said, we also discussed international cooperation. We talked about ways to overcome the problems created by the situation in Libya. We also talked about Syria and the Middle East, as well as Moldova and Transnistria. We talked about a number of other very complex interstate issues on today's agenda. We discussed the situation in the global economy and finance, the Eurozone and the financial situation in the United States. On the whole, we did not overlook any important subjects. So I think that these consultations were extremely useful and totally frank. Thank you for that.
Question: Mr President, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that it will be necessary to conduct a political and economic purge after the elections. What does this mean in a country that has seen the cases of Natalia Estemirova and Mikhail Khodorkovsky? Could you please tell me what it will look like?
Dmitry Medvedev: If I understand your question correctly, you are asking about the response that Mr Putin gave about the post-election period. I think he said that there is a need for hygiene products after every election campaign because every campaign is accompanied by an injection of various types of information and different technologies, sometimes not very clean ones. I think this was the point of what he said. But he was talking about personal hygiene. In fact, there is nothing to repeat here. He used an expression, quite a graphic one, in my opinion.
In any case, the elections must be open, honest and in accordance with Russian law. As for the use of different election technologies or polling techniques – these things always happen. The question is that this should be within the limits and in compliance with the current Russian legislation.
I have repeatedly spoken about what I am going to do. I suggest a little more patience, for just a short while longer. I will tell you everything, whether I will run for President or find some other work for myself. I hope that is what your question is about, and my answer will ultimately not disappoint you.
”Petersburg Dialogue forum was quite informal and highly informative. We discussed the entire range of issues that concern civil society today, and I think that it is in this spirit that this dialogue should be conducted in the future.“
I did not want to talk about it but I will also say a few words about the Quadriga prize, even though you have not asked me about it. In truth, it is a German headache, not a Russian one. But I think that any public organisation that awards prizes can choose who will receive the prize and who will not, who it likes and who it does not like.
But when a decision is made it must be executed, otherwise it is simply a manifestation of cowardice and inconsistency. And I think that after a certain decision this award has finished, at least for the international community.
Question: Russia and Germany had a distinct opinion on Resolution No. 1973 of the UN Security Council concerning Libya. You gave Russian diplomats instructions to abstain from voting. What is your assessment of how this resolution is being implemented now? You also said you discussed the situation in Syria during your consultations. Do Russia and Germany have more similarities or differences in their positions on this matter?
Dmitry Medvedev: My position on Libya has not changed. I believe that in and of itself, the resolution is not at fault. Both resolutions, No. 1970 and No. 1973, are quite normal, but we voted for the first one and not for the second. Nevertheless, we presumed that the resolution would be fulfilled in accordance with its text. And if it talks about “closing airspace,” that does not mean it is a war. But in truth, instead of simply closing the airspace, an active phase of civil war was begun. At the same time, certain forces are supporting conflicting sides. This is not very good; or, to be more precise, it is exceptionally bad for Libya itself.
Thus, I am sure we must continue searching for opportunities to resolve this situation peacefully, involving any available mediators and any possibilities, because the Libyan problem cannot be resolved by military means. Russia is making its input; my special representative is visiting various nations and I think his work is helpful. We will continue seeking a compromise. I am confident that it is possible to reach a compromise between Benghazi and Tripoli, between the rebels and Gaddafi’s supporters.
As for relations with Gaddafi himself, we hold the same position; it is reflected in the Deauville Declaration, which was issued by the G8.
Concerning Syria. We really wouldn’t want the events in Syria to develop in the same way as in Libya. That is precisely why Russia’s position is very measured. We would not want to see a resolution that is subsequently manipulated, waved around while saying ‘We have a resolution, it says that Assad is bad so we are going to close the sky’, and the closing of the airspace would be followed by military action, or something else. So our position is measured.
Yesterday, in a very productive exchange of views with Angela, we grappled for possible options to send the right signal to President Assad, so that he makes reforms and refrains from the use of force in his country, while simultaneously sending a message to the opposition that they should not just protest, but also propose some constructive ideas. Now it is up to our foreign ministers and other assistants to agree on how to do that.
”New phase of state property sales is underway in Russia, including a whole variety of very attractive assets. And if our German partners are interested, we await German investments in this regard.“
We could also take advantage of Germany’s presidency of the United Nations Security Council.
Question: You said you spoke about the euro zone crisis, so if I may, Mr President, I would like to ask you: German industry is most interested in a partnership involving Russia’s resources, in addition to natural gas and oil. Do you support this initiative, particularly a company supplying rare-earth metals?
Dmitry Medvedev: I will make several comments. With regard to the euro, I am a reserved optimist. First of all, the euro is a young currency, but a very promising one. And although this is the second time Angela and I are discussing the euro situation at a press conference (we also discussed it in Meseberg), I nevertheless believe it’s not a matter of defects in the idea of the euro itself, but rather, an unfavourable set of circumstances that was ultimately tied to the financial and economic crisis, the global financial crisis. But that does not mean nothing needs to be done. I think our partners understand what they must do.
For Russia, it’s not an idle question, since we have trade transactions, as well as significant gold and currency reserves, in euro. Thus, I hope all necessary agreements will be reached, and the nations currently facing difficult situations will exercise the full measure of responsible behaviour.
The key problem is that the euro, a strong and solid currency, is presently serving states with very different economic levels, as we have never seen this in the history of humankind. And the thorny path being taken by the euro as a universal means of payment and settlement shows that such universal currencies can exist. We believe that in the future, we should have an increase in the number of universal reserve currencies.
”I have repeatedly spoken about what I am going to do. I suggest a little more patience, for just a short while longer. I will tell you everything, whether I will run for President or find some other work for myself.“
Thus, I hope our partners will be successful. We count on agreements to be reached, without damaging the interests of any countries, but rather, manifesting a consolidated and responsible position on the part of all states composing the euro zone. We wish our partners success in this, and I personally wish Angela Merkel success.
Question: And the question about industry.
Dmitry Medvedev: The fact is, we are ready to develop a variety of relations with our German friends pertaining to the rare-earth metals sector as well as other projects pertaining to the extraction, processing and use of mineral resources. In this regard, the list of projects can be endlessly broad.
Moreover, I would like to draw everyone’s attention to the fact that a new phase of state property sales is underway in Russia, including a whole variety of very attractive assets. And if our German partners are interested, we will give them the corresponding information. We expect that they will also participate in the respective procedures pertaining to the sale of these assets. So we await German investments in this regard.
Thank you, everyone.

Excerpts from transcript of 11th Petersburg Dialogue Russian-German Public Forum
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Madam Federal Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,
This forum is eleven years old already. I think it was a very successful initiative. What is most important is that it does not become boring and I don’t believe that it has been dissipating in various bureaucratic initiatives year after year but has been growing into an increasingly open venue. It is vital that it remains a laboratory of ideas, ideas that are generated by civil society and which assert themselves with the greatest confidence both in Russia and in Germany.
”This forum is eleven years old already. It is vital that it remains a laboratory of ideas, ideas that are generated by civil society and which assert themselves with the greatest confidence both in Russia and in Germany.“
It is important for us to talk about pressing issues, without fabricating them out of nothing, without inventing them but talking about the subjects we want to discuss. This is a partnership that connects Russia and Germany, a partnership for modernisation, which we conceived some time ago, quite successfully in my opinion, and which we are promoting with our key European partners, especially with Germany.
Obviously, this is not just a partnership between states; it is a partnership between people and between non-governmental organisations. The closer it is, the better. It is very important that this issue has been the subject of your discussion.
This year is the Year of Education, Science and Innovation. It is good that we exchange information about this, because a number of useful new agreements have been signed between universities and various civil society organisations. We expect interesting ideas from you.
We extend the idea of partnership for modernisation to the legal sphere, which, as a lawyer, I give special attention to. It is very important for us to know the opinion of our civil societies on the state of the law. After all, legislation is not just a set of rules recorded on paper; it is also the spirit of the law and its enforcement.
For example, in our country there is a gap between the letter and the spirit of the law, between the way the law is formulated and how it is executed. I do not think that gap is dramatic; on the contrary, I believe we have been shifting the bounds of the law and the enforcement of the law. These problems exist in any state but for us it is a great challenge.
”Partnership for modernisation is not just a partnership between states; it is a partnership between people and between non-governmental organisations. The closer it is, the better.“
I fully agree with what Madam Federal Chancellor said earlier. We must speak frankly about everything, otherwise the conversation becomes less interesting. We must talk openly and honestly about what we feel is right in each other's lives and those things that don’t seem quite right. Such issues exist, and that is the main value of such forums. It is better to argue than to keep silent.
The only thing I would say here today is that Madam Federal Chancellor and I very rarely argue but that does not mean that you should not do so. Perhaps it’s more harmful for us to argue than it is for you, and the future of Russian-German relations depends on how honest we are.
I have been watching with great pleasure and interest the development of the youth debate, the emergence of the German-Russian Youth Parliament. I know that the young parliamentarians approach their work with utmost responsibility, and that is the key to a positive future for our relations.
Next year and in 2013 we will hold the Year of Russia in Germany and the Year of Germany in Russia. This greatly increases the interest to the Petersburg Dialogue forum because it is precisely the kind of venue that should become central during these two years.
Everything we discuss here is highly pertinent to Russian-German cooperation. We've just attended a forum of Russian and German business leaders, where we talked about progress in our business relations. They are developing very dynamically. This year we will most likely reach a record post-crisis level in trade between our economies, our countries.
”All throughout the world, and now in our country as well, nongovernmental organisations are carrying out huge work in a wide variety of areas. And it is imperative to demonstrate the usefulness of that work. Incidentally, the draft law prepared in line with my instructions, which is intended to support socially oriented NGOs – not just morally, but through financial support as well – is aimed precisely toward this goal.“
The economy is a very important component, but it's not everything. We understand the value of humanitarian ties and the importance of direct communication on all issues. I am confident that the Petersburg Dialogue forum will continue to fulfil this mission honourably.
Madam Chancellor and I have once thought about when the time will come for us to preside over this forum and agreed that it would not happen too soon. Angela, we agreed that you and I will not preside at this forum any time soon. (Laughter.)
***
The truth is, we view 95 percent of the world’s problems in absolutely the same way. I suppose there are peculiarities that make us somewhat different, but that’s a good thing because otherwise, we would find one another very boring. Still, we are like-minded on most positions. And it is very important for us to visit one another regularly, and moreover, to have tens, hundreds of thousands of people doing it every year. That is precisely the goal for the next two years.
***
I cannot refrain from saying a couple words about visas and procedures, because this is usually a matter that truly, directly depends on the authorities. I would like to comment briefly. The Russian Federation is ready to work on the visa issue with the European Union and Germany just as quickly as our partners would be willing to do it. If they want to take several years, then it will take several years; if they want half a year, very well, let’s do everything in six months. In other words, in this regard, we will not delay anything. We are ready to progress as quickly as possible: both for businesses and for everyone who wishes to visit our countries.
As far as our residence registration procedures are concerned, we will strive to make them as liberal as possible for everyone who enters Russia legally. In this sense, we will also be taking measures to simplify administrative registration. There should be no doubts on this matter.
We must certainly move toward ensuring mutual recognition of diplomas.
Russia is currently a participant of the Bologna Process. Our higher education and graduate-level studies are already changing together with other states that are participating in this process.
”I believe the future lies in new technologies. And the media outlets that do not go online are unlikely to survive. In fact, the same thing is happening throughout the world.“
But we are maintaining two tracks in education. We have an education track that falls within the framework of a so-called specialist degree – in other words, the traditional, classical education for the Russian Federation. We also have a track within the framework of the Bologna Process, with Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees. So in the future, we absolutely need to agree on how we will equate these diplomas, simply because two different tracks are being maintained.
***
Our legislation on nongovernmental organisations is not ideal, although in my view, it has clearly improved, because during a certain period, we were really going overboard and truly making NGOs completely accountable for all entirely insignificant issues. Now, we have taken a step in the right direction, but that does not mean that this legislation is optimal; it is to be improved further.
Overall, this is our big problem with accountability in general. Everyone reports on everything; they do it regularly and in an absolutely pointless way, because the majority of these reports are subsequently thrown in the wastebasket. Nonetheless, everyone scribbles on and writes about a variety of matters. This is not just a problem with NGOs, but with many other types of entities as well, so reducing the bureaucratic barrage of accountability and transitioning to electronic paperflow formats would be absolutely the right idea.
Now, the second issue: the very spirit of relations with nongovernmental organisations. Here, I also agree 100 percent: there is distrust. But I will say frankly that in my view, the distrust did not emerge eight or ten years ago, it has existed historically, because during Soviet times, people were suspicious of any type of proactive work by public groups or average people. ‘Why are they being active? There are official organisations for that’, people would say. This attitude remains. And so, it is imperative for all of us to eliminate these vestigial attitudes from our consciousness. I mean everyone, from upper-level authorities and down to the village and rural authorities. Because that is our heritage.
Still, progress should be made not just on the part of the government, but by NGO representatives as well, who must show what they are capable of. After all, the average citizen often thinks an NGO is just a group of people who say that the government is bad but doesn’t actually do anything. Yet the truth is, all throughout the world, and now in our country as well, nongovernmental organisations are carrying out huge work in a wide variety of areas. And it is imperative to demonstrate the usefulness of that work. Incidentally, the draft law prepared in line with my instructions, which is intended to support socially oriented NGOs – not just morally, but through financial support as well – is aimed precisely toward this goal.
If we follow that path, then the legislation and enforcement of the law will be entirely normal.
***
We have many media outlets, and they vary in their state of being. Indeed, it’s not very good that the government provides financial support to certain media outlets, particularly small provincial ones. It’s good for their survival, but it’s not very good intrinsically. It would be much better if they were self-sufficient financially, but for the time being, that is not the case, so if the government stops supporting them, then they will most likely close down.
But at the same time, this causes a certain problem. For example, in small towns, if media outlets receive money from regional authorities, they begin to serve those authorities’ interests and turn into mouthpieces for specific individuals which is not good at all.
”The Russian Federation is ready to work on the visa issue with the European Union just as quickly as our partners would be willing to do it. We are ready to progress as quickly as possible: both for businesses and for everyone who wishes to visit our countries. As far as our residence registration procedures are concerned, we will strive to make them as liberal as possible for everyone who enters Russia legally.“
So the sooner we can separate these kinds of media outlets from the state authorities, the better. Incidentally, I spoke about this in my Address to the Federal Assembly.
Now, I’ll comment on how they can keep operating. I believe the future lies in new technologies. And the media outlets that do not go online are unlikely to survive. In fact, the same thing is happening throughout the world – in Germany and in Europe as a whole. So their ability to change is very important.
And finally, the last thing you asked about – the question concerning public television. Public television is a good thing. Indeed, Germany’s experience, or that of other nations, could be followed. But at the same time, we must determine the principles for how public television would operate in our country. If it were based on collecting taxes from nearly every citizen, that could cause certain problems. Or, we would need to find another source of financing. And in my view, that is where the main problem lies.
If we create a public television mechanism, we must clearly respond to the question: what funds will be used to develop this television? If it’s not just a private channel (in that case, everything would be clear; it would belong to a particular group of companies), but rather, public television, then what is the source of its existence, in order for it to be separated from both the state and from commercial enterprises, while expressing civil society’s consolidated position? This is the main setback for which, as far as I understand, we have still not come up with any solution.
Hence in this regard, if our colleagues – my colleagues who are working on this – were to prepare such a framework, it would be my pleasure to assess it. The main question is how this kind of public television would work – taking into account the German experience as well, of course.
