President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
As usual, we will discuss current matters related to domestic and international security, as well as developments around the world, beyond our borders.
However, I would like to begin with preparations for the parade marking the Victory in the Great Patriotic War. We have discussed a number of possible modalities for holding this celebration.
I can see that Mr Lavrov has already informed his colleagues on how we will work with our foreign partners. But my first question will be for Mr Shoigu.
Mr Shoigu, how have the Defence Ministry and the detachments that will take part in the parade approached preparations, and how are the Victory Parade rehearsals progressing?
Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, we launched these preparations on June 2, strictly in keeping with the plan and your instructions. These preparations are proceeding in full compliance with the time plan.
In view of the persisting threats related to the fact that many people find themselves concentrated in the same place, we have prepared separate accommodation facilities for everyone, with regular, daily decontamination and sanitation. Moreover, all the participants were tested and underwent all the necessary medical procedures before joining the preparations.
In addition to this, medical brigades carry out daily testing and examine every single person in every accommodation unit for service personnel taking part in the parade.
We had three rehearsals already. Mr President, this year I believe there will be a lot of machinery, and quite a few new models, new weaponry that have already entered service or are about to be transferred to the army. This relates to aircraft, ground-based weaponry and missile defence systems. All these are at the storage facilities, on full combat alert. Some 30 T-34 tanks will roll through Red Square for the first time since the parade that included actual Great Patriotic War combat machines. These tanks embody our Victory.
There will be 75 aircraft. We have selected and examined their crews, and training sessions continue. This applies to long-range and strategic aircraft, attack bombers, fighter jets, and of course helicopters. All these aircraft are actual combat machines, not just some kind of special aircraft that were sitting there and waiting for their moment to come. We took them from combat divisions. The same applies to most of the crews, with the only exception being our air display teams that are staffed with pilot school students.
Everything will be definitely ready for the parade, Mr President.
End of report. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
We will continue discussing preparations for the parade in the future. Thank you for your report.
Mr Lavrov, the pandemic has understandably changed the way we prepare for these celebrations, including our contacts, and how we work with our foreign friends, colleagues and partners.
What is the situation today? Since, of course, we need to make sure that we guarantee absolute safety for our guests, what is going on in this regard?
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov: Mr President, we confirmed with all those who were invited to the parade initially scheduled to take place on May 9 that our invitation still stands. We have already received confirmations from 12 heads of state, most of them from the CIS.
