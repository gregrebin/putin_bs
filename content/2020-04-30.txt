President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon.
Welcome to all. Let us get down to work.
This week, during a meeting with heads of regions, I instructed the Government to develop a national action plan to normalise business life and restore the economy, employment and people’s incomes.
Let me stress, we must not just stablise the situation. We know the world is changing. The crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic is affecting key markets and the system of cooperation ties.
Companies, including Russian companies, are searching for and quickly adopting completely new business models based on digital and other advanced solutions. The importance of scientific and technological development is growing dramatically; and many countries that have such potential are developing it.
Let me repeat that, when planning a long-term strategy, we must consider all these factors and this new reality.
In addition, I have asked the Government to draft another package of urgent support measures for people and the economy. I am referring to decisions that must come into force very soon.
Colleagues, you know that the situation that people and companies daily face is complicated and requires new steps, actions and prompt response.
Relevant specific proposals are being drafted. I know that the Government, the Presidential Executive Office and all of us will work on this. Today let us discuss these in more detail.
But before we get started, I would like to say, or to be more precise, repeat the following.
It is important to not simply adopt the decisions that are being proposed. They must be implemented with tangible results for the people, business and the economy. This is the basis, the essence of all our work.
In this context, I would like to ask you to prepare and present detailed reports on the implementation of the extraordinary measures that we adopted in March and April, including the following specific decisions. I will remind you of them.
First, the organization of additional federal compensation to doctors, paramedics, nurses, junior medical personnel, and ambulance crews that are directly working with coronavirus patients. These decisions have been adopted. The main point now is when exactly they will receive the money.
Second, what about the special insurance for the specialists that are now helping these patients, risking their lives and health? We agreed on introducing a system similar to the insurance system for Armed Forces personnel. Has the necessary documentation been prepared?
Third, what about the additional monthly payments of 5,000 rubles for a child up to 3 years old to families that are entitled to maternity capital? Let me remind you that these payments are due for April, May and June.
Fourth, those who lost their jobs after March 1 will receive the highest unemployment benefit of 12,130 rubles, in April, May and June. Families with children where the parents are currently unemployed will be issued an additional payment of 3,000 rubles per underage child a month. I would like you to report on the implementation of these measures and whether this aid is perceptible for the people.
Fifth, it has been decided that low-income families will receive payments per each child aged between three and seven not from July 1 as planned, but from June 1. Moreover, the income of a given family will be calculated based on the current situation. I expect you to provide detailed information on whether these payments can be made strictly on time.
Sixth, starting on May 18, small and medium-sized companies in the affected industries that have preserved their personnel must receive financial assistance to pay April and May salaries to their staff. The payments will amount to one minimum wage per employee. Please report on the streamlining of this support mechanism and whether it is clear and convenient for the businesses.
I expect you to report on these and other matters by May 6. I would like to remind everyone that by May 5 the Government and Rospotrebnadzor, working together with the working group of the State Council, are to submit their recommendations on the gradual easing of the self-isolation rules after the May holidays.
Together, these reports and recommendations will be used to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken and to determine the further steps to be carried out by the federal and regional authorities.
Now let us get back to discussing the decisions we are to implement in the near future. Let us hear our colleagues from the Government.

Conversation with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Vladimir Putin had a conversation, via videoconference, with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.

Vladimir Putin had a conversation, via videoconference, with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, Mr Mishustin.
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
: Good evening.
Mr President, I have just found out that I tested positive for the coronavirus. As such, according to the requirements of Rospotrebnadzor, I must self-isolate and follow doctors’ orders. I must do this to protect my colleagues.
The Government will continue to operate as normal. I plan to keep up regularly with my colleagues by telephone, and by videoconference with you, Mr President, on all major issues. I suggest appointing Andrei Belousov
as Acting Prime Minister.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Mishustin, what is happening to you now could happen to anyone. I say this all the time.
You are a very industrious person and I would like to thank you for all you have done up to now. Obviously, Government members and colleagues from the Presidential Executive Office are at high risk because despite all the restrictions on interpersonal contact, it is impossible to adopt decisions without working directly with others, with one’s colleagues. Of course, this comes as no surprise.
But I would like to say that I hope you will be in good enough shape to work and remain actively involved in formulating the decisions that we discussed at today’s meeting on extending support to people, the economy in general and its individual industries, especially those that have been hit hardest recently by the coronavirus pandemic. You will not just take part in formulating these decisions. I want to tell you that the final decisions will not be adopted without your participation.
I would like to wish you the speediest recovery possible. Get well soon.
Mikhail Mishustin: Thank you, Mr President.
In the current circumstances, I would like to once again ask all citizens of our country to take the coronavirus and its spread as seriously as possible.
The May holidays are ahead, and I ask all of you to stay at home and observe all necessary restrictions. I am sure that together we will be able to defeat this virus and return to normal life. The Government is taking and will take all necessary steps for this.
I ask you all to remember that today, the date when the country can return to normal life depends on the discipline and willpower of each of us.
Take care of yourselves and your loved ones.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Mishustin, your proposal regarding the nomination of Mr Belousov for the position of Acting Prime Minister of the Russian Federation is accepted. Today I will sign the corresponding Executive Order.
Get well as soon as possible.
Mikhail Mishustin: Thank you for your support and kind words.
Vladimir Putin: When you arrive at the hospital, please call me. I will be awaiting your call. Talk to you later.
Mikhail Mishustin: All right. Take care.
Vladimir Putin: Take care.
