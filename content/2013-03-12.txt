Meeting with Presidential Aide Elvira Nabiullina and Central Bank Chairman Sergei Ignatyev.
Sergei Ignatyev
's term in office will expire on June 23, 2012 but in accordance with the law, the President must make the nomination to the State Duma of the new head of the Central Bank not later than three months before that date, that is, by March 23, 2012.
Elvira Nabiullina
suggested that if her candidacy for the post of Central Bank chairperson is approved, she will appoint Sergei Ignatyev her adviser.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Mr Ignatiev, the time is approaching when you will have to leave the post of Chairman of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Before talking about the future, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for these years of working together.
Central Bank Chairman Sergei Ignatiev: Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: These past years of joint efforts have been both interesting and useful.
But that is not the most important thing. It is a fact that during the years when you were Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, the financial system in our country has changed and strengthened significantly. This was largely due to your professionalism and perseverance.
I would also like to note that the most difficult and dangerous period for our economy – the financial and then the global economic crisis – passed with relatively small losses in our country, and that was in part due to your efforts. I am particularly grateful to you for this. I am sure that your hard work in this post will be marked with a state decoration. Thank you very much.
As for your successor, and I already informed you about it, I intend to nominate Elvira Nabiullina for the post of Chairperson of the Central Bank of Russia. The reason for this decision is that, as all of us and the experts know well, the Central Bank is not just a bank, at least it is not a commercial bank, but primarily a regulator of the financial system and a major institution of state macroeconomic policy.
Elvira Nabiullina served as the Minister of Economic Development for a long time, she headed the relevant ministry, and now heads the economic bloc in the Presidential Executive Office, and I intend to submit her candidacy to the State Duma for approval. I hope that Ms Nabiullina accepts this proposal.
Presidential Aide Elvira Nabiullina: Mr President, first of all I want to thank you for the trust you are showing by proposing my candidacy. I understand how responsible, demanding and professional this work is, and would like to ask (if the State Duma endorses my candidacy) Mr Ignatiev to stay on at the Central Bank as adviser to the Chairperson.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Ignatiev, I join Ms Nabiullina in this request and hope that you will accept this proposal.
Sergei Ignatiev: Thank you, I agree.

Meeting with President of Abkhazia Alexander Ankvab
Vladimir Putin and Alexander Ankvab discussed prospects for developing cooperation between Russia and Abkhazia.
March 12, 2013
21:00
Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region
Meeting with President of Abkhazia Alexander Ankvab.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Ankvab, friends, colleagues, I am happy to see you in Moscow.
We will soon be marking the fifth anniversary since the establishment of diplomatic relations, so we can draw some conclusions about how Abkhazia is regaining its economic footing and how problems are being resolved – you have more of them than you would like, but I suppose that is true everywhere.
Nevertheless, they need to be resolved, regardless of how difficult they may seem at first glance. I very much hope that today, during these consultations, we will be able to draw some conclusions and examine the challenges we could jointly resolve in the near future.
President of Abkhazia Alexander Ankvab
: Thank you, Mr President. Thank you for the opportunity to once again visit Moscow. We were looking forward to this meeting.
I fully agree with you: this August will mark a very important date for us, the fifth anniversary of our independence, of our recognition by Russia. We are preparing for it and we want to approach this date with even better results in our post-war development – I am referring to the fulfilment of a major agreement between us.
We have already done a great deal, and today, we discussed a wide range of issues with my colleagues that will contribute to further improvement of the situation in Abkhazia. I want to express our citizens’ warmest wishes to you; they remember and value your attitude toward Abkhazia. This is very important for our development. Thank you.

Meeting with President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan
The two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation issues.
March 12, 2013
17:00
Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region
With President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan.
Vladimir Putin congratulated Serzh Sargsyan
on his victory in the presidential election, which was held in Armenia on February 18. The working visit to Russia is the first foreign visit of the Armenian President since the election.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sargsyan, thank you very much for your visit. This is your first foreign visit, your first trip abroad since the presidential election in Armenia. I want to congratulate you again on a convincing victory: you gained over 60% of the vote, which is an excellent result. It shows the Armenian people’s confidence in you and gives you the opportunity to meet all the objectives you set for yourself when you embarked on the election campaign.
Russia has special relations with Armenia, and people in both countries are aware of that. Overall our relations are developing successfully, despite the problems in the global economy. Last year trade between our states grew by over 20%. I am also very pleased to note that Russia continues to steadily hold first place among Armenia’s trade and economic partners.
Russia is also in first place in terms of accumulated foreign investment (over $3 billion) in Armenia, and this trend continues. We have ambitious major long-term joint investment plans. I hope that today we will have the opportunity to talk about the entire range of issues.
Our political contacts are developing equally actively. We are cooperating at all levels and in all areas: there are contacts among our parliaments, our Governments, political parties and public organisations. All this provides a very good basis for strengthening our relations, especially interpersonal contacts and ties in the humanitarian sphere.
A very important role is played in this area by the public associations of the Armenian diaspora in the Russian Federation. There are many Armenians living in Russia, as you know, and they are very respectable and hard working citizens of our country. They continue to maintain close contacts with their historical homeland. This is the additional human capital that unites us.
I am very glad to see you. Welcome.
President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan: Thank you, Mr Putin.
Thank you for the invitation and for your congratulations on my election as President of Armenia.
It is absolutely natural that my first visit abroad is to Moscow, to Russia. Russia is our strategic partner and ally, and that says it all.
Last year was a special year for us. We celebrated the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our states. During this period, we have seen very positive development and achieved exceptional results in all fields: in politics, the economy, defence, the humanitarian sphere and integration. Therefore, we believe the potential we have accumulated is good and now we must develop it further.
Mr President, I want to thank you especially for the progress in the defence sphere since our last meeting. The Russian Defence Minister and Chief of the General Staff have visited Armenia. The Armenian public very much appreciated the fact that the Russian Defence Minister came to Armenia on the Day of Armenian Armed Forces.
I agree with you that there has been some solid progress in the economy. Certain issues remain, but we hope for Russia’s help and support.
I am very happy to be here and thank you for your kind words. Once again, Mr President, I confirm my invitation to you to come to Armenia on a state visit. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
