discussed the ministry’s work, in particular, the development of pre-school education, the construction of new schools and the renovation of old ones.
She also talked about the All-Russian Olympiad, which had a total of six million participants, with most of them competing in the field of mathematics. Russia’s participation in international Olympiads has yielded a total of 38 medals, including 22 gold ones.
The Minister paid special attention to the importance of early occupational guidance. In 2018, over one million people were admitted to specialised secondary education institutions. The success of Russian participants in WorldSkills and Euroskills competitions has played a major role in these results. This year, the WorldSkills competition will be held in Kazan, Russia.
The Minister also spoke about the Abilympics professional contest for children with disabilities, which results in employment contracts for participants.
Russia is now working to create a total of 100 priority development centres to provide further training for teachers, Olga Vasilyeva explained, as well as a total of 340 IT-CUBE centres. Each region will have its own quantoriums and local Sirius centres, which will be provided with special programmes developed by the Sirius federal centre.
The President drew the Minister’s attention to the necessity of monitoring teachers’ wages in order to prevent them from dropping below the regional average.
