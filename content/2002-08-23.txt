Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
Just a couple of words about the meeting with the leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
We have agreed that I will brief you on the results of our work.
As announced, we primarily discussed bilateral relations.
We focused on cooperation in the economic sphere. We discussed in some detail all the issues connected with the possible linking of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Trans-Korean Railway. Let me repeat, we discussed it in full detail with all the possible scenarios.
We discussed other areas of cooperation and a number of projects that may be of mutual economic interest. Of course we paid attention to some political issues, including the most relevant problems in international life. I briefed the Korean leader about the Russian position on key international issues.
For his part, my colleague filled me in on the state of the inter-Korean dialogue. I would like to stress again that the Russian Federation is ready to continue to do all it can to bring about a settlement on the Korean Peninsula.
My colleague has reacted positively to our efforts. We very much hope that all the parties involved in this process will continue to develop the dialogue. There are some positive signs. In any case, the good will of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is there.
Thank you.
