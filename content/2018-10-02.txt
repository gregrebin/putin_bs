Beginning of the meeting with permanent members of the Security Council
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, colleagues.
Before we take up the main issue we wanted to discuss today, I would ask the Defence Minister to report on progress in carrying out my instructions on Syria. Mr Shoigu, please.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, colleagues,
In accordance with the President’s decision, we have started taking a series of measures to enhance the air defence systems of the Syrian Arab Republic, primarily to safeguard our service personnel.
We have completed the delivery of S-300 systems. It includes 49 units of equipment, illuminating laser radars, major emitter location systems, command vehicles and four launchers. The work was completed a day ago. We have completed the delivery of the full system to Syria.
Apart from that, we have significantly strengthened and activated the electronic warfare system, and added extra equipment to it. As a result, as of today we control the close zone of up to 50 kilometres and the remote zone, where sorties on Syrian territory mainly originate from, we control 200 kilometres of that.
As to the unified command system of the overall air defence network, we have also begun equipment deliveries. We will complete the work together with training and readying the crews and forming a single network by October 20.
Vladimir Putin: How long will it take to train the crews of the Syrian army to operate the S-300?
Sergei Shoigu: Three months.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Sergei Shoigu: Also, the necessary personnel and specialists have been selected and started training.
Vladimir Putin: Fine, thank you.

Meeting with President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
It is a pleasure to have you here in Moscow.
I remember well your previous visit on May 8–9. Most recently, we celebrated the 180th anniversary of diplomatic relations.
I note with satisfaction a steady increase in bilateral trade, namely, 23 percent last year and another 13.3 percent in the first half of this year. Russia’s investment in the Serbian economy is also growing and now stands at $4 billion.
I know we will need to talk about the situation in the region as well.
I am very pleased to see you. Welcome.
President of the Republic of Serbia Alexandar Vucic (speaks Russian): Mr President, my friend,
First of all, thank you very much for your kind words and hospitality. It is, as always, a great honour for me.
Meeting with President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic.
However, today's meeting is of great importance for my country, Serbia.
I am pleased with the way our relations are unfolding, which is the result of our open, constructive and productive discussions. Russian-Serbian international relations are very good.
I must express my deep gratitude to you personally, Mr President, for your firm position in upholding international law and vital national and state interests of the Republic of Serbia.
As you are well aware, the situation in the Western Balkans is very complicated, and as a state Serbia is faced with numerous daily provocations. Despite this, regardless of our willingness to reach a compromise and to maintain peace and stability, we are still very far from reaching any decision on the matter concerning Kosovo and Metohija.
I would like to emphasise once again that as an independent and free state Serbia will maintain military neutrality, and I believe that Serbia is the only country in the Western Balkans that enjoys such a definition today.
With regard to our economic ties, you were right when you said that our trade is on the rise. I am quite pleased with this and I hope that we can improve our economic relations in the future.
At the meeting with President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic.
In closing, I would like to thank you once again for everything you are doing for Serbia and to take this opportunity to invite you to visit Belgrade in the near future. This, as I said earlier, will be a great honour for us and our people.
I have prepared for you a book My Fair Serbia written by Russian authors.
Many thanks again for your very warm welcome and hospitality.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
