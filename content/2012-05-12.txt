President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Tibilov.
I am very pleased to see you. I know that this is your first trip to Russia since you were elected president. I would like to congratulate you again on this occasion.
We are all aware of the events preceding your election. I very much hope that the situation will improve. The republic has a great number of economic and social problems. Russia’s help was at hand, as in the most difficult moments of South Ossetia’s modern history. We will continue to support South Ossetia in the peacetime, when there is great need to accelerate economic and social recovery.
Today we will have an opportunity to discuss all of these issues in detail. I am very glad to see you.
President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov: Thank you, Mr Putin.
”Russia’s help was at hand, as in the most difficult moments of South Ossetia’s modern history. We will continue to support South Ossetia in the peacetime, when there is great need to accelerate economic and social recovery.“
First of all, on behalf of our nation and myself, I would like to congratulate you on taking office as President of the Russian Federation.
I want to note that Russian presidential election was held at high level in South Ossetia. More than 92% of the people who participated in the election voted for you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Leonid Tibilov: I am pleased to note this. This suggests that the people of South Ossetia have great respect for you and associate with your name a bright future, progress, development and the evolution of our republic.
At present the people of South Ossetia are studying with great interest and enthusiasm the Executive Order of the Russian President of May 7, which states that the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia are states that require an element of security and must develop like other recognised states. We thank you for this attitude to our people. We know that your efforts have been focused on gaining the recognition of South Ossetia, on the formation of our state, and our people follow your progress closely.
Once again, I greet you on behalf of our people. Please accept my congratulations and best wishes. Thank you for everything you are doing and everything the great Russia is doing for South Ossetia. As for us, we will remain committed to the historical principle that our people have chosen: with Russia forever. We will continue along this path.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
