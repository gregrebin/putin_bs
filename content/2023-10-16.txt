President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
We will discuss two issues.
First, we will discuss the situation in the special military operation zone. I would like to ask Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to brief us on current developments there.
Second, we will focus on the situation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone and the situation in Gaza. I have already had several conversations with regional colleagues, and several other conversations are to take place before the day is over.
So, let’s get to work.
Mr Shoigu, you have the floor, please.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, colleagues,
Current developments in the special military operation zone are marked by various attempts by the enemy to launch offensive actions on different fronts. They have run into our defence units on almost all fronts. Notably, we have managed to improve our tactical positions in many sections of the front. In fact, the enemy has been unable to make any significant advances.
The Ukrainian authorities had planned a spring offensive campaign, followed by a summer and now an autumn campaign, but they have not achieved any notable success in any of them. On the sections along the frontline where we observe heightened enemy activity today, we have built deep layered defences, which we can now refer to as active defence because since the beginning of the summer campaign on June 4, the enemy has suffered substantial – or at least major – losses in terms of personnel and equipment, including hundreds of tanks, over 1,000, almost 1,500 armoured vehicles, and they continue to incur such losses.
We maintain active operations on the fronts where we deem it necessary to improve our position.
Overall, the situation appears stable and secure. The troops are acting professionally and displaying heroism on many fronts. They are confident that they will not only hold their positions, but also continue to implement the plans we have outlined.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Mr Ryabkov, I value the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, special services, foreign intelligence, and all of our colleagues here.
Considering the unfolding developments and the presence of many Russian citizens in the conflict zone on both sides, along with the suffering of the civilian population, there is a pressing need for providing humanitarian assistance to everyone in the region.
So, in the run-up to the telephone calls and in order to formulate a common position on this matter, I would appreciate it if you could begin by providing a general assessment of the Foreign Ministry’s perspective on the situation. After that, we can discuss the first and second issues in more detail.
Mr Ryabkov, please go ahead.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov: Thank you.
Mr President, colleagues,
In our assessment, the situation in the Middle East conflict zone is tending to get worse. The operations undertaken by the Israeli military are indiscriminate. There remains the looming threat of a ground operation encompassing an incursion into Gaza. This enclave and its residents are now facing a humanitarian crisis. They are not receiving medical assistance and their essential needs are not being met, which is causing substantial concern around the world.
The Russian Federation is doing its best politically, as you just mentioned, particularly through the UN Security Council, where we have put forward a draft resolution focusing on humanitarian matters. The United States, which holds the primary responsibility for this dramatic and severe crisis since it has sought to monopolise the settlement process for many years now and to disregard the relevant Security Council resolutions, is now obstructing efforts to achieve a proper solution.
Diplomatic efforts on various fronts are intensifying. In principle, the risk of this conflict spiralling out of control is substantial. We will spare no effort in collaboration with our partners and political allies to curb the ongoing developments and to establish conditions that ensure the safe evacuation of our citizens from harm’s way. Efforts to this end are being carried out through our embassies and our mission in the Palestinian National Authority, as well as through our consular services. Our Crisis Management Centre remains in touch with all relevant agencies at all times.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Ok. Thank you very much.
