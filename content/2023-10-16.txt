President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
We will discuss two issues.
First, we will discuss the situation in the special military operation zone. I would like to ask Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to brief us on current developments there.
Second, we will focus on the situation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone and the situation in Gaza. I have already had several conversations with regional colleagues, and several other conversations are to take place before the day is over.
So, let’s get to work.
Mr Shoigu, you have the floor, please.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, colleagues,
Current developments in the special military operation zone are marked by various attempts by the enemy to launch offensive actions on different fronts. They have run into our defence units on almost all fronts. Notably, we have managed to improve our tactical positions in many sections of the front. In fact, the enemy has been unable to make any significant advances.
The Ukrainian authorities had planned a spring offensive campaign, followed by a summer and now an autumn campaign, but they have not achieved any notable success in any of them. On the sections along the frontline where we observe heightened enemy activity today, we have built deep layered defences, which we can now refer to as active defence because since the beginning of the summer campaign on June 4, the enemy has suffered substantial – or at least major – losses in terms of personnel and equipment, including hundreds of tanks, over 1,000, almost 1,500 armoured vehicles, and they continue to incur such losses.
We maintain active operations on the fronts where we deem it necessary to improve our position.
Overall, the situation appears stable and secure. The troops are acting professionally and displaying heroism on many fronts. They are confident that they will not only hold their positions, but also continue to implement the plans we have outlined.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
Mr Ryabkov, I value the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, special services, foreign intelligence, and all of our colleagues here.
Considering the unfolding developments and the presence of many Russian citizens in the conflict zone on both sides, along with the suffering of the civilian population, there is a pressing need for providing humanitarian assistance to everyone in the region.
So, in the run-up to the telephone calls and in order to formulate a common position on this matter, I would appreciate it if you could begin by providing a general assessment of the Foreign Ministry’s perspective on the situation. After that, we can discuss the first and second issues in more detail.
Mr Ryabkov, please go ahead.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov: Thank you.
Mr President, colleagues,
In our assessment, the situation in the Middle East conflict zone is tending to get worse. The operations undertaken by the Israeli military are indiscriminate. There remains the looming threat of a ground operation encompassing an incursion into Gaza. This enclave and its residents are now facing a humanitarian crisis. They are not receiving medical assistance and their essential needs are not being met, which is causing substantial concern around the world.
The Russian Federation is doing its best politically, as you just mentioned, particularly through the UN Security Council, where we have put forward a draft resolution focusing on humanitarian matters. The United States, which holds the primary responsibility for this dramatic and severe crisis since it has sought to monopolise the settlement process for many years now and to disregard the relevant Security Council resolutions, is now obstructing efforts to achieve a proper solution.
Diplomatic efforts on various fronts are intensifying. In principle, the risk of this conflict spiralling out of control is substantial. We will spare no effort in collaboration with our partners and political allies to curb the ongoing developments and to establish conditions that ensure the safe evacuation of our citizens from harm’s way. Efforts to this end are being carried out through our embassies and our mission in the Palestinian National Authority, as well as through our consular services. Our Crisis Management Centre remains in touch with all relevant agencies at all times.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Ok. Thank you very much.

Opening new road facililies in the regions (via videoconference).
The first stage in the construction of a bridge over the Svir River in Podporozhye, the Leningrad Region, has been completed ahead of schedule. The structure plays an important role for local residents and the neighbouring region, the Republic of Karelia, handling continuous freight transit towards St Petersburg.
Sections of the R-217 Caucasus Highway have been widened from two to four lanes in Daghestan. This will reduce accident rates and expand the route’s capacity. The 274-kilometre Caucasus Highway links Vladikavkaz with Grozny and Makhachkala and reaches the border with Azerbaijan.
A system of transport interchanges that has been built on the M-4 Don Motorway near Gelendzhik will make it possible to reduce traffic congestion in the city and to speed up traffic on tourist routes.
A bridge over the Kalmius River, facilitating vehicle and tram traffic between the Central and Levoberezhny (Left Bank) districts of Mariupol, has been overhauled.
A 40-km section of the R-242 Perm-Yekaterinburg road, part of the M-12 Vostok (East) Motorway, has been repaired ahead of schedule in the Sverdlovsk Region. Work on this project was carried out 24/7.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Khusnullin, colleagues, friends,
Yesterday, Russia marked Road Workers’ Day. I congratulate the sector’s veterans and current employees, including designers, engineers, builders and ordinary workers, on their professional holiday. I would like to thank you for your dedication, for accomplishing various objectives, and I wish you and all your families and friends good health and every success.
Public road system is one of the most important sectors of the domestic economy, and it is very important that road builders confidently implement their plans and ensure a high pace of development of roads, including motorways that are part of the backbone network of roads and international transport corridors.
In 2022, it became possible to achieve earlier targets and to upgrade 50 percent of regional roads in accordance with pre-set standards. Since early 2023, road construction projects have been proceeding at a lively pace. We have already built and resurfaced over 10,000 km of roads, including over 2,000 km of federal roads and over 8,000 km of regional and local roads.
Overall, more than 31,000 kilometres of roads will be built, reconstructed or repaired in 2023. We just talked about this with Mr Khusnullin; in 2022, it was 29,000 kilometres, and this year it will be around 31,000 kilometres. The pace is very good. By the end of the next year, the sector should reach a new important threshold – to bring up to set standards 85 percent of highways in the country’s major agglomerations.
Today, we are putting several road facilities into operation. Thus, the bridge in Mariupol has undergone a major overhaul, which will help restore transit between the city’s districts. But it is especially important that this project will reduce traffic congestions on the Novorossiya federal highway towards Crimea and improve the peninsula’s transport accessibility.
Today, we are also opening the upgraded sections of the Caucasus motorway in Daghestan. This road connects Vladikavkaz with Grozny and Makhachkala and runs to the border of the Republic of Azerbaijan. We will continue to implement projects to modernise this road and build bypass roads around Makhachkala, Khasavyurt, Derbent and other communities to provide for the development of the strategically important North-South transport corridor. I recently discussed this issue with the President of Azerbaijan. It is important for our partners to complete these facilities because they are also working on large projects in this area.
The renovation of a section of the Perm-Yekaterinburg motorway has also been completed. The road is part of the Vostok transport corridor that connects Moscow with Kazan and Yekaterinburg. The development of this and other transport corridors will remain our priority.
Also, new interchanges on the Don motorway near Gelendzhik have been built. They will ease the traffic load on the city, make traffic on tourist routes faster and improve the environmental situation.
The first stage of the construction of a pedestrian overpass in Podporozhye, the Leningrad Region, has been completed ahead of schedule. The implementation of this project will improve the connectivity of the communities in this region.
I want to thank everyone who took part in the construction of these important facilities, and also your partners and suppliers who delivered construction materials and equipment.
We will definitely continue to create modern, fast and safer transport networks and prioritise the development of the most important transport corridors. I know that all of our plans related to road construction will be implemented.
I once again thank everyone who was part of the construction of these transport facilities that we are opening today and I wish all of you success.
Let’s move on to reports about what has been done and how the work went. I would very much like to hear about it.
