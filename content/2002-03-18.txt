Vladimir Putin: As you know, I visited Odessa on March 17 and met with the Presidents of Ukraine and Moldova. As I see it, our colleagues have made a very important political and economic decision concerning expanded integration on post-Soviet territory. They have decided to examine the issue of integration with the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC), which now comprises Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Belarus. I believe that this is a very important and rational decision showing that our relations are developing in the right direction. I would like the Government to actively discuss the entire range of issues in this sphere.
