President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon,
We are here to discuss establishing a parliamentary centre. This is something we have been discussing for a while, but given the recent decisions to extend Moscow’s city boundaries (which will happen on July 1 this year), it makes sense now to start discussing the actual specifics of the issue: what we need to do, the scale and amounts involved, and the kind of premises we need for the State Duma and the Federation Council and their staff in order to have good conditions for effective work. They ended up in their current premises, after all, more by chance really, in the aftermath of the events of the early 1990s, and these premises were not designed for the work of our country’s highest legislative bodies.
Our parliament deserves better, as the body that passes the main laws that shape our country’s life. We need a set of premises of a reasonable scale, in which the parliament will go about its work. We will also need administrative and management buildings and probably some kind of accommodation for staff, as well as other functional solutions essential for parliamentary needs. I look at this issue within the context of the decision to transfer state bodies from central Moscow to the new city, that is, to the districts that will be incorporated within the city’s expanded boundaries as from the middle of this year.
Let’s start work.
