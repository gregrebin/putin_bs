President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon, friends,
Good afternoon. We are delighted to see you all in Moscow.
This year we marked 30 years since the signing of our basic document, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. That treaty became effective in November 1993.
Our relations are developing progressively and have reached a very high level. Suffice it to say that Russia is the main trade and economic partner: Russia accounts for 23 percent, or more precisely, 22.9 percent, of Tajikistan’s trade and holds a leading place in terms of foreign direct investment, which is worth US$1.6 billion.

The intergovernmental commission is working very effectively. I believe that it will hold a regular meeting in Moscow next month. I would like to point out – I have already mentioned our mutual trade – that imports from Tajikistan, primarily the imports of agricultural products, have grown considerably, by 67 percent. It is a very good indicator.
Our cultural ties are developing dynamically, and I would like to say in this connection that on September 1, 2022, you and I took part [via videoconference] in the opening ceremony of five schools with Russian as a subject and as the language of instruction. This year and in the next few years, the Russian Government will allocate 200 million rubles a year to buy textbooks for these schools. I know that there is a shortage of them, but this decision will help.
There are also Tajik students and post-graduate students at our universities. Tajikistan has the largest quota in the CIS: 900 people. We will increase it to 1,000 for the 2024–2025 academic year.
President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
: Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: It is I who should thank you, knowing how much time you devote to the development of the Russian language and our relations in culture and the humanitarian area in general. We have many agreements: at one time, you initiated the creation of a centre for educating talented children in Tajikistan and establishing the Russian Drama Theatre named after Mayakovsky. The Government of the Russian Federation is allocating four and 3.5 billion rubles for these purposes, respectively. So, these plans will be carried out.
Of course, a component linked with ensuring security in the region is very important and we will certainly talk about it, primarily in the context of Afghanistan, especially on the eve of the CSTO meeting in Minsk. You are more sensitive to and clear about everything happening in this area. So, this part will be very important. We are also working thoroughly in other international associations. We are always in contact with each other and are coordinating our positions.
We are very happy to see you. Welcome again!
Emomali Rahmon: Mr Putin,
I am glad to meet with you again. Thank you for the warm reception. I am very pleased to be in Moscow. We have missed it.
We favour the continuation of our active interstate dialogue. Our trade and economic relations are on the rise. Our humanitarian cooperation is at the top level. Security issues occupy a special place in our bilateral agenda.
Today, I would like to discuss with you the status of and prospects for our interaction, as well as international and regional issues. I have already emphasised – and I believe we will continue this discussion during the talks – that there are many good things to do in the economy and other areas.
I would like to cordially thank you again for the invitation and a hospitable reception.
Vladimir Putin: Now we will talk here in the restricted format and later in the expanded format. In the evening, we will have an opportunity to talk face to face at an informal dinner. So we have a big programme ahead,
Emomali Rahmon: Thank you.

Speech by the President of Russia
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Ramaphosa, colleagues, friends,
We think the initiative of the President of South Africa, as the current chair of BRICS
, to convene an extraordinary summit to discuss the escalation in the Gaza Strip, has come at the right time.
The thousands of deaths and mass expulsion of civilians, the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the area are causing deep concern. Just now, one of our colleagues spoke of the deaths of a large number of children. It is terrible, but when you watch children being operated on without anaesthesia, it certainly evokes intense feelings. And all of that is, in fact, happening as a consequence of the United States’ aspiration to monopolise the mediation role in the Palestinian-Israeli settlement process and block the activities of the Middle East Quartet of international mediators.
This is history’s way of demonstrating that attempts to single-handedly cut the “Palestinian knot” are unviable and counterproductive. Because of the sabotage of UN decisions, which clearly called for the establishment and peaceful coexistence of two independent and sovereign states – Israel and Palestine – more than one generation of Palestinians has grown up in an atmosphere of injustice, and Israelis cannot fully guarantee the security of their state either.
Russia's stance is consistent and independent of momentary conditions. We urge the international community to join efforts aimed at de-escalating the situation, negotiating a ceasefire and achieving a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The BRICS states and the countries in the region could play a key role in this work.
For this reason, it is particularly significant that our colleagues from Middle Eastern countries, which received invitations to become full members of the BRICS this year, are joining our meeting today. I would like to take this opportunity to respectfully acknowledge their efforts to normalise the situation. In particular, I am referring to the Peace Summit hosted by Egypt and the joint Arab-Islamic extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia.
It is worth noting that all BRICS countries have similar positions on the need to collectively reach long-term and durable settlement of the long-standing Palestinian-Israeli problem.
This was reflected during voting on the draft resolution on a humanitarian truce in the UN General Assembly and in discussing a UN Security Council resolution on the Middle East settlement process, which was adopted for the first time in the past seven years. Although this resolution contains merely an appeal for humanitarian pauses rather than a full ceasefire, we consider the very fact of its approval a step in the right direction.
I would like to emphasise that such humanitarian pauses and, better still, a full ceasefire are essential to continue the efforts to free hostages and evacuate civilians and foreigners from the Gaza Strip. I must express again my deep gratitude to President [of Egypt Abdel Fattah] el-Sisi, and all our Egyptian colleagues for their help in resolving many challenging issues linked with receiving and sending home the Russian citizens that had left the conflict area.
Of course, by all accounts, the most urgent goal is to reach a truly long-term and sustainable truce. I agree with my Brazilian colleague that it is important that other states not get drawn into a war in the Middle East and that the conflict not spread in any way, as is preserving the fragile peace between religions.
In this context, we consider it extremely useful to continue discussing subsequent developments in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in BRICS. If there are no objections, colleagues, we will initiate possible contacts, including via videoconference, concerning these issues during Russia’s upcoming BRICS presidency next year.
In general, the new format of emergency online summit meetings suggested by President [of South Africa Cyril] Ramaphosa appears to be quite promising. Importantly, this applies not only to the Middle East settlement but to other urgent global and regional issues.
Thank you for your attention.
