President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
Once again, I wish you a warm welcome to Moscow, our capital.
We congratulate you sincerely on your election to the high office of President of the People’s Republic of China. We thank you for deciding to make our country the destination of your first visit abroad. This clearly shows the great importance that we place on building the relations between our countries.
We have done much over the last years to develop our relations in all different areas. Russian-Chinese relations are now a very important factor in global politics. Our bilateral trade is growing and so are the direct contacts between our regions. We are carrying out major projects in the humanitarian and cultural spheres too, and all of this is in the interests of people in both countries. 
It is a great pleasure to welcome our Chinese friends to Russia. Mr President, we are sure that your visit will give a powerful new boost to developing the ties between us.
President of The People’S Republic of China Xi Jinping
(re-translated): President Putin,
Thank very much for your warm invitation. As you know, the first country I am visiting in my capacity as President of China is Russia, and you are the first foreign head of state with whom I am meeting. 
I remember very well when I first came to Russia three years ago at your invitation. That visit left me with the warmest and deepest impressions. Last June, we met again in Beijing. 
We have also exchanged letters and recently spoke by telephone. I have the impression that we are always completely open with each other. We are able to get on well together and always find it easy to talk. We are good friends.
Mr President, I agree with your assessment of the state of our bilateral relations. Our countries are indeed partners engaged in comprehensive strategic cooperation.
Relations between China and Russia are better now than ever before in our history. Our countries share many common fields of interest. It is in our state interests in both countries, and in the interests of our peoples, to keep developing our relations.
The main aim of my current visit is to join efforts with you to keep developing our comprehensive relations and strategic cooperation.
Today’s meeting will give us the chance to hold a substantial exchange of views on various aspects of bilateral cooperation and also on current international and regional issues of mutual interest.
I have a very substantial programme over these two days that will produce big results for the good of both nations and for the good of our relations.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues and friends,
My friend, Mr Xi Jinping, and I have just had a constructive discussion of the main issues on our bilateral agenda, going over all the different areas, and have examined international issues too. 
Now, at this expanded-format meeting, we will discuss in detail the situation and prospects for developing our cooperation in various specific areas.
I ask Mr Xi to make a few opening remarks, and then we will give the floor to our colleagues.
President of The People’S Republic of China Xi Jinping
(re-translated): Mr President,
Once again, I thank you very much for your invitation and for the warm reception we have been given.
Russia is the first country I am visiting as President of China, and you are the first foreign head of state with whom I am meeting in this capacity. This clearly demonstrates the high level and special nature of our bilateral relations. 
Today’s meeting is an important link in this respect and I am sure that it will do much to continue our relations’ stable and healthy development.
Over these last 20 years, we have gone from freeing our ties from Cold-War stereotypes and establishing a new kind of relationship between our two leading countries in the 1990s, to gradually forming a new comprehensive strategic partnership over the first decade of this century. 
We now have solid and mature political relations between our countries. Today, our ties have entered a new stage. Our countries offer each other important development opportunities and are key cooperation partners. 
The next stage in developing our comprehensive strategic partnership and cooperation should focus on further strengthening our reciprocal political support, decisively supporting each other’s efforts to protect state sovereignty, security and development interests, doing all we can to build up our practical cooperation, turning the advantages our high level of political relations gives us into real practical cooperation results, and bolstering our coordination on resolving international and regional issues so as to guarantee our common strategic security. 
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I agree fully with the President of China’s assessment of our relations.
To keep up the pace we have gathered over these last years, we must concentrate our efforts on the most important areas, one of which is developing our economic ties – an area of direct interest to our peoples and their needs.
Our bilateral trade is now close to $90 billion and continues to grow. I want to give the floor now to the Economic Development Minister, Mr Belousov, to begin the discussion, and then will ask Mr Xi to give the floor to his Chinese colleague.

Press statements following Russian-Chinese talks
March 22, 2013
19:00
Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping made press statements following the talks.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, ladies and gentlemen,
We have just concluded substantial talks with the President of China and the high-level delegation of our Chinese friends accompanying him on this visit.
This is Mr Xi Jinping’s first visit abroad since taking office as President of the People’s Republic of China. My acquaintance with him goes back a long time now and we have built up good and friendly relations over these years. But this is the first time that Mr Xi is visiting Russia as President of China, and it is his first foreign visit in this capacity. We greatly value this symbolic gesture which unquestionably reflects the special strategic nature of our relations.
Our two countries’ multi-faceted cooperation is in our peoples’ fundamental interests and is a conscious historic choice. We agreed today to do everything we can to continue developing our trade and economic cooperation, humanitarian and other ties. We will continue our close coordination on regional and international issues. Our commitment to common goals and our similar positions on many issues are reflected in the Moscow Joint Declaration and the Action Plan for Implementing the Agreement on Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation.
Our talks today focused specifically on trade and economic cooperation. Both countries want to encourage reciprocal investment. We agreed to make more active use of the possibilities the Russian-Chinese Investment Fund offers, and to pay particular attention to infrastructure and production projects in the Russian Federation’s Far East.
We have also agreed to continue our close cooperation in high-tech fields such as outer space exploration, information technology, aircraft manufacturing, and energy, including nuclear energy.
The large number of joint projects gives us confidence that we will soon bring our bilateral trade up to the $100-billion mark, and in the not too distant future will see it reach $150 billion.
We discussed promising joint regional action in areas such as water resource use, shipping, and environmental protection, and on issues such as combating illegal migration and ensuring reciprocal travel for our citizens.
Big projects in culture, health and other humanitarian areas have done much to deepen our humanitarian cooperation. We are in the middle of another project now – the reciprocal tourism years.
The Year of Russian Tourism in China was a success and we saw a substantial increase in the number of tourists. Today, the Year of Chinese Tourism in the Russian Federation will hold its opening events.
The President of China proposed holding reciprocal youth exchange years in 2014 and 2015, and this initiative will certainly be supported. We will do everything we can to ensure that our young people can have free contacts with each other, discuss joint projects, and organise joint initiatives for the future.
Back in 2010, Xi Jinping and I discussed the idea of organising an exhibition on the Chinese Communist Party’s VI congress, which took place in Russia in 1928. We have now agreed to open a permanent exhibition at the site.
Of course, we also discussed current regional and international issues, above all those on which we coordinate our action in the UN, the UN Security Council, the BRICS group, and the G20. We discussed the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, and possible developments in Afghanistan.
In conclusion, I want to thank our Chinese friends once again for this open and useful dialogue.
The Chinese delegation headed by the President of China will continue its work in Russia tomorrow, but I can already say now with full assurance that Mr Xi’s state visit to our country is going well.
This visit will certainly produce positive long-term results, will have a good effect on relations between our countries and peoples, and will strengthen our partnership’s strategic nature.
Thank you for your attention.
President of The People’S Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): Good evening, friends and media representatives,
I am very pleased that I was able to meet with my good, long-standing friend President Putin today in Moscow.
Three years ago, I visited Russia and saw it with my own eyes. Now, back in Russia three years later, I am seeing new, positive developments in this country.
Your nation firmly maintains its socio-political stability and your economy is advancing rapidly; Russia is playing an ever-greater role in international affairs. We in China are genuinely happy for Russia’s successes, development and progress.
Immediately after becoming President of China, I am making a state visit to Russia in order to continue our positive tradition: our nations’ heads of state always visit the other nation on their first visit abroad. This demonstrates the high level and particular nature of all-around partnership and strategic cooperation in Chinese-Russian relations.
President Putin and I had constructive, substantive talks in a trust-based, well-wishing and business-like atmosphere. During the talks, we discussed issues of a bilateral nature, as well as all the important international and regional issues that are of mutual interest to us. Based on the outcomes of the talks, we reached agreements on a wide spectrum of issues.
Together, we determined vectors and key areas for further developing Chinese-Russian relations, as well as our cooperation at the next stage. Based on the overall situation and our long-term prospects, we decided that we will continue considering the development of our relations as a priority direction in our countries’ foreign policy.
We will firmly and decisively support the efforts of the other side to defend its national sovereignty, security, and development interests, emphatically back the other side’s aspiration to follow its path in accordance with the real conditions of their nation, and encourage the other nation’s work toward development and revitalisation.
We share the view that developing large-scale economic cooperation between our countries is dictated by the need to jointly overcome the international financial and economic crisis, as well as the promotion of economic development in our countries. Today, all the conditions are ripe for this large-scale cooperation.
In this respect, the two sides will fully tap into their cumulative potential, the advantages of our economies, and work as hard as possible to strengthen our economic power, as well as our international competitiveness.
I know that our friends in the media have a great deal of interest toward Chinese-Russian cooperation in energy. On the eve of my visit to Russia, the two sides already essentially reached breakthrough agreements on additional oil supplies, pipeline construction and the import of Russian liquefied natural gas.
Thus, President Putin and I confirmed these agreements and gave instructions for our government agencies and corporations to begin implementing these agreements accordingly.
At the same time, I want to stress a very important issue: Chinese-Russian cooperation in energy is manifold, comprehensive and full-fledged. In our cooperation, we always meet each other half-way with the goal of achieving reciprocal advantage and mutual benefit.
China and Russia have similar or identical positions on key international and regional issues. And in this respect, we have broad common interests. We decided that in the future, we must continue strengthening our coordination and reciprocity further to resolve the key issues. We are determined to assert the goals and principles of the UN Charter, as well as the universally recognised principles of international relations, in order to defend justice and equality in the world, to assure peace, stability and prosperity on the planet.
Naturally, I also want to express my sincere and deep gratitude to President Putin for his warm invitation, as well as his cordial welcome, and to thank all the Russian colleagues from the Russian Government for their extensive work in receiving our delegation.
Today, as President Putin said, was the first day of my visit to Russia. I can state that this day was a great success. This allows us to affirm that we did not come to Russia in vain; this visit is progressing very successfully. Tomorrow, we will continue this work, but I can already tell you now that my visit will certainly end in success.
Friends and members of the media, I would like to thank you very much for your efforts in covering my visit. In the future, I will visit Russia frequently, and President Putin will also visit us often. I think that we will meet many more times.
In conclusion, I would like to wish all of you good health, happiness and success.
Thank you.

Interview to the ITAR-TASS news agency
March 22, 2013
00:00
Question: BRICS' relatively new phenomenon attracts increased global attention due to the optimistic predictions about its development, especially against the backdrop of global crisis developments in the world economy. What is BRICS' immediate and long-term significance for Russia? Is such a format practical for the development of relations among these countries?
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: There are a number of long-term factors working on BRICS
' success. For the last two decades the economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa have been in the lead of global economic growth. Thus, in 2012, the average GDP growth rate in the group amounted to 4%, while for the G7 this index was estimated at 0.7%. In addition, GDP of the BRICS countries derived from the national currency purchasing power parity is currently over 27% of the global GDP and its share continues to increase.
BRICS is a key element of the emerging multipolar world. The Group of Five has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the fundamental principles of the international law and contributed to strengthening the United Nations central role. Our countries do not accept power politics or violation of other countries' sovereignty. We share approaches to the pressing international issues, including the Syrian crisis, the situation around Iran, and Middle East settlement.

Concept of participation of the Russian Federation in BRICS
March 21, 2013
The BRICS’ credibility and influence in the world is translated into its growing contribution to the efforts to stimulate global development. This important matter will be specifically addressed at the BRICS Leaders – Africa Dialogue Forum to be held on the sidelines of the Durban summit.
BRICS members advocate the creation of a more balanced and just system of global economic relations. The emerging markets are interested in long-term sustainable economic growth worldwide and reforms of the financial and economic architecture to make it more efficient. This is reflected in last year's joint decision to contribute $75 billion to the IMF lending programme, thus increasing the participation of the fastest growing economies in the Fund's authorised capital.
Russia, as the initiator of the BRICS format and chair at its first summit in Yekaterinburg in 2009, sees the work within this group among its foreign policy priorities. This year, I have approved the Concept of the Russian Federation's Participation in the BRICS group, which sets forth strategic goals we seek to achieve through interaction with our partners from Brazil, China, India and South Africa.
Such cooperation in international affairs, trade, capital exchange and humanitarian sphere facilitates the creation of the most favourable environment for further growth of Russian economy, improvement of its investment climate, quality of life and well-being of our citizens. Our membership in this association helps foster privileged bilateral relations with the BRICS nations based on the principles of good neighbourliness and mutually beneficial cooperation. We believe it crucial to increase Russia's linguistic, cultural and information presence in the BRICS member nations, as well as expand educational exchanges and personal contact.
Question: What are the group’s short-term objectives and how do you see strategic directions for BRICS' economic development?
”BRICS is a key element of the emerging multipolar world. The Group of Five has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the fundamental principles of the international law and contributed to strengthening the United Nations central role. Our countries do not accept power politics or violation of other countries' sovereignty.“
Vladimir Putin: BRICS identifies what is to be done based on action plans adopted at the group's annual summits. Last year's Delhi Action Plan outlined 17 areas of cooperation, including meetings of Foreign Ministers on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, joint meetings of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on the sidelines of the G20, World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, as well as contacts between other agencies.
We are currently negotiating a new plan we will discuss at the meeting in Durban. I am confident that it will help us develop a closer partnership. We expect that we will be able to closer coordinate our approaches to key issues on the agenda of the forthcoming G20 summit in St Petersburg, increase our cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking and production, and our efforts to counter terrorist, criminal and military threats in cyberspace.
It is of great importance for Russia to increase its trade and investment cooperation with its BRICS partners and launch new multilateral business projects involving our nations’ business communities. In Durban we intend to announce the formal establishment of the BRICS Business Council designed to support that activity. The summit will be preceded by the BRICS Business Forum, which will bring together more than 900 business community representatives from our countries.
Question: The potential of the BRICS economies brings up not only the question of economic policy coordination but also that of close geopolitical interaction. What is BRICS' geopolitical role and mission in today's world? Does it go beyond the purely economic agenda and should the BRICS countries accept greater responsibility for geopolitical processes? What is their policy with regard to the rest of the world, including its major actors such as the United States, the European Union, Japan… What future do you see for this association in this regard?
Vladimir Putin: First and foremost, the BRICS countries seek to help the world economy achieve stable and self-sustaining growth and reform the international financial and economic architecture. Our major task is to find ways to accelerate global development, encourage flows of capital in real economy and increase employment. This is particularly important in the context of poor global economic growth rates and unacceptably high unemployment. Although this is mainly true of western countries, the BRICS states are also negatively affected; export markets are shrinking, global finance lacks stability, and our own economic growth is slowing down.
At the same time, we invite our partners to gradually transform BRICS from a dialogue forum that coordinates approaches to a limited number of issues into a full-scale strategic cooperation mechanism that will allow us to look for solutions to key issues of global politics together.
The BRICS countries traditionally voice similar approaches to the settlement of all international conflicts through political and diplomatic means. For the Durban summit, we are working on a joint declaration setting forth our fundamental approaches to pressing international issues, i.e. crisis in Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East.
We do not view BRICS as a geopolitical competitor to western countries or their organisations — on the contrary, we are open to discussion with any country or organisation that is willing to do so within the framework of the common multipolar world order.
Question: Russia and China are important strategic and historic partners. How do you see the significance of such partnership not only for the development of the two countries, but also for the entire system of international relations and the world economy?
Vladimir Putin: Russia and China are two influential members of the international community, they are permanent members of the UN Security Council, and they are among the world’s largest economies. That is why the strategic partnership between us is of great importance on both a bilateral and global scale.
Today the Russian-Chinese relations are on the rise, they are the best in their centuries-long history. They are characterised by a high degree of mutual trust, respect for each other's interests, support in vital issues, they are a true partnership and are genuinely comprehensive.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping
is currently on a state visit to Russia. The fact that the new Chinese leader makes his first foreign trip to our country confirms the special nature of strategic partnership between Russia and China.
In the last five years only, the volume of bilateral trade has more than doubled. China has firmly taken the first place among our trading partners. In 2012 the Russian-Chinese trade turnover increased by 5.2% to constitute $87.5 billion (in 2007 the figure was $40 billion).
The commonality of our approaches to fundamental issues of world order and key international problems has become an important stabilising factor in world politics. Within the framework of the UN, the Group of Twenty, BRICS, the SCO
, APEC and other multilateral formats, we are working together, helping to shape a new, more just world order, ensure peace and security, defend basic principles of international law. That is our common contribution to strengthening sustainable global development.
”BRICS members advocate the creation of a more balanced and just system of global economic relations. The emerging markets are interested in long-term sustainable economic growth worldwide and reforms of the financial and economic architecture to make it more efficient.“
Russia and China show an example of a balanced and pragmatic approach to solving the most critical issues, such as the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, situation around Iran’s nuclear program.
Question: Before the BRICS summit your schedule features a working visit to South Africa. What do you expect from the upcoming negotiations with South African party? Will this visit give impetus to the development of bilateral relations?
Vladimir Putin: Russia and South Africa have old ties of friendship and mutual respect. Multifaceted cooperation is developing between our countries, with constructive political dialogue established at the highest level, between governments, ministries and agencies. Interparliamentary, interregional, business and humanitarian contacts are consistently expanding.
During the visit to South Africa we certainly hope to give new impetus to our bilateral relations. The adoption of the Declaration on Strategic Partnership between Russia and South Africa is being prepared; it will confirm the new quality of our relations, determine key areas of joint work in the future. We plan to sign a number of important intergovernmental and interagency documents in Durban: the declaration on strategic partnership, the agreements on cooperation in the energy sector, agriculture, etc.
Trade and economic cooperation will be in the focus of our attention during negotiations. Last year the volume of trade between Russia and South Africa grew by 66% and reached $964 million (in 2011 the figure was $580 million). Big Russian businesses, including such companies as Renova, Norilsk Nickel, Evraz Group, Basic Element, Severstal, Renaissance Capital and Vnesheconombank are actively entering the South African market, they are interested in further expanding their presence in South Africa.
Russia and South Africa can significantly, by many times, increase the volume of bilateral trade and investments, the number of mutually beneficial projects in the mining sector, power industry (including nuclear power), space exploration, military and technical sphere.
We consider it important to develop cooperation in the field of education and culture by strengthening direct ties between universities, promoting Russian language teaching in South African educational institutions, organising film festivals and tours by leading artists, and exchanging museum exhibitions.
We will discuss practical steps to achieve these goals with President Jacob Zuma

Opening of Year of Chinese Tourism in Russia

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping
, ladies and gentlemen, friends,
We are truly pleased to welcome our Chinese friends to Moscow, Russia’s capital. Exactly three years ago, my friend Mr Xi Jinping and I opened the Year of Chinese Language in Russia in this same palace, and today, we are officially launching the Year of Chinese Tourism in Russia.
In recent years, Russian-Chinese ties have taken on the characteristics of an all-encompassing and truly strategic partnership. Humanitarian ties hold a special place in this context: they bring our peoples closer together, strengthen trust between them, and form a broad civil and societal foundation for interstate relations. We successfully implemented large-scale projects such as the national Years of Russia and China, the Years of Russian and Chinese Language; we have held hundreds of bright, memorable events that garnered positive responses from the peoples of our countries. Many of these joint initiatives have taken on a permanent format. Student festivals, competitions for the best knowledge of the Chinese and Russian languages, forums for university rectors, national cinema weeks, and youth athletic events have become regular occurrences.
Let me stress that the Year of Russian Tourism in China was held quite successfully. The number of Russian tourists visiting China grew by almost fifty percent, and Chinese guests were the second largest national group of foreign visitors to Russia. Germany is currently in first place, but if we compare the populations of Germany and China, it is clear that we have great potential in our tourist exchanges with China. I am confident that the popularity of our country among Chinese people will continue to grow.
For Russian tourists, China is also among the most appealing destinations. China’s history spans many centuries and the nation has a very rich culture and philosophy. It has unique monuments, an exquisite cuisine and ancient healing arts. At the same time, China has rapidly-developing tourist and resort centres meeting the most modern demands. In 2012, 1.3 million Russian tourists visited China. China became the third most popular country visited by our people. Here, too, we have great potential for growth.
There is no doubt that events for the Year of Chinese Tourism will be colourful and interesting, broadening the geographic scope of mutual tourist visits and promoting greater knowledge between our citizens about one another, as well as strengthening our special strategic relations.
Thank you.
