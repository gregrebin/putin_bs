Video address on Rescue Worker’s Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades,
I want to congratulate the Russian Emergencies Ministry’s current and former staff on your professional holiday, Rescue Worker’s Day.
The work in all services and departments of the Emergencies Ministry is fraught with a heavy workload and often with great risk.
Emergencies Ministry experts brave the elements, eliminate the aftermath of industrial accidents and fight fires with great skills, determination and courage. They are ready to do their duty in the most challenging and dangerous situations, and promptly come to the rescue of those in need.
These are the best traditions of your ministry. Young employees should rely on these traditions and look up to the response unit veterans.
It is necessary to constantly improve professional skills, reach perfect coordination, and efficiently use the most up-to-date equipment and digital technology, including for preventing emergency situations.
I know that serious, system-wide work is underway in all these crucial, key areas. I want to ask you to continue focusing on it.
I want to commend and thank the Emergencies Ministry staff for their significant contribution to ensuring the safety of people in the new Russian regions – the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. Their efforts include the delivery of humanitarian aid, participation in mine-clearing, and conducting emergency recovery work. People’s appreciation, respect and trust are invaluable and will always be the most unbiased, supreme assessment of the quality of your work and the foundation of the Emergencies Ministry public image.
Comrades,
Today, the ministry and each of you are facing many concrete, practical tasks that are important for the state and all our citizens. I am sure that you will tackle them efficiently and competently, and if necessary, you will act selflessly and bravely and will always be worthy of this noble mission – rescuing people.
I wish you and your families every success, health and all the best.
Once again, I congratulate you on Rescue Worker’s Day. And, of course, I wish you a happy New Year.
