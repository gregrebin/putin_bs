Excerpts from President Vladimir Putin’s News Conference Summarising a Meeting with Regional Governors from the Southern Federal District

Question: What conclusions did you make after today’s discussion on the problems of refugee migration?
Vladimir Putin: This is a very acute problem in Russia. We can only regret that, as we must acknowledge, the state does not yet have a well-articulated and purposeful migration policy. I think it was important for department heads to hear the regional governors’ opinion. As we have agreed, at least the fundamentals of such a state policy will be urgently drafted and presented to the Government and the public.
I have to say that it was very hard to do so until quite recently because Russia was unique for not having a state border, or at least a partof its state border. That is why it was so hard to channel migrants to the regions that needed workers the most. But that has to be done. Now that Russia has withdrawn from the Bishkek agreements, we have such an opportunity. We must take advantage of this opportunity as best we can. That matters most.

Question: What is your opinion of the election situation in the United States? How will Russia arrange its relations with the new US Administration?
Vladimir Putin: The United States is among our principal partners in many fields. As I have said, we are acquainted in detail with the programmes of both candidates—George W. Bush and Albert Gore. Both the Democratic and the Republican candidate’s programmes present their view on developing contacts with Russia explicitly and precisely. Such an approach satisfies us. We respect the American people’s choice, and we will cooperate with any Administration. As for the final conclusions and for congratulating the winner, I think it is worthwhile to wait for the American officials to make their decision. As you know, Alexander Veshnyakov, Chairman of the Russian Central Election Commission, is now there. If need be, he will advise his American colleagues on what to do about it.

Excerpts from the Opening Remarks at the Meeting with North Caucasus Public Activists
November 8, 2000
00:01
Rostov-on-Don
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
The region you live in is very interesting and complex. I would say that it seems to follow the pattern of Russia as a whole. If you remember, the Russian Constitution begins with the words “We, the multi-national people of the Russian Federation.” These words have been very carefully selected to describe who we are – a multi-national but united people.
The North Caucasus is a multi-ethnic region reflecting, like a droplet of water, the situation in the country, only on a smaller scale. This area has more refugees, the so-called displaced persons, both legal and illegal migrants than anywhere else in Russia.
Generally speaking, I don’t even think those migrants can be labeled “illegal” because people cannot be blamed for what happened to this country ten years ago. They used to live in a single country, and they never asked to be separated by all sorts of borders. It is not their fault that they ended up outside the area which they had considered their homeland.
Therefore, we must make a wise decision here in managing this resource, this great potential. We have a better chance to do it than any other country because those people who wish to live here adapt more easily to the local environment than those who wish to live in other places and regions with different cultures.
Adaptation is a very complicated process for migrants. It often takes them a long time to adjust to the local cultural environment. We do not have this problem here because people who come to Russia, many of them highly qualified professionals, are well-educated and ready to work.

Thanks for your attention.
