Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President,
I am very pleased that we have regular contacts with the Serbian leadership, including at the highest level. I had the pleasure of speaking with the Prime Minister just recently at the International Economic Forum in St Petersburg.
I would like to say that we are happy overall with the way our intergovernmental relations are developing. Our bilateral trade has now reached a figure of $2.5 billion. We have good prospects not only in the energy sector but also in industrial production. Of course, I expect that we will also take the opportunity of this meeting today to discuss problems in the region, including the Kosovo issue.
Boris Tadic: Mr President,
I am very grateful for this chance to meet again and to discuss our bilateral relations, our economic relations, and the future status of Kosovo, which are all matters of paramount importance for our country and for the entire region.
I greatly appreciate Russia’s principled position and your personal position on the issue of Kosovo, and I think that any talk of independence for Kosovo is very dangerous for stability in the region in general and for Europe as a whole.
Serbia does not agree with the idea of an independent Kosovo, but Serbia is willing to look for a compromise solution based on respect for international law and on a positive and open dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina to the benefit of stability in the region as a whole.
Mr President,
Our economic relations are of great importance for the entire region’s development. I fully agree with you that we can discuss our cooperation in the energy, transport, and industrial production sectors. It is very important to me that we remain committed to the principles we agreed on at our first meeting. Our relations are firmly set on an upward course.
I am genuinely pleased that we have this chance to meet once again.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
You know our position on the Kosovo issue. I just had the opportunity to meet on the sidelines of this summit with our colleague, the President of Albania, and discuss this matter with him. Our position and all of our efforts are aimed at creating the conditions for stability in this region based on international law and consideration of the interests of all sides.
This position is not based on religious, ethnic or historical motives. It is based on the principles of international law today and on a wish to look to the future and establish stable relations that will enable all countries to develop.
