Beginning of Meeting with President of Serbia Boris Tadic
June 24, 2007
13:00
Zagreb, Croatia
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President,
I am very pleased that we have regular contacts with the Serbian leadership, including at the highest level. I had the pleasure of speaking with the Prime Minister just recently at the International Economic Forum in St Petersburg.
I would like to say that we are happy overall with the way our intergovernmental relations are developing. Our bilateral trade has now reached a figure of $2.5 billion. We have good prospects not only in the energy sector but also in industrial production. Of course, I expect that we will also take the opportunity of this meeting today to discuss problems in the region, including the Kosovo issue.
Boris Tadic: Mr President,
I am very grateful for this chance to meet again and to discuss our bilateral relations, our economic relations, and the future status of Kosovo, which are all matters of paramount importance for our country and for the entire region.
I greatly appreciate Russia’s principled position and your personal position on the issue of Kosovo, and I think that any talk of independence for Kosovo is very dangerous for stability in the region in general and for Europe as a whole.
Serbia does not agree with the idea of an independent Kosovo, but Serbia is willing to look for a compromise solution based on respect for international law and on a positive and open dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina to the benefit of stability in the region as a whole.
Mr President,
Our economic relations are of great importance for the entire region’s development. I fully agree with you that we can discuss our cooperation in the energy, transport, and industrial production sectors. It is very important to me that we remain committed to the principles we agreed on at our first meeting. Our relations are firmly set on an upward course.
I am genuinely pleased that we have this chance to meet once again.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
You know our position on the Kosovo issue. I just had the opportunity to meet on the sidelines of this summit with our colleague, the President of Albania, and discuss this matter with him. Our position and all of our efforts are aimed at creating the conditions for stability in this region based on international law and consideration of the interests of all sides.
This position is not based on religious, ethnic or historical motives. It is based on the principles of international law today and on a wish to look to the future and establish stable relations that will enable all countries to develop.

Beginning of Meeting with President of Bulgaria Georgi Prvanov
June 24, 2007
12:40
Zagreb, Croatia
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President,
I would like once again to offer my sincere greetings and say how pleased I am to have this chance to meet with you once more.
Our relations are developing well and very steadily in all areas of cooperation. Bilateral trade is growing: Russia is now in strong second place among Bulgaria’s trade partners, and this also covers work together in investment, infrastructure projects and, of course, the energy sector.
We are happy with the way work on the Burgas-Alexandropoulis project is progressing. All the countries involved – Bulgaria, Russia and Greece – have ratified the relevant documents. Now we need to take the next step and establish the necessary companies. We also have other major infrastructure projects to examine and I hope that we will have the chance to discuss all of these matters today.
Georgi Prvanov: Mr President, I am very pleased that this forum has given us the chance to meet.
I share your positive assessment of our dialogue and our relations over these last years. What is most important is that this dialogue is helping us to expand our cooperation in all different areas, especially in the economy.
As is tradition when we meet, I would like to begin with a few words about our spiritual and historical heritage. This year marks 130 years since the beginning of the Russian-Turkish war of liberation. In Bulgaria, we are preparing for large-scale celebrations to mark this event. I am sure that all of our institutions will cooperate well in this work and that we will mark these celebrations together.
We are sure that a good political climate encourages trade, economic progress and investment. In this respect, I consider many of the Russian investment projects in Bulgaria to be successful.
But first of all, I would like to note the good relations our countries have in the energy sector. Over the last few months we have accomplished what we were unable to do for long years on the Burgas-Alexandropoulis project. We are very pleased with the work our ministries and agencies involved in this matter have done to achieve these results.

Statement following Meeting with President of Bulgaria Georgi Prvanov
June 24, 2007
12:50
Zagreb, Croatia
President Vladimir Putin: Mr President,
I am pleased that we have discussed not only the implementation of the projects we have already reached agreement on, but also examined major new joint investment projects, including the one discussed in Rome yesterday, which we have given the name Southern Stream. This is the project to build a new gas pipeline system from Russia to Bulgaria and onwards to the other European Union countries.
This project would undoubtedly raise Bulgaria’s role and importance as a major gas transit and distribution centre in Europe and would certainly help to raise energy stability and diversify energy supplies for European countries. This would have a positive impact on the international energy market.
Georgi Prvanov: Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy with our talks, which have covered a wide range of economic cooperation issues.
We discussed in detail the possibilities offered by the new Southern Stream project. This represents an important step not only in energy diversification but also in ensuring the stability of the region and of the European Union in general.
Bulgaria is interested in this project and we are ready to take part. The relevant agencies and institutions will soon discuss the project and make the right decision. We can say with confidence that this project opens up big opportunities for Bulgaria as a whole and for developing our economy. As this meeting is taking place on the sidelines of the Balkan energy summit, I would like to note too that the project would benefit all of the countries present at this summit.
Vladimir Putin: I would like to add that our Italian colleagues have already informed the European Commission leadership about this project. We are thankful to the European Commission for its positive reaction to our plans.

Beginning of Meeting with President of Montenegro Filip Vujanovic
June 24, 2007
12:30
Zagreb, Croatia
President Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very happy to see you.
Our relations have entered a new stage in their development since Montenegro obtained independence. This applies to our political contacts and to our economic cooperation.
Our trade and economic ties are still at a modest level, but we are pleased to see that Russian investment is increasing. We know about our big companies’ plans and we hope that they will benefit from the favourable conditions your government has put in place and that economic actors have thus far enjoyed. We note the favourable attitude the government of Montenegro shows towards Russian companies’ investment activity, and we thank you for this.
Filip Vujanovic: Mr President,
I would like to thank you for this meeting and for your position of principle on matters in our region.
Russia’s position, and your position as President of Russia, was of great assistance in holding a democratic referendum giving our citizens the chance to express their will freely. We would also like to thank Russia for its swift recognition of independent Montenegro and for rapidly establishing diplomatic relations and appointing an ambassador.
I think that the good political relations we have already established at this point will gain new substance through economic cooperation. The creation of the Intergovernmental Committee on Trade and Economic and Scientific Cooperation will make a valuable contribution to this work.
This committee, co-chaired by Minister Shoigu for Russia and by Minister Rodcin for Montenegro, has now held its first meeting and outlined an action plan.
