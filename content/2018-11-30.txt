President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to see you.
We meet often, and this is a great pleasure. Recently our Minister Lavrov
was in your country and gave me a detailed account of his meeting with his colleague.
But first, let me thank you for your event, I would like to congratulate you on the event in Paris marking 100 years since the end of World War I.
Our relations are progressing – trade was up 16.5 percent last year, and the rate is similar this year.
I am very happy to see you.
President of France Emmanuel Macron (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. I would also like to thank you for the November 11 visit to Paris on that occasion as it enhances and strengthens the relations between our two nations.
We naturally have issues to discuss, things to work together on, and I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss this on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, particularly the situation in Syria. We saw that after a very useful meeting in Istanbul the situation has changed.
And of course, this includes the situation in Ukraine, especially with regard to the events of the past several days; we would naturally like to discuss the implementation of the Minsk Agreements.
We would also like to discuss the issues of cybersecurity and the common architecture of security and defence in Europe.
