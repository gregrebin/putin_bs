Meeting with President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Tibilov, I am very happy to see you.
We met just recently, during the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, and you also came on an earlier visit to Russia.
We have matters to discuss. The situation is developing quite dynamically. We have made progress since we signed the agreement on integration and deeper relations. This process has already begun even before the agreement has gone through the ratification procedures, in our State Duma at least.
As you know, I have already sent the relevant instruction to the ministries concerned here, asking them to work with their colleagues in South Ossetia.
It is a great pleasure to see you. Welcome!
President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov
: Thank you.
Mr President, thank you for today’s meeting and for the chance once again to express, on behalf of the entire Ossetian people, our gratitude for the help that you have given our republic.
The impressions that the scale and magnificence of the [Victory Day] celebrations made on me are still fresh in my mind. This celebration unites the many peoples who fought the evil we know as fascism. Our meeting on that occasion and the celebrations themselves brought our peoples closer together. Our relations have reached a new level. We in South Ossetia place great value on our relations with Russia.
The agreement on alliance and integration that we signed needs to be implemented now. Together with our colleagues from the various agencies, we are now drafting the proposals that will form the basis of further agreements needed for the main agreement’s full implementation.
In South Ossetia, we are carrying out an investment programme with our Russian colleagues’ help too. We have achieved decent results in this area thanks to you. Once again, I want to thank you for receiving me today, and wish you good health and a prospering great Russia.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
