Speech at sports festival for large families From a Sport-loving Family to Olympic Victory
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
I offer my warmest greetings to everyone taking part in this festival From a Sport-loving Family to Olympic Victory. Just three months ago, these same arenas hosted the Winter Olympics. Here, at the Adler Arena, the world’s best speed skaters competed and the voices of supporters from all around the world filled the air. Today, these same facilities are being used for hosting mass sport events.
Let me stress that mass sport is not just the foundation for top-level sport and Olympic victories, but for strengthening our nation’s health. Love for sport begins from childhood, starts with the family. Love for sport is incompatible with smoking, alcohol, vodka, and all the more so drugs. Thank you very much to everyone taking part in these competitions.
We have made some progress over recent years. Another six million people have taken up regular sporting activity in Russia. This brings the number of people involved in sport and fitness up to 35 million, but this is still not enough. Over the coming five years we want to take a big stride further and get at least 40 percent of our people regularly engaged in sports and fitness.
I want to say thank you of course to the participants in today’s competitions and to the winners. I appeal to all families throughout Russia and to all officials at every level: we need to do everything we can to support sports enthusiasts such as the people here at the Adler Arena today, and we need to keep moving forward.
Thank you very much. Congratulations on your victories!

Speech at ceremony presenting the Order of Parental Glory
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends,
It is a pleasure to welcome you all here. Yesterday, as we know, was International Children’s Day, a holiday filled with goodness, light and joy. It is symbolic that today we are honouring large families and presenting fathers and mothers with this special state decoration – the Order of Parental Glory.
This decoration, as you know, is awarded in recognition of efforts to strengthen family foundations and traditions, exceptional services in raising children, and your much needed and noble labour as parents. This parental labour requires complete devotion and selfless generosity, constant care and attention for children.
We can all see the results of your work, share your joy and admire your big families and your children’s wonderful faces. I bow low before you and offer you my sincerest congratulations and best wishes.
The families here today come from very different parts of our country. Each family has its own life, history and fate, joys and sorrows. But you all share a common understanding of true values and a sense of mutual respect and love of course. 
It is this that gives you strength and patience, warms you all from young to old, helps you to look after each other, create a truly welcoming home for birth and adopted children and find your place at the big family table and in your parents’ hearts.
Families of this kind, based on solid traditions of continuity and selfless devotion are typical of our people and are Russia’s pride, the true supporting pillar of our country and the guarantee of our society’s moral health. 
It is our sacred duty to preserve and support families. This is why all of our national development plans and projects are ultimately about strengthening families and creating better conditions in Russia for giving birth, raising children and affirming family values.
We see positive demographic trends today. The birth rate is rising, maternal and infant mortality are falling, and the number of families willing to take in and adopt children without parental care is increasing.
These results are not happy coincidence but are the fruit of the hard work that the authorities and people throughout our vast country have done. It is wonderful to see that this effort has not been in vain. Most important of all, it is wonderful to see that people have not lost their generous spirit and that we still have goodness, empathy, warmth and all the brightest and most noble human feelings and desires. Your big, friendly families and the feat you have achieved as parents are convincing proof of this. 
This example can serve as inspiration to many. It gives hope and confidence in tomorrow and in a bright and prosperous future for Russia and its people.
Once again, I congratulate all of the families decorated with the Order of Parental Glory.
I wish you happiness, health, and success.
Thank you for your attention.
<…>
Friends,
I want to congratulate you once more and congratulate all parents. Our country has far more parents than could ever fit in this hall.
I want to thank you from all my heart for your generous spirit, warmth, and the great cause to which you have devoted yourselves.
Thank you very much.

Speech at Belaya Ladya national chess tournament for school teams
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, young sportspeople and chess enthusiasts.
It is a great pleasure to welcome everyone taking part in the final of the Belaya Ladya tournament, which is marking its 45th anniversary in the Olympic city of Sochi. I congratulate you on this occasion.
It used to be that every school throughout the entire country played chess. It is wonderful to see that this tradition is being revived. This year is the tournament’s 45th anniversary, and we see that chess is developing ever more actively in Russia.
This is deservedly so. First of all, Russia has a very rich chess-playing tradition. Second, chess is a sport that develops the individual, the most intellectual sport, and we were always at the top of international ratings in this sport.
I am very happy to see that chess is undergoing a revival in schools in particular. I know that everyone taking part in this final has gone through a long series of difficult selection rounds first, and here today we have our very best young chess players.
Once again, I congratulate you all and wish you all success.
