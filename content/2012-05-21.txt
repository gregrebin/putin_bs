President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Medvedev,
In accordance with the Constitution, you made your proposals for Government Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers and set out your ideas on the Cabinet’s organisation. Everything has been done as we agreed: I met with each of the candidates you recommended for the various posts.
The executive orders have been signed now. I want to wish you and your colleagues good luck. I think the best thing now would be to get the new Government Cabinet members together and announce the appointments.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev
: Mr President,
Thank you for examining so attentively the proposals made and candidates named. This attention from the President is very important for the Government Cabinet’s future members, and so, I think to talk with them now would most certainly be the right thing. Once more, thank you for examining my proposals. 
Vladimir Putin: How many new faces do we have? It seems to me that three quarters of the Cabinet are new people.
Dmitry Medvedev: Yes, by my calculation, the Government Cabinet now is around three quarters made up of people who entered the Government only very recently, or are joining it for the first time.
