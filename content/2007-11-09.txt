The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Mrs President, colleagues,
Allow me to welcome you here at the Kremlin.
I would like to begin by saying that our relations have becoming noticeably more active of late. Our bilateral trade has more than doubled over the last four years. Swiss investment in Russia has doubled over 2007 alone. We very much hope that Russian companies will have the same opportunities to invest in the Swiss economy.
Our economic ties are showing steady and successful growth and we have regular contacts on the international stage and in the political arena, which is also very good to see.
It gives us great pleasure to see you here in Moscow.
Welcome!
President of Switzerland Micheline Calmy-Rey: Thank you very much, Mr President.
It is a great honour and pleasure for us to be received by you here at the Kremlin.
The ties between our two countries are indeed developing rapidly. Geneva has become a major centre for talks on Russian oil. Our economic ties are expanding all the time. Russian imports in Switzerland have increased by 94 percent and our countryâ€™s exports to Russia are up by 45 percent.
We are also very proud of the fact that the humanitarian ties between our countries are expanding. Many Russians come to Switzerland now and the Russian community in our country is growing. I hope we will have the chance to discuss the issue of simplifying the visa procedures between our countries.
