President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Aksyonov
, Mr Ovsyannikov
, we will now discuss matters pertaining to Crimea and Sevastopol.
I wanted us to meet in a small group, just the three of us, because there is a new head of the executive branch in Sevastopol. I very much hope that you will work together, hand in hand, and help and support each other.
We are aware of the numerous issues that need to be addressed here in Crimea in general, and in Sevastopol in particular. The first thing to focus on is constant and systematic work to increase the incomes of the population of Crimea and Sevastopol. You are experienced people, and you are aware that all other issues, such as social matters or housing and utilities, pre-school facilities and schools, hospitals and so on, depend on this.
We have an extensive federal programme for the development of Crimea and Sevastopol that is filled with federal resources. We will now discuss its progress. It is important to fulfill all the activities that are listed there properly and on time. In addition, we agreed that we would release in 2016 an additional 5 billion rubles to repair and build new inland roads. Mr Aksyonov assured me that all these funds would be used properly. A portion of this money will go to Sevastopol, because, to put it mildly, it can be put to good use there.
We have planned to build major federal highways going across the bridge and then across Crimea and to Sevastopol. However, the inland road network is still — as a matter of fact, it was neglected before — in rather poor shape, and it is imperative to make at least the first steps towards improving it.
Let us discuss all of these issues.

Attending the Tavrida National Youth Educational Forum. Graffiti Alley.
The Tavrida National Youth Educational Forum has been held each year since 2014, and lasts from July 1 to August 24 this year, with about three thousand people from Russia and a number of foreign countries attending. The forum is aimed at establishing professional communities among young culture personalities.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: No remarks were planned but I simply cannot leave without saying some kind words to you. As you know, youth centres are off to a good start all over the country. I am referring to the well-known Terra Scientia and Baltic Artek, to name a few platforms. What I saw today stands out among the multitude of such events and venues because this forum gathers people from the creative professions.
Naturally, the place is conducive to creative work and collaboration. I am confident – I just spoke with some budding poets and artists – that when representatives of different crafts interact, it gives added inspiration to each of them.
This is a great thing. I would like to thank not only the organisers, who of course deserve thanks, but also your distinguished, seasoned colleagues who come here, work with you, choose the best of the best and help them at the outset of their creative careers. It is important to note that there is almost always a positive impact in the end. I believe that complicated, challenging situations – and there are plenty of them in life, in fact life consists of them – should have a positive outcome.
I sincerely hope that this sacred place for Russian culture – Tavrida, Crimea – becomes a good cradle for new generations of our writers, poets and filmmakers. It is very important, especially now during the Year of Russian Cinema, that people who want to devote their lives to filmmaking have gathered here. I am confident that with your help, owing to you, we will have many more masterpieces like “War and Peace” and “Mirror.”
I wish you success in your creative endeavours and all the best!
