Beginning of Meeting with Nikolai Levichev, leader of the Fair Russia (Spravedlivaya Rossiya) faction in the State Duma
June 30, 2008
15:26
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Nikolai Vladimirovich, we are about to enter a new stage in municipal reform in our country, or to be more precise, the basic law on municipal development is about to enter fully into force.
A great deal of preparatory work has been carried out. I began working on this when I was Chief of Staff of the President Executive Office. We realised how complicated this is for our country and what difficulties and problems are involved, and this is why the transition to the new municipal system was stretched out over several years.
I know that your party has also paid a lot of attention to this work. How ready do you think the municipalities are now to work according to the new principles, what problems still remain, and what proposals do you have for improving the legislation on municipal development in the country?
Leader of the Fair Russia Faction In the State Duma Nikolai Levichev: Out in the municipalities where people’s real lives are taking place one law is not enough to sort out all the problems in municipal life. It is very important to understand who is working in the local self-government bodies and might later move on to work at regional and federal level. I think that this is an area where the political parties could work, and a chance for them to increase their social role and responsibility. I would like to see a real multiparty system develop here, at the grass-roots level. This would probably greatly improve the human resource base for the political parties and make it better prepared to take on the tasks of anti-corruption work, public control and so on.
We plan to hold a congress of municipal deputies from Fair Russia this autumn. But I think this is a national issue and perhaps even a matter on which the different political parties could achieve consensus, at least regarding ways of working with active members of the public above all in the places where they live and work.
Dmitry Medvedev: I cannot but agree with you. At the moment, unfortunately, the people working in the municipalities do not always have the best preparation, but this is where people live, this is where they encounter all the main problems of daily life: housing and utilities, education, healthcare. This is the epicentre of ordinary daily life. Unfortunately, we only began working on training for municipal officials quite recently. What’s more, it is no secret that people do not move up the career ladder immediately, and as a rule it is the best qualified people who move up (on to regional or federal level), but we need to have skilled and well trained managers at municipal level too. This is precisely an issue the parties could resolve together. What do you think?
Nikolai Levichev: I think it would be good to make the Russian Academy of Federal Service open and accessible not to civil servants but to activists from all parties, at least from the parties represented in parliament.
Dmitry Medvedev: Let’s think about this.

Beginning of Meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
June 30, 2008
19:39
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Minister, I am happy to make your acquaintance and to welcome you to Moscow.
I know that you have had substantial discussions with your counterpart here in the Russian Government.
Russian-American financial and economic relations are strategic in nature. This point was made in particular not so long ago, when the Sochi Declaration was signed. We will continue to do everything within our power to give these relations real substance. Of course, the financial and economic situation inevitably has an impact on the nature and content of these relations, and I am therefore very interested in hearing what you have to say about the current financial situation in the United States and the state of world finances in general.
The G8 summit will take place in a few days time. We will discuss there the global liquidity situation, the financial situation and ways to overcome the crisis. In this context, it would be very interesting to discuss these issues with you today too.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson: Mr President, it is a great honour to meet with you here in Moscow. As you said, I have had plenty of opportunity during this visit and on other occasions to exchange views with Minister Kudrin [Russian Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin]. I think that my dinner with Mr Kudrin, business leaders and the owners of big American and Russian companies gave us the chance to discuss the growing economic trade and commercial relations between our countries.
We also welcome the growing investment: American investment in Russia and vice versa. We welcome the growing trade and commercial relations between our countries and, most importantly, we welcome Russia’s forthcoming accession to the WTO.

Beginning of Meeting with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Leader of the LDPR Faction in the State Duma
June 30, 2008
13:03
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Vladimir Volfovich, the housing problem has long been one of our biggest problems and unfortunately probably will remain so for some time yet. We have begun building a lot more housing lately, but we need to build decent housing, and one of the programmes the Government proposed, a programme I was involved in, was the programme for construction of individual low-rise homes.
I know that the LDPR also thinks this is the right direction for housing construction. I wanted to discuss with you what you think needs to be done, what draft laws should perhaps be adopted in this area and what we can do to develop individual home construction given the great demand for housing that exists.
Leader of the Ldpr Faction In the State Duma Vladimir Zhirinovsky: The housing issue has always been of prime importance because housing means a roof over one’s head for the whole family. What is positive is that we have an enormous amount of available land. In other countries wars are fought for every square kilometre. I have travelled many times all around our country and land is our wealth. We also have abundant construction materials. Squared beams are the most important material for environmentally friendly housing. The Finns and the Canadians both use them, the technology has already been developed, and there is no reason why we cannot do the same.
Dmitry Medvedev: There are new materials too, not just squared beams but layered materials…
Vladimir Zhirinovsky: Yes, there are materials that require practically no finishing at all.
A law could be passed making it possible to make plots of land available faster if they are to be used for housing construction. Loans should be long-term, up to 50 years (as is the practice in Europe). I met with one of my Belgian colleagues and he said, “The house I live in, it was my grandfather who got the loan and started paying it off. He wasn’t able to pay it off completely, so now it is his grandson who is paying it off”. It works out at 15 years for each generation. In other words, this is a long-term loan and it can be guaranteed. This would bring interest rates down to a minimum.
Dmitry Medvedev: Loans made with the land allocated as collateral.
Vladimir Zhirinovsky: Yes, and the value of the land would fully justify making the loan, therefore the banks will not suffer. In any case, the state can help too, and then we will see families starting to develop. Not even higher education is so important then – people will feel the joy of owning their own homes. This would solve the housing and utilities sector’s problems: people will look after their own homes, paint them, repair them. Add to this a small car of some kind. In India, for example, they are starting to produce cars that cost only $2,000. And that is all.
Dmitry Medvedev: It’s a small car?
Vladimir Zhirinovsky: Very small. We can do likewise, using the Oka or some similar type of car. People will have their own home and their own Oka, and then families will start to develop. People will start having more children because they will need more hands to help with the work, and from childhood people will know what it is to be owners. We have all the right conditions for this. This will make people happy because people want to have something of their own. The first thing of their own that people want is a home, and after that comes everything else: a shop, an office and so on.
Dmitry Medvedev: Then we need to look together at what can be done in terms of legislation to speed up the process of getting available land onto the market so that people can actually obtain it. As you know, the municipal and regional authorities are not always keen to part with land. We need to make them realise that there is no other option and that people must be able to get land for individual home building. We need therefore to reflect together on the series of legislative measures needed to make this happen.

Answer to a Journalist's Question after Visiting the Exhibition ”Samurais: The Treasures of Japan's Warrior Nobility“
June 30, 2008
09:58
The Kremlin, Moscow
Question: Dmitry Anatoleyvich, you have visited two exhibitions related to Japanese culture. What are your impressions?
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: The exhibitions were very interesting and absolutely original. They give an idea of how Japan has developed, and of how its crafts, culture and traditions have developed.
It is obvious that Japan’s particularly distinctive culture is far from static: it has changed as society has changed, from ancient times, of course, right up to the present, as evidenced by the swords that the samurai wore, the kimono, and lots of other household items that will no doubt be of interest to anyone who cares about history in general and the history of Japan in particular.
There’s something else I’d like to say: it is very good that this exhibition is taking place within the walls of the ancient Kremlin. This makes for a special sort of feeling: on the one hand, there’s the culture of Japan and, on the other, the space created by ancient Russian culture. This creates a very powerful effect. I think that everyone who visits this exhibition will enjoy it.
My thanks to our Japanese colleagues.
