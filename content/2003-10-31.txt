Vladimir Putin: … I cannot help mentioning one more issue, namely, the unification of two territories. Everything that I have mentioned before is linked with such processes.
I want to stress once again that unification, which has been proposed by the territories themselves, aims to open up broad socio-economic development prospects and to boost the effectiveness of regional and local authorities. In the long run, all this should help accomplish the main objective – raising living standards.
On the eve of the referendum, we must provide timely, regular and exhaustive information about ongoing processes to regional and district residents. It is important that people receive all the required information and can make a well thought-out choice.
I want to stress that the current unification process is taking place in strict conformity with legislative proceedings and confirms the effectiveness of available constitutional mechanisms.
