Ankara, Turkey
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr President, dear ladies and gentlemen,
First of all, I would like to thank the Turkish leadership for the invitation and hospitable reception. And of course, Mr President, for your kind words about Russia. I would like to say right now that these feelings are mutual.
Russia and Turkey are close and long-standing neighbours. And we are linked by many centuries of political and trade relations. The destinies of our peoples are closely intertwined. We remember the dramatic pages of our common history, and of course, the successful joint work and mutual support which we just mentioned, Mr President.
Relying on the experience of generations, we must expand and strengthen Russian-Turkish cooperation. This cooperation, I am sure, must be worthy of our peoples and our nations, which are developing dynamically and have ambitious plans of national development.
We well know the success of the Turkish people in modernising their country, and in strengthening their international and economic positions. We aim for the development of the closest relations with our authoritative, respectable and influential partner. I am certain that this visit will also help us to open new horizons, new areas of cooperation between Russia and Turkey in politics and the economy.
Our meeting is just beginning, and talks are just beginning, but we can already feel our common desire for substantial and productive dialogue. We intend to make bold, breakthrough decisions.
I would like to wish you all successful work, work that is focused on results, for serious, practical returns in the interests of our countries and our peoples.
