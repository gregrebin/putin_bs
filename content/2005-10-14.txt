President Vladimir Putin:
It is not good that bandit raids of this sort are still able to take place here. And it is a great tragedy that there have been casualties among our law enforcement officers and the civilian population.
The victims and their families should all receive help. We will discuss this issue at a meeting with the members of the Security Council.
What is good is that this time, the law enforcement and security agencies all worked smoothly, effectively and firmly. We will continue to act in this same way in the future with regard to whosoever takes up arms and threatens the lives and health of our citizens and the territorial integrity of the Russian state. Our action should provide an adequate response to the threats that the bandits create for our country.
We will be firm and consistent in our action, as we were on this occasion.
