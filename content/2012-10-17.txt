Meeting of the Commission for Military Technology Cooperation with Foreign Countries.
Opportunities for developing military technical cooperation with the BRICS
Group countries and Vietnam were the main subject of discussion, with particular attention focusing on improving the legal framework for military technical cooperation and raising the effectiveness of intergovernmental commissions’ work.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Today, we will discuss how to make our military technical cooperation with foreign countries more effective. Russia is one of the most active players on this global market and we are firmly in second place overall in terms of arms exports around the world. 
We value our reputation as an honest and responsible partner in military technical cooperation. Russia signs arms and military equipment contracts only with lawful and legitimate governments and only for the purposes of ensuring sovereign defence capability. In carrying out our work in this area we always make a comprehensive assessment of the specific situation in each particular part of the world. Far from all of the big arms exporters take as scrupulous an attitude as we do in this area.
Our position is that only sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council are justifiable grounds for not selling arms to particular countries. In all other cases no one has the right under any pretext to dictate to Russia or any other country with whom and how it may conduct trade.
”Russia signs arms and military equipment contracts only with lawful and legitimate governments and only for the purposes of ensuring sovereign defence capability.“
Unilateral or collective bans and restrictions that are outside the UN Security Council framework — all the more so when politically motivated — are not international legal norms with the consequences that ensue. Russia will continue to develop its military technical cooperation and will unfailingly carry out all of its obligations. 
I note that our current export contracts are all being performed exactly as planned. Over the first nine months of this year we delivered military goods worth a total value of $10.7 billion. This accounts for around 80 percent of the total contracts planned for this year. We forecast a slight increase in arms and military equipment exports this year as compared to 2011. Now we need to bolster this positive trend.
Competition on the modern arms and military equipment market is extremely intense. We therefore need to make use of qualitatively new approaches and show flexibility and ability to make timely responses. This is the basis upon which we will develop our military technical cooperation with our partners from the BRICS Group – Brazil, India, China, and South Africa, and also with Vietnam. We will discuss all of this in detail today.
The BRICS countries have been steadily gaining in political, economic and technological weight over these last years and have been posting stable, high growth rates. Between them, the BRICS countries account for 43 percent of the world’s population and around a fifth of global GDP.
We have established a constructive dialogue within the group and are successfully coordinating action on a broad range of issues on the global and regional agendas. We are actively developing our trade and investment ties. 
As far as military technical cooperation goes, India and China are both longstanding key partners for Russia. We see good prospects for developing this area of relations with Brazil and South Africa too. 
Vietnam is another longstanding partner of ours in this sector. There was a hiatus in the 1990s, but now we are steadily building up our military technical cooperation once again.
”Deepening civilised, honest and mutually-advantageous partnership in the military technical cooperation sector gives us a very valuable instrument for guaranteeing our foreign policy interests.“
Given the growing technological, industrial and scientific potential of the countries I mentioned, our military technical cooperation with them can and must move to a qualitatively new level.
What do I mean by a qualitatively new level? I am referring to deeper production cooperation and joint R&D, establishing effective maintenance and post-sale service systems, and working together to enter third countries’ markets. 
As you know, our cooperation with India is not limited to delivering ready-made models of our defence industry’s goods. Joint R&D work and licensed production, including for supply to other countries, are also gaining more importance.
There are clear advantages here: joint production makes it possible to cut production costs, obtain and introduce new technology, including dual-purpose technology, and organise a rational system for transferring technology from the defence to the civil sector. 
At the same time, Russian manufacturers’ intellectual property rights and the globally recognised Russian brands must be fully protected from unlawful copying.
We should also use military technical cooperation mechanisms for obtaining foreign technology and individual samples needed for developing our own defence industry. 
I think we all realise that simply purchasing foreign military goods without mastering the production process here in Russia itself does not make sense.
On another issue, we also need to improve the legal framework for military technical cooperation and update our bilateral and multilateral agreements in line with today’s reality. Most important of all, we need to develop a long-term cooperation programme. 
We need to raise intergovernmental commissions’ effectiveness in order to strengthen coordination with our key partners, and arrange regular meetings between experts and specialists. 
In general, deepening civilised, honest and mutually-advantageous partnership in the military technical cooperation sector gives us a very valuable instrument for guaranteeing our foreign policy interests. This is an integral part of our efforts to counter global threats and challenges. As you know, the Executive Order on implementing Russia’s foreign policy set out the tasks in this area.
I ask you to keep in mind that the approach I have outlined in military technical cooperation, especially as concerns work with our traditional partners, is a priority. 
Let’s discuss all of this now.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, it is a great pleasure to meet with you again and to see you here in Moscow.
Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (translated from Russian): I too am pleased to have this meeting, Your Excellency.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you for accepting our invitation.
Let me note that relations between our countries are developing well and our trade is growing. We maintain ongoing political contact. Some of our companies are carrying out projects together, big projects what’s more, not just in the energy sector, but also in the metals industry, construction, and infrastructure. It is very important to see that our investment cooperation is developing and that the movement is going in both ways. Our ties in the sensitive sector of military technical cooperation are also growing.
We are very happy to see you and wish you welcome.
His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan: Thank you, Your Excellency.
I am pleased to be here in this country that I consider my second home.
Our relations are indeed developing steadily and we place great importance on these ties and their continued advancement.
Our visit to Moscow today clearly demonstrates our sincere desire to discuss with you the opportunities for developing the whole spectrum of relations between Moscow and Abu Dhabi.

Meeting with VTB Bank Chairman and CEO Andrei Kostin
During the meeting, which took place late the previous evening, Mr Kostin briefed Vladimir Putin on the services the bank offers to the public, including a new consumer lending scheme and expansion of the bank’s regional branch network.

With VTB Bank Chairman and CEO Andrei Kostin.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, Mr Kostin.
VTB Bank Chairman and CEO Andrei Kostin
: Good evening, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Kostin, you have an interesting new project underway. What is the project’s name – Summer Bank?
Andrei Kostin: That’s right, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Tell me about it.
Andrei Kostin: VTB Group places a lot of importance on working with the public. This is reflected in our figures: for the first time, the volume of loans we extended to individuals in the first three quarters of this year broke the 1 trillion-ruble mark, and we expect to increase this figure by a further 15 percent by the end of the year. As for mortgage loans, this year will see their volume double overall from 80 billion rubles last year to 160 billion roubles this year.
But we think that a big share of the general public, around 20 million people by our estimates, are still not getting all the banking services they could be. These people tend to be low-income earners living in smaller towns around the country. To address this problem, we decided last week to launch a new project, which we have named Summer Bank. The focus groups we conducted show that this name is a positive choice because everyone likes summer.
We plan to open around 1,000 small branches over the next three years, mostly in the regional capitals and smaller towns, and we want to attract as many as five million new customers. We will basically focus on small loans. For example, a family with a 15,000-ruble monthly income could borrow the equivalent of their monthly income for whatever needs they might have. The branches will have a new-look format. They will have a welcoming atmosphere and open layout without the usual partitions, and will look more like…
Vladimir Putin: What will this give the public? What are the advantages for them in these banking services?
Andrei Kostin: It’s about us reaching out to the public. For a start, we are bringing banking services closer to them and offering services to people who banks were never so interested in working with in the past because the loans involved are only small but each loan involves a lot of time and work, as you end up with small loans but a lot of them.
This makes speed and information technology very important. We will use the internet and cell phones so that people can get small loans, make settlements, payments and money transfers fast, without having to wait in line and come to the bigger towns and so on. They will do this through the Summer Bank, which will provide the new infrastructure.
Vladimir Putin: So, this is a bank focused on work with individuals?
Andrei Kostin: It will work only with individuals.
Vladimir Putin: I hope the project will be carried out and people will see its benefits.
Andrei Kostin: Thank you.

Working meeting with newly appointed Regional Development Minister Igor Slyunyayev
Vladimir Putin and Mr Slyunyayev discussed the main tasks on the Ministry’s agenda, in particular the relocation of citizens from unfit housing.

With Regional Development Minister Igor Slyunyayev.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Slyunyayev, the Prime Minister recommended you for the post of Regional Development Minister. We have known each other for a long time now, but I nevertheless wanted to meet with you to discuss this new appointment. What do you see as the Ministry’s main tasks today?
This is not a new area of work for you, given that you were governor of one of the Central Federal District’s regions for a long time, and so you have hands-on experience of work in the regions, but running a ministry is nonetheless a responsibility of a different level and involves tasks of a bigger scale.
I propose that we go over the whole range of issues.
Regional Development Minister Igor Slyunyayev
: Thank you, Mr President.
First, I think the main task at this stage is to analyse your instructions to the Regional Development Ministry and address in comprehensive fashion the problems in the housing sector, urban development, and housing and utilities.
The second priority is related to the budget’s passage through the State Duma, given that the federal targeted programmes and federal special investment programmes are instruments that can have a big impact on the situation in the regions. 
The third task is analysing the construction market – industrial, civil, housing, and transport construction – and finding mechanisms for bringing down project, design and construction costs.
Another priority is to establish constructive dialogue with the regions. I firmly believe that the country’s strength lies in its regions, and we need to make this a two-way street: the federal government sets standards and provides assistance, and the regions give feedback and provide support for the federal initiatives.
Vladimir Putin: The Ministry has many tasks before it, but there is one issue I want you not to forget under circumstances. You must give it your particular attention. This is the issue of relocating people from the housing that is old and no longer fit for residence. We have a programme in this area and have earmarked the funds for it, and it is important that every ruble be spent effectively and that time not be wasted in resolving the problems that have built up in this area over decades. Most important of all is to adopt the regulations and rules that will ensure that practical work is organised in such fashion as to steadily reduce the share of this kind of old and unfit housing in the housing stock, and under no circumstances let it increase. This is a task that requires particular determination, inventiveness, and good management skills. 
I hope that you will ensure this is the case, and I ask you to give this issue your particular attention.
Igor Slyunyayev: Thank you, Mr President.
I want to say thank you for the Housing and Utilities Reform Facilitation Fund, which is a very effective instrument that has helped us to tackle this housing problem over the last few years.
One more task that will be on the agenda right from the start is ensuring that the heating season goes smoothly throughout the whole country.
Vladimir Putin: That is without question.
