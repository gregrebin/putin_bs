President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on the launch of the Verkhne-Munskoye diamond field.
There is a lot of hard work ahead of us, although much has been done already. The launch of this field will certainly reinforce the positions of ALROSA, our leading diamond company, as an international leader. It currently accounts for 27 percent of global diamond production. The launch of the new field is an important and positive event not only for the company, but also for Yakutia, the Russian Far East and the rest of Russia.
The Verkhne-Munskoye diamond field will be the main employer for the nearby mining and processing plant and the city of the same name. New jobs will be created, increasing payments to all budgets, including the budget of Yakutia. However, one of the priorities during such projects is environmental protection. I know that the necessary tests have been conducted, yet I ask you to pay special attention to this aspect, along with such issues as health and workplace safety of all those who work or will work at this facility.
It is a huge field. Several kimberlite pipes will be mined there. This project is designed to last until 2040 or 2042. Much will need to be done here. But there are also positive sides to it, because, as I said, this project will contribute to the sustainable development of Yakutia and the whole of the Russian Far East.
I congratulate you on the launch of this huge project and wish you success.
Mr Siluanov, please.
First Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov: Thank you, Mr President.
This is, indeed, the first project of this scale in Russia’s contemporary history. The field was discovered over 60 years ago, yet work began here only in 2015. It is true that this field will produce over 2 million carats of diamonds a year, or some 7 percent of ALROSA’s diamond production.
You mentioned the budget. Indeed, we have invested only 5 billion rubles but expect some 180 billion rubles of revenue from this field during its life. Half of this money will go to Yakutia’s budget and will be spent on attaining the goals facing the republic. Importantly, this field will create over 800 new jobs, which is very important for the region.
Overall, we have a positive view on the company’s performance. It has reported solid financial results. It is a highly efficient company that creates new jobs. I think that the launch of the new field is very important for the performance of this major company, a global company with high international standing.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Ivanov, go ahead please. You have the floor.
ALROSA CEO Sergei Ivanov: Mr President,
We are based in the Arctic Circle, 170 kilometres away from the town of Udachny. This is ALROSA’s northernmost fundamental diamond deposit containing more than 44 million carats. We plan to extract up to 3 million tonnes of ore per year for the next 20 years, and to enrich about 2 million carats of diamonds. Due to our company’s technological needs, special trains with a lifting capacity of 95 tonnes were designed, which will transport the ore to the processing plant.
Production at the deposit uses the most advanced technologies and the share of Russian suppliers has been maximised. Total investment in the project will amount to about 60 billion rubles; effectively, 16 billion rubles have already been invested.
With your permission, I will now give the floor to Head of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Aisen Nikolayev.
Head of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Aisen Nikolayev: Mr President, friends,
The Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) is a region with unique natural, economic and human resources. Today's event once again shows that Yakutia is developing, and is directed towards the future.
I would like to thank ALROSA for using the Far East development mechanisms we are implementing on your instructions, Mr President, to launch a large-scale production in extreme climatic conditions in such a short time. This is more than just another ALROSA production development project, but 800 new jobs for the local people, additional tax revenues, and stable work of ALROSA for decades to come.
It is doubly gratifying that ALROSA complies with all the ethnological and environmental expertise requirements while implementing this project.
Mr President,
We will continue monitoring these issues. During the preparations for launching the project, ALROSA signed an agreement with the national Evenk Oleneksky District of Sakha (Yakutia) to provide annual support in the amount of 100 million rubles to preserve the original habitat of the minorities of the Far North. I am sure that ALROSA will continue to develop for the benefit of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), and for the benefit of our great Motherland, the Russian Federation. Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Nikolayev, how long have you been serving as the acting head of the republic?
Aisen Nikolayev: Five months, and Mr Ivanov for one year.
Vladimir Putin: I am talking about you. You see, five months, and you already have a chance to help launch such a large project. Moreover, the plant is called Udachny, and the town involved in the project, Udachny [the Russian for “lucky”]. It is a good name. I hope you will be lucky with all your work as well.
Go ahead, please.
Aisen Nikolayev: Thank you, Mr President.
Sergei Ivanov: Mr President,
Please give your go-ahead for the Verkhne-Munskoye diamond field to begin commercial operation and carry out the first explosion.
Vladimir Putin: Go ahead.
I congratulate you and wish success to you and to all the employees of your company. All the best! Thank you.

With the President of Moldova Igor Dodon.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
I am very pleased to see you.
To begin with, I would like to note that we attach great importance to promoting Russia-Moldova relations. We consider Moldova to be one of our priority CIS partners. Thanks to your personal efforts, the situation has been improving recently, especially in terms of trade and economic relations. Many new winemaking and agricultural companies work specifically in the Russian market.
Last year, imports from Moldova to Russia grew by over 40 percent, and this trend continues unabated with imports climbing another 14 percent in the first half of 2018. In general, our relations in this area are developing steadily. I hope this will continue into the future.
We will have an opportunity to discuss the entire range of our relations.
We are very pleased to have you here. Welcome.
President of Moldova Igor Dodon
: Mr President, colleagues,
Moldova and the Russian Federation enjoy traditionally friendly and brotherly strategic relations. This is how it was, it is, and will be, and no one, I am positive, will ever be able to destroy them.
We have good partnership relations in at least six areas. We have common interests when it comes to our spiritual values. We share the same values, and the Moldavian Church is part of the Russian Orthodox Church. I have just met with His Holiness [Patriarch Kirill] and discussed the situation in Moldova.
Our nations share centuries-old history. We have close economic ties.
You mentioned the growth in trade during this and last year. We managed to turn around the 2013–2016 trend, and there has been an increase in trade over the past two years.
With regard to apples, grapes and the like, the Russian market accounts for up to 80–90 percent of Moldova’s total exports. Exports of other items, such as wine, remain minor, as we have not had the chance to regain our former volumes yet.
Russia remains the number one investor in Moldova in its 27 years of independence.
The fourth important area has to do with the fact that more than half a million of our citizens work in Russia, transferring over $1 billion to their families every year.
The fifth is that, of course, Russia is our strategic partner in the Transnistria issue. You are aware that I have met four times with the leader of Transnistria over the past 18 months. These contacts are continuing, and we will meet again before the end of the year. I want to note once again that Russian peacekeepers are the guarantors of peace on the Dniester River. That is what the overwhelming majority of citizens on the left and on the right bank think.
The sixth is, of course, we have good cooperation at the multinational level. I mean the CIS, and I want to thank you once again for the fact that, upon your initiative and with your help, we have obtained observer status in the Eurasian Economic Union. This is our first experience. We have already participated in two of the working group meetings at the presidential level, and we will definitely participate in this format. We find it very interesting.
I want to thank you for your openness. I want to confirm the position of the Moldovan leadership and the majority of Moldovan citizens. We are striving to deepen our strategic partnership with Russia. Yes, we want to be friends with everyone, but we will not be friends with anyone just to oppose someone. You are aware of my position. We will defend this position, and I am sure that things will work out well for us.
Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: It was your initiative to move closer to the EAEU. I think these actions helped increase the exports of Moldovan agricultural products to the Russian market.
As for the wine making supplies and wine from Moldova, the numbers are growing.
Igor Dodon: They are.
Vladimir Putin: Last year, 14 million litres were imported, whereas in the first half of this year 8.5 million meaning that we will see a significant increase by the end of the year. We will continue with this.
I think your visit today will also be beneficial for our relations.
Igor Dodon: Thank you very much.
