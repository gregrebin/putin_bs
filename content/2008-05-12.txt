I want to congratulate you all on your appointments. The Russian Federation Government has now been formed and has begun work. Some of you will now begin carrying out new responsibilities, while others will continue work with which you are already much familiar. But in all cases there is much work ahead. We are all aware of what awaits, for the country has a many tasks before it.
