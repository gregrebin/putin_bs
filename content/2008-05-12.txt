President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Colleagues,
I want to congratulate you all on your appointments. The Russian Federation Government has now been formed and has begun work. Some of you will now begin carrying out new responsibilities, while others will continue work with which you are already much familiar. But in all cases there is much work ahead. We are all aware of what awaits, for the country has a many tasks before it.
I want to wish all the members of the Russian Government success in their work.
Thank you and until our next meeting.

Beginning of a Working Meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
May 12, 2008
17:23
The Kremlin, Moscow
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin: Dmitry Anatolyevich,
The necessary proposals regarding the Government’s structure and the appointment of deputy prime ministers and federal ministers have been drawn up, as we agreed. I ask you to examine them. We can go over them together again if need be, primarily the organisational proposals, of course, but also the personnel appointments, because as you know, given that we have already been discussing this for some time, there are some new names.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Yes, Vladimir Vladimirovich.
The situation was such that we had sufficient time to plan the Government’s organization and work out the personnel appointments. We have been working closely together on all these matters for the last two months and we are therefore ready to turn to these proposals now and take all the necessary decisions.
