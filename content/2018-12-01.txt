President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, my dear friend,
Colleagues, once again, allow me to offer my heartfelt greetings to you.
We work together on a regular basis at numerous platforms, including on the sidelines of various international events. Right now, we are meeting here, in Latin America, Argentina, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. We always use such opportunities for the benefit of developing our bilateral relations.
Meeting with President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
Mr President, we are preparing for your visit to Russia next year. And I know that you have already received our offer to schedule this visit to coincide with the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Please review your schedule. If it is possible to time these two events together, we will be happy to see you there as our main guest.
I would like to acknowledge the efficient cooperation between our governments. Just recently, the Russian Prime Minister visited China and I know that you received him. I met with the Premier of the State Council of China in Singapore.
I believe that this continuous work at the top level and at the level of government agencies is bringing results because our trade is developing and we have every chance of reaching a turnover of $100 billion this year. We can see that our Chinese partners, our friends, are making intense efforts towards this goal and we are working just as hard on our part.
We have an extensive bilateral agenda. I am glad to see you here in Argentina.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Mr President, my long-time friend,
Ministers, colleagues,
I am very glad to meet with you here in Buenos Aires, in Latin America.
This year has been special in the history of China-Russia relations because both countries successfully completed their main domestic political agendas thus opening a new historic chance for the development of our countries.
Relations between China and Russia correspond to the demands of our time, as well as the shared aspirations of our peoples. They have a huge potential and a broad appeal.
During a meeting with President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
Next year, we are planning a great number of important events. Our country will mark the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China as well as 70 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. We can take this opportunity to expand cooperation in various fields and achieve practical results.
I am grateful for your invitation. It will be my pleasure to visit Russia next year and attend the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. On the same note, I would like to invite you to attend the second Belt and Road summit in late April.
We will have extensive contacts next year. I am certain that in light of these close contacts, Russian-Chinese relations will be achieving new results and goals across all areas.

Russia–India–China meeting
December 1, 2018
00:20
Buenos Aires
On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Vladimir Putin took part in the Russia–India–China (RIC) meeting with Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi
and President of China Xi Jinping
.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: First, I would like to express my gratitude to our Indian and Chinese partners for supporting the initiative of a trilateral meeting.
I would like to note that Russia, India and China are bound by a centuries-long history of friendly relations, which we are building on the principles of neighbourliness, equality and mutual respect.
The last time when the RIC leaders held talks was 12 years ago, in 2006 in St Petersburg. They were indeed productive, with one of the results being the establishment of BRICS.

Since then, our foreign ministers have held regular consultations. We have maintained links between our security councils, youth and academic communities.
We believe that RIC has great prospects and cooperation within this trilateral format may efficiently complement the cooperation between our countries on a bilateral basis and within BRICS.
We proposed organising this meeting today because the situation in the world and the processes in our common region, Eurasia, require closer coordination of the three countries’ approaches. Mainly, with respect to ensuring security and building constructive inter-state relations, considering an extensive contribution of our three countries to the global development, which is around 30 percent of the world’s GDP at purchasing power parity.
It is important to adjust cooperation on the key issues of the economic agenda, including within the G20, to jointly protect the principles of just and honest competition in world trade and finance, and to assist in shaping the most open system of international economic relations that would be free of protectionism and politically motivated restrictions.
We could also get more actively involved in aligning large integration projects currently carried out with our countries’ involvement such as the Eurasian Economic Union and China’s Belt and Road initiative. New prospects arise for strengthening contacts between the ten ASEAN states and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi at a meeting in the Russia-India-China format.
Friends, I expect that this meeting will be productive and we can further establish a regular schedule for such meetings. Specifically, they could happen on the sidelines of major summits and international events.
Of course, it is important to continue trilateral coordination at other levels, and, when necessary, create additional mechanisms of cooperation. Thank you.
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi (retranslated): Colleagues,
Your Excellencies,
I am glad to have this opportunity to have an informal top-level meeting here in Buenos Aires. It is the first summit in this format since the RIC summit in 2006 in St Petersburg.
I want to thank President Putin for initiating this informal meeting at the top level, which gives us an opportunity to freely and openly discuss some key matters that cause concern on the global level.
Your Excellencies, without a doubt, the world today is going through a period of serious change, instability and growing geopolitical tensions. There is serious pressure being exerted on the global leadership.
At a meeting in the Russia-India-China format.
Multilateral relations and the world order based on common rules are being increasingly rejected by various unilateral, transnational and local groups, and different nations around the world. We can see this happening as sanctions are imposed outside the UN mandate and protectionist policies are gaining strength.
The Doha Development Agenda within the WTO has failed. Since the Paris Agreement, we have not seen the expected level of financial commitment on behalf of the developed countries in favour of the developing states. Therefore, when it comes to climate, justice is currently at risk. We are still very far from achieving the goals of sustainable development.
Certain weak economies are still vulnerable to natural disasters. In this international context, key powers like India, Russia and China bear a particularly big responsibility.
Our three countries account for one-third of the global population. We must support the politics of multilateral relations, work towards creating a multilateral world order for this purpose, as well as ensure compliance with international law.
In the RIC format, we must work on four aspects: regional and global stability, economic prosperity, exchange of experience in areas of mutual interest, and cooperation in response to new and recurring challenges as well as existing challenges.
President of China Xi Jinping at a meeting in the Russia-India-China format.
I agree with President Putin. Whenever we meet on the sidelines of international events, we must find an opportunity to hold such top-level RIC meetings. I believe that currently there is a growing need for us three to meet and cooperate more frequently.
We must play a special role at the global arena as well as seek ways to drive our countries’ development forward. I would like to thank President Putin once again for restoring and giving a new lease of life to this format.
President of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): Colleagues,
It is a great pleasure for me to be here with President Putin and Prime Minister Modi for an informal RIC meeting. I would like to thank Russia for organising this event.
China, Russia and India are three big countries that are making a serious contribution to global development. We are partners in global development, strategic partners. We have common interests and similar development goals.
We also bear a special responsibility for the future of the region and the world in general. Right now the world is facing new risks and challenges. Therefore, common development and close cooperation between our three countries in this context is becoming increasingly important for global stability and predictability.
At a meeting in the Russia-India-China format.
In the past ten years, our three countries have been involved in an active dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of openness, solidarity, mutual understanding and trust.
We succeeded in achieving serious progress in this area. I hope that this meeting will also result in thorough talks with Prime Minister Modi and President Putin on RIC cooperation in the new environment, in order to improve our consensus, cooperation and coordination so that together we can promote peace in the whole world, stability and development.

We use every opportunity to touch base on cooperation in the most important areas. We are glad that we now have a busy joint work schedule.
Just recently, two weeks ago, we met in Singapore, and now we are meeting here. We travel to different parts of the globe. But wherever we are, you and I have a meeting. I am very pleased about that.

(retranslated): Mr President, I am glad to meet with you again here, in accordance with the agreement we reached in Singapore.
I would like to expand our cooperation in all areas to take Japan-Russia relations to a new level.
In particular, I would like to further develop our cooperation in mutual economic activities, as well as humanitarian measures for the former residents of the islands, including regular visits to the gravesites in their homeland.
I would also like to more actively promote Japanese-Russian cooperation in the sphere of security.
I hope we will have a detailed discussion today, mainly on the issues related to the peace treaty with due account of the results of our meeting in Singapore.
