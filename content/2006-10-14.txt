The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon! I am very glad to see you! I am very pleased to meet with you once again.
I note with satisfaction that our contacts are proceeding very intensively and at the very highest level.
In connection with this I except to soon meet the President of the People’s Republic of China, Hu Jintao, in Vietnam during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. And in the near future the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation is planning a visit to the People’s Republic of China.
As far as I know, the Year of Russia in China is proceeding rather well and at quite a high level. We are ready for a similar event in the Russian Federation.
The volume of trade between our countries is growing.
Our contacts on the international arena are essential and important in order to coordinate our positions on various international problems, including the most sensitive and problematic ones. The situation surrounding the Korean nuclear programme is certainly one of these problems.
We are very glad to exchange opinions with you on a whole range of issues, including about the problem that I just mentioned.
Tang Jiaxuan: Thank you very much, Mr President, for taking the time to meet with my colleagues and myself. This time I came to Moscow as the special representative of Hu Jintao in order to meet with you and other Russian authorities and exchange opinions on the Korean nuclear problem.
