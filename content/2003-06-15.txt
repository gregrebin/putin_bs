Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
It is an event of great significance that has brought us here today, as we honour the first recipients of the international Global Energy Awards.
The Global Energy prize is awarded for exceptional scientific achievement in the field of energy. I would like to point out that this is the first such award in the world.
The international Global Energy Awards was conceived and created as a prize of the new millennium. I think it is profoundly symbolic and natural that this new award has been founded on the initiative of Russia, one of the recognised leaders in the world energy market, and a country that has great experience in international energy cooperation.
The major Russian energy companies gave this project their support, and their directors are present here today. These companies understand very well just what part science and new technologies can play in their development.
We live at a time when the challenges that face humanity are global in nature and concern each and every one of us. The only way to come up with effective solutions is for the entire international community to unite its intellectual and technological potential.
One of the biggest problems we face in the modern world is supplying people all over the planet and the global economy with energy. We need to look for ways to use our energy resources more effectively, including from an environmental point of view.
One of our most important challenges is to develop alternative energy sources that will play a huge part in the future of our entire civilisation.
Moreover, global energy dialogue can contribute to rapid economic growth and help solve urgent social issues. Of course, the scientific community plays a key part in developing this dialogue.
The aim of the international Global Energy Awards is to support and encourage research of vital importance for all of humanity.
I want to offer my sincere congratulations to the awardâ€™s first recipients, Nick Holonyak, Gennady Mesyats and Ian Douglas Smith. They all have exceptional achievements to their names and have obtained significant results. I wish them further scientific success and all the best.
I am sure that the Global Energy Awards will always maintain the highest degree of prestige and authority, and that their recipients will do much to help develop the international energy dialogue and strengthen cooperation among scientists in the name of progress and global economic development.
Thank you for your attention.
