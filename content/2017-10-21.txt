President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends. Greetings.
The festival week in Sochi, in Russia is approaching its end. However, I am confident that it benefited the 30,000 young people who came to our country from around the world. Thank you for your trust.
I congratulate everyone who actively participated in the festival’s events. I know that an unusual, absolutely exceptional energy reigned at the festival, as it still reigns on this square. It is the energy of the young. I am sure that as you depart from Russia, you will leave behind a piece of your heart, while Russia will stay in your heart forever. We believe in you.
(Speaking English) The future starts here and now. The future is you. All the best, dear friends. All the best. Thank you.
