Meeting with President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, friends,
We meet regularly and quite frequently, but we always have something to discuss, because we are truly friends. Moreover, we have more and more areas where we are working together, including within the framework of our integration processes.
These are difficult times, but that forces us to exchange views more actively on ways to overcome difficult situations, where to go and how quickly, and what we must do together to ensure this movement is as effective as possible.
I am very happy for this opportunity. I welcome you once again.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: Thank you, Mr Putin.
Naturally, I am also very happy for this opportunity to once again meet with you, to talk with you and discuss the progress made in implementing our joint agreements. I am very glad that this is happening ahead of the New Year.
We always hope for the best in the New Year. I hope that next year will be wonderful for the great Russian nation and for our people, that we will always be together and always have good things to discuss.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Almazbek Atambayev: I hope we will have only blue skies ahead.
Vladimir Putin: Very well.
