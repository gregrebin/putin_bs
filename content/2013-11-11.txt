With President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
President OF RUSSIA VLADIMIR PUTIN: Mr Nazarbayev, let me welcome you to Russia, to this region not far from Kazakhstan. It is not by chance that we chose Yekaterinburg as the venue for our meeting, given that the main subject of today’s meeting and discussion is cooperation between our two countries’ regions. 
We have been leading this work for a long time now, or I should say rather that we have been supporting it at the highest level. Our colleagues are working very intensively and productively, coming up with many interesting projects.
I want to say at the start of our meeting that since the Customs Union
has been in full operation our trade results have shown a substantial improvement. At the same time, I note that the flow of goods from Kazakhstan to Russia is growing much faster than that of Russian goods to Kazakhstan.
The growth last year was of 20 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The flow of goods from Kazakhstan to Russia increased by 20 percent, while Russia’s deliveries to Kazakhstan were up by 8.5 percent. The situation has changed a little this year, with Russian supplies to Kazakhstan now up by slightly more than 13 percent, while the figure for Kazakhstan’s goods coming into Russia is a little over 20 percent. Such is the trend, but we are not discouraged by it. On the contrary, we are sure we will eventually reach a balance that will be good for both economies.
In any case, we are very pleased to see you, and I am sure that we will have an interesting, intensive and useful discussion.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Mr Putin, thank you for this opportunity to meet with you and discuss our bilateral relations.
We began our interregional cooperation a decade ago now. Today, our meeting marks the Forum’s tenth anniversary. Of course we have accomplished a lot over this time, and this has served as the base for building the Customs Union. Now we are moving to the next level of integration. This is something we are all working on. 
The neighbouring regions in our countries have established joint ventures and developed trade ties over recent years. We see that 70 percent of our bilateral trade is between these neighbouring regions. Today, we are meeting in Yekaterinburg, Russia’s industrial heart. This is a region that is close to us and with which we have historic ties.
We have huge opportunities. Supplies of raw materials, ferrous alloys and bauxites from Kazakhstan make up a big share of our trade. Our reciprocal investment has increased, and our exports and imports have also grown of late. Russia has a very good statistics agency. We are here just talking, but the Russian statistics agency shows very clearly that the situation is picking up. The main thing is that the business community is happy and trade is growing. I think that the Customs Union, Common Economic Space
and the future Eurasian Economic Union open up even more new opportunities for cooperation.

Visit to Ural Locomotives company.
The President visited the production floor of the locomotive plant, viewed the pre-commissioning units and talked with the company’s staff. Vladimir Putin congratulated workers on the launch of Lastochka train production.
The company is engaged in designing, producing, selling and servicing traction rolling stock, specialising in the production of Sinara and Granit electric freight locomotives and Lastochka electric passenger trains.
Conversation with workers at Ural Locomotives plant.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I congratulate you on the start of this work.
Replies: Thank you.
Valdimir Putin: Congratulations. Your managers have told me that the staff here will continue to grow. Right now, you have about 3,000 employees, don’t you?
Sinara Group CEO Dmitry Pumpyansky: 3,300.
Vladimir Putin: And their number will increase to 4,500?
Dmitry Pumpyansky: That’s right, to 4,500. Currently, we have 300 people working here, at this location, including 159 who were trained in Germany. The staff here will increase to 1,500.
Vladimir Putin: I hope this is interesting for you.
Remarks: Yes, of course.
We are developing very dynamically, thanks to orders for the future. We have made a major step forward and the management is doing everything possible for us to become stronger. We have enormous potential – these are people who can work even more and better for the good of our homeland.
Vladimir Putin: I do not doubt it. I must say, this is impressive, this scale and quality, and the number of workers. You’re paying good salaries that are nearly 30% higher than the region’s average. The salaries here are about 39,000 rubles, and the average for the region is 27,000. So the difference is significant. Of course, it has to do with the workers’ level of training and high technologies. This is one of the region’s high-tech centres.
I am confident that the outlook is good; we will continue to develop rail network in the country. Mr Yakunin knows that despite the general economic problems, infrastructure is nevertheless an area where we will invest money and resources. We have already invested 20 billion rubles, a very significant sum. I wish you success and all the very best.
Question: Mr President, I am a mechanic working in commissioning operations for the Lastochka train. I trained in Germany, which has a very good high-speed train network and a rail pass system. I heard that Moscow wants to implement a similar project soon. I wanted to ask if our company will participate in that project as an electric train supplier?
Vladimir Putin: Are you referring to the Moscow ring road?
Reply: Yes, and our Lastochka.
Vladimir Putin: This is a good question. I can tell they prepared you well. (Laughter.)
Remark: We want stability. After all, this is our future.
Vladimir Putin: All the orders will be placed on a tender basis. But I don’t think you have a lot of competitors – practically none.
Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser (retranslated): You can be proud of such young people.
Vladimir Putin (in German): We are.
Question: Mr President, everyone knows that Lastochka trains will be used to transport passengers during the 2014 Winter Olympics. I would like to ask, will the Lastochka be used at the Football World Cup?
Vladimir Putin: We are currently looking at different ways to transport fans more comfortably and quickly to match locations. Naturally, your Lastochkas will be in demand.
I do not want to say anything too soon, before I’m ready, but it is obvious that this will be included in the general programme for preparing the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It is hard for me to say now what kind of technology will be used and in what areas, but it is absolutely clear, we all realise it, that yours are currently the only Lastochka trains out there.
Remark: This is very important for us.
Vladimir Putin: There’s a very good chance that your participation in the Olympic project will be followed by joining in the preparations for the FIFA World Cup.
Question: My son is going to graduate from high school soon and would like to follow in my footsteps. Would you advise him to go into machine engineering?
Vladimir Putin: You should advise him; you’re the father.
Question: But what is the situation overall? Will there be stability in the future? And what about training? Will machine engineering develop?
Vladimir Putin: Of course. A powerful, large economy such as Russia cannot develop or exist without its own machine engineering. Of course, it will develop. We are cooperating with our German friends. Our economic volume is comparable to German’s economy. Russia is the world’s fifth biggest economy, but we need to achieve the same level of quality. Together, we have every opportunity. They are interested, and it is advantageous for them to work with us. We are reliable partners, we pay on time, and we have large orders. But the opportunities presented by their technologies are advantageous for us as well.
Without machine engineering, Russia’s economy will not develop at all. Everyone realises this. This is a difficult direction, it is not like hydrocarbons and does not bring quick profits, but it is a key direction. As for staff, the companies themselves need to think about it in advance, together with the government. The government alone will not do it, because the government never senses the needs of the labour market. It would also be hard for businesses to do it on their own, so they need support. We are currently working on this together.
Take care. Goodbye.

Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum
Vladimir Putin and President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev took part in the 10th Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum, with Industrial Cooperation as the anniversary event’s theme.

Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum.
Following the forum, the two presidents oversaw the signing of a package of agreements on transporting oil via Kazakhstan, expanding and intensifying industrial cooperation, collaboration on developing the Imashevskoye gas condensate field, and preventing and fighting wildfires in the two countries’ border regions.
Mr Putin and Mr Nazarbayev signed the Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan on Good-Neighbourliness and Alliance in the 21st Century.
The two presidents later made press statements.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, friends,
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum, which is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. Since the heads of our neighbouring regions first met in Omsk in 2003, the interregional forum has proven its usefulness and clear effectiveness. Today, 76 of Russia’s 93 regions have economic ties with all 14 regions in Kazakhstan, and also with the cities of Astana and Almaty. More than 200 interregional agreements on cooperation in various areas have been signed. 
Kazakhstan has become a leading trade partner for many Russian regions, including Tatarstan, Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk and Orenburg regions. Each of these regions has trade now exceeding $1 billion with partners in Kazakhstan. This gives a huge boost to developing our bilateral economic ties. Our bilateral trade has quadrupled over the last 10 years, from $5.8 billion in 2003 to $22.4 billion in 2012.
Our investment cooperation is growing at a good pace too. Russian investments in Kazakhstan came to around $1 billion over the first half of 2013, which represents a 40 percent increase compared to the same period in 2012. To build on and multiply this good dynamic, we now need to develop our interregional and border-region cooperation in such a way as to prepare for a more advanced integration model, given that we plan to launch the Eurasian Economic Union at the start of 2015. 
In this context, the theme chosen for this year’s forum – Developing Industrial Cooperation – makes perfect sense. Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus together comprise a common market with free movement of capital, goods, services and labour. It is only logical that we should develop technological and industrial alliances. We discussed this earlier at the meeting in narrow format. We need to establish optimal production chains that will integrate dozens if not hundreds of businesses. The Customs Union and Common Economic Space have already made it possible to remove many obstacles to mutually advantageous cooperation, especially in the machine-building sector. 
I remind you that at the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council’s meeting in Minsk on October 24, together with my colleagues, the presidents of Kazakhstan and Belarus, we agreed to remove the remaining exceptions and limitations within the Customs Union and Common Economic Space frameworks. We hope that these measures will help the three countries to continue on the path of stable economic growth.
Our GDP increased by 1.7 percent over the first half of 2013. Trade within the Customs Union and Common Economic Space grew by 2 percent over the January-August period. Certainly, carrying out this kind of integration by opening our markets to each other is always a complicated process, especially at the initial stages. Trade imbalances and losses do arise. This is only natural and it happens with all integration projects of this kind, but the long-term, systemic benefits of integration outweigh these problems. Business, for example, has already seen the benefits of simplified customs procedures and competition between our countries. Now, each of our countries is trying to create the most attractive conditions for work and for developing business.
The number of Russian-Kazakhstani joint ventures continues to grow steadily and now comes to more than 5,000. These companies work in practically all key sectors, from raw materials extraction and processing to information technology. More than 40 exchange visits by business delegations and 55 specialised exhibitions took place over the first nine months of this year alone.
One of the most promising projects we have is organising the assembly and servicing of Russian helicopters in Kazakhstan and supplying them to Almaty’s city rescue services. We are setting up joint production of medicines at the Karaganda Pharmaceuticals Plant. Uralvagonzavod plans to build a new facility in Kazakhstan to manufacture engines for rolling stock. Work continues on the projects that we discussed at the last interregional forum in Pavlodar. Those projects include building motor vehicle assembly plants and service centres with the involvement of Russian automotive industry companies: AvtoVAZ, Sollers, Kamaz and GAZ.
I am sure that this deep-reaching industrial cooperation in different sectors will make our economic relations more robust and help us to balance out the impact of fluctuations on world markets.
Colleagues, it is tradition at the Forum to sign a package of intergovernmental and interregional agreements. It is symbolic that at this tenth anniversary meeting we have prepared for signing a new basic agreement – the Agreement on Good-Neighbourliness and Alliance in the 21st Century. It lays the foundations for continued development of our strategic partnership over the coming decades.
Thank you for your attention.

The two presidents made press statements.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, ladies and gentlemen,
As in past years, the atmosphere at this 10th anniversary Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum was business-like and constructive. First during the meeting with President of Kazakhstan Mr Nazarbayev, and then at the plenary session, we discussed the most topical matters concerning our multifaceted partnership.
The Interregional Cooperation Forum has been held every year since 2003 and plays a major part in developing bilateral cooperation at the practical level. The Forum has examined issues such as developing regions’ transit transport potential and strengthening ties in the energy sector, sustainable economic development and high technology.

We have had an excellent trade and economic dynamic over the recent years, and this has continued this year. Our bilateral trade grew by 15 percent, reaching $18 billion, over the first nine months of this year. Last year, we had trade worth $22.4 billion for the whole year. This year, judging by preliminary results, the figure will be even higher.
We discussed how to maintain these positive trends and what we can do to further stimulate industrial cooperation. We talked about concrete means for achieving these objectives. Everyone taking part in the Forum, whether members of our governments or heads of the Russian and Kazakhstani regions, all agree that we must make maximum use of the advantages offered by Eurasian integration. The removal of trade barriers through the Customs Union and Common Economic Space is already having a noticeable impact on developing bilateral industrial ties and the economy in general.
The launch of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015 will open up even greater opportunities for carrying out interregional initiatives. We will establish qualitatively new conditions for developing technology, production and investment alliances between Russia and Kazakhstan. I am sure that deeper integration will lead to the creation of new jobs. Greater competition and a higher quality of goods and services will have a positive impact on our peoples’ lives.
We have just signed agreements that will take us further in this direction and bring us closer to achieving our goals. I particularly note the Agreement on Good-Neighbourliness and Alliance in the 21st Century. It cements the principles for our strategic partnership for the decades to come.
I note too that in parallel with the Forum, the bilateral Business Council on Border-Region Cooperation also met, and an exhibition on industrial cooperation between our regions took place. The first Youth Forum was held with success. It discussed opportunities for expanding our science and technology ties and humanitarian and education contacts.
Summing up, we should highlight that the meeting in Yekaterinburg once again showed the city’s ability to organise international events at the highest level, and I want to thank our colleagues from Yekaterinburg for this.
In conclusion, I want to thank everyone who took part in the Forum for productive work and for achieving today’s results. 
Thank you very much for your attention.
President of Kazakhtan Nursultan Nazarbayev: Mr Putin,
I would like to thank you for the invitation to visit Yekaterinburg and for creating excellent conditions for this Forum. We initiated this Forum ten years ago; it has demonstrated its usefulness in these years and become an important element in the cooperation between our nations. I think Russia and Kazakhstan have done the most in the post-Soviet space to maintain relations between people, industries, and our nations’ economies.
We are neighbours. Neighbours are not chosen, they are given to us by God. That is how our forefathers lived, that is how we live, and that is how our descendants will live. It is best to strengthen relations and build the foundation for future cooperation. In this regard, the Forum is a very important stimulus. Mr Putin has talked about this in detail.
The growth in trade between our nations, the increase in communication between our peoples, the creation of joint companies both in Kazakhstan and in Russia, and mutual supplies of goods – all this helps us stay afloat in the global competition.
Entering the World Trade Organisation, we must first build up our competitiveness here, on the inside. That is why we created the Customs Union of Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. In its two years of work, it has demonstrated its efficacy and we are confidently moving towards the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union – the very highest level of integration in the post-Soviet space. We want to prove its efficacy, equality, and advantageousness for all states.
We have been operating in accordance with the 1992 Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. Now, we have renewed it under new conditions and adopted a new, very important, fundamental agreement for all of our work. The fact that we held the Youth Forum and had an industry exposition helps us gain experience and work together.
I think that the Forum in Yekaterinburg was very successful and will contribute to expanding relations, trade and other forms of cooperation between our economies, people and cultures, ensuring they serve the good of both our neighbourly, friendly and brotherly nations.
Thank you for your attention.

Russia-Vietnam: Together to New Cooperation Goals
In the run-up to Vladimir Putin’s official visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, an article by the President Russia-Vietnam: Together to New Cooperation Goals has been published in major Vietnamese newspapers.
November 11, 2013
04:00
Ahead of my third visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, I would like to take this opportunity to directly address Vietnamese public and share some thoughts on the future of our bilateral relations.
Russian-Vietnamese friendship has stood the test of time, having lived through the numerous tragic events of the 20th century, drastic changes in the world as well as in our countries. The main thing has always remained the same, however – respect towards each other, traditions of confidence and mutual assistance, ability to appreciate selfless support of the partners that will never betray.
In this context, let me quote famous words of President Ho Chi Minh: ”When you drink water, think of its source.“ I consider that phrase to be a spiritual instruction to the present and future generations of citizens of our countries. One should always remember our common history and everything that unites us. This guarantees continuity and stability of future-oriented relations.
We are happy with major achievements reached by Vietnam on its path towards important economic and social reforms. Russia addresses complex national issues as well. We believe that active involvement in the integration processes, both at global and regional levels, is a powerful resource for development. We attach particular importance to cooperation with the Asia Pacific States among which Vietnam is one of the leading centers of growth.
The positions of our countries on issues relating to the global agenda are similar in many aspects. Together we seek answers to new challenges and threats. We uphold the rule of law in international relations and advocate that no alternative political or diplomatic tools should be used for resolving disputes and that every state has a right to choose it own path of development.
All these factors determine the intensity of Russian-Vietnamese strategic partnership which we can rightly call comprehensive. Last year, bilateral trade increased by 20 percent and amounted to $3.66 billion. We expect that it will reach $7 billion as early as 2015 and increase up to $10 billion in 2020.
The signing of a free trade area agreement (FTA) between the member states of the Customs Unions
and Vietnam would contribute to achieving these objectives, which corresponds to the logic of political and economic integration in Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific region. The negotiations on a FTA are under way, and we hope to successfully complete them.
Energy, oil and gas sectors have traditionally played a key role in the development of Russian-Vietnamese industrial and investment cooperation. For instance, our leading joint venture Vietsovpetro has accumulated a unique technological expertise of working on the continental shelf. Over the years, the company has produced 206 million tons of oil and its total profits account for tens of billions of dollars.
The companies Rosneft and Gazprom increase their presence in Vietnam. Their projects relate to the production of hydrocarbons, modernization of refining capacities and supply to Vietnam of the liquefied natural gas from the Russian Far East.
Let me emphasize that our oil and gas cooperation is two-way and reciprocal. Rusvietpetro is an example of a successful joint venture in the Nenets autonomous district. We also expect a lot of another joint company Gazpromviet which has started the development of oil and gas fields in the Orenburg region and other Russian territories.
Our cooperation in energy goes far beyond hydrocarbon production. Russia helps Vietnam to develop a nuclear industry which is a totally new sector for the country. Rosatom will be responsible for the construction of the first Vietnamese nuclear power plant in the province of Ninh Thuan. The first and second nuclear units are scheduled to be launched in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Plans are being discussed to jointly construct a Nuclear Science & Technology Center.
Peaceful use of outer space and Russia's GLONASS
satellite navigation system, air and rail transportation development, engineering, mining, banking and public health seem to be very promising areas of cooperation. The goal of the above projects and initiatives is to improve our investment, technology and industrial collaboration.
Our military and technical cooperation has taken a totally new dimension. It is no longer limited to export supplies, steps are being taken to launch in Vietnam licensed production of advanced military equipment with the assistance of Russian companies.
We have always been proud of the traditions of humanitarian cooperation in the field of education, science and culture. It is meaningful that this year Vietnam has been allocated the highest quota (except for the CIS
countries) for training specialists in Russian educational institutions. Today about 5,000 citizens of Vietnam receive education in Russia, about 2000 of them study under interstate agreements.
I should underline the joint activities of our scientists, including many years of work of the Russian-Vietnamese Tropical research and technological center. Specialists all over the world highly appreciate the results of its applied and fundamental research.
My visit takes place during the Days of Russian culture in Vietnam. We are pleased to see that our Vietnamese friends are truly interested in our art. On their turn Russian citizens are waiting for the Vietnamese cultural workers to come to visit Russia. I am sure that the Days of Hanoi in Moscow in late November this year will have great success. Such exchanges have already proved their importance. We intend to continue this practice.
The number of Russians visiting Vietnam shows the willingness to learn better rich history and culture of the Vietnamese people. Last year this number doubled and for nine months of this year it has grown up by 66 per cent having risen beyond 200,000 people. I think that this tendency will continue taking into account the successful development of tourist infrastructure in Vietnam.
It is difficult to enumerate the areas in which Russia and Vietnam do not develop fruitful cooperation. I expect that the future high-level negotiations in Hanoi will be constructive as usual and will give new momentum to the strategic partnership between our states and peoples.
