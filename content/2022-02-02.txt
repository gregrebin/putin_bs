President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Our agenda today includes a subject that we are constantly addressing in one way or another at different levels. It directly concerns the introduction of modern technologies as well as some related, occasionally complicated phenomena that need to be resolved in a timely manner in order to protect the security of both certain industries and individuals. Today, we will discuss how to improve the protection of personal data of Russian Federation citizens in the course of introducing digital technologies.
We will hear today from Mr Maksut Shadayev, Minister of Digital Development. I would like to ask him to begin the meeting.
Please, you have the floor.
