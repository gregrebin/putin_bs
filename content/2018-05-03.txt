Meeting with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Infantino,
Together we attended one of the meetings with our colleagues who are engaged in preparations for the World Cup.
I would like to thank you for the high marks you gave to our work so far to prepare for the championship. But I want to assure you that we understand our responsibility, we understand that more needs to be done. The big event is still a way off.

I hope that together, as you just said, together with you, with your team, we will manage to hold this championship at the highest level. In any case, we will do our best to make it so.
Then, as I already told you, it is important for us that the World Cup leave behind a very positive, great legacy: facilities, buildings, infrastructure, logistics and children’s sports. Today we already had an opportunity to talk about this; we need to make a push in the development of children’s sports.
So, a great deal of work – but positive and interesting work – still lies ahead.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino: Spasibo. Thank you, Mr President. It has been for me a great pleasure and honour to participate in this meeting today.
I have been witnessing with my own eyes that we are ready for the final sprint. Forty-two days to go. The adrenalin is starting to come up. The whole world is focusing more and more on Russia. And Russia is ready to welcome the whole world, to celebrate this summer here in Russia.
What has been done in Russia in the preparation for this World Cup, with the stadiums, the infrastructure, the airports, the hotels, but also and in particular, for welcoming of the fans from all over the world, is absolutely unique. The fans from all over the world who will come to Russia, and there will be many hundreds of thousands of fans, they will experience a summer of joy, a summer of celebration, a summer of holiday together with the people of Russia. And this is possible only thanks to the commitment, dedication and professionalism of the Russian Government, starting from the President to each and every single citizen of Russia.
So, we cannot wait for the kick-off of the World Cup. And we know that we are all together ready to make this the best World Cup. Thank you. Spasibo.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
