President Vladimir Putin: I want to congratulate our Indian partners on the clear progress that was achieved by Indian scientists and the industry of India during joint work in creating modern rocket technology. This is a good basis not just to develop the most modern and effective defence systems, but also to develop rocket technology, which we will use together in the future for our joint programmes in space research. And furthermore, this is an area that stimulates many other areas of this technology. All this is the result of special relations between India and Russia that have formed in recent years.
