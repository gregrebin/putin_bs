President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Churov, members of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, colleagues,
I came here not only to take part in the ceremony as the person heading the United Russia federal list but also to emphasise that the election legislation, the law on elections, applies to everyone, including the President of the Russian Federation and all state officials, and everyone must follow the law on equal terms. The law on elections, which governs the organisation of the State Duma elections, is dictated by the main provisions of our Constitution and must be strictly observed during the voting.
The United Russia party enjoys considerable support among the electorate. The main struggle lies ahead: all the parliamentary parties have been registered and our non-parliamentary parties are still collecting votes to be registered. In any case, the strongest party will win, and I am confident that the State Duma elections will be held at the highest level and will show the interest of the Russian public in making our political system and, therefore, our life more modern and more interesting.
Thank you.
