Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, comrades,
I congratulate you on the successful completion of the special operation in Dagestan.
You have demonstrated once again, in a convincing manner, that our armed forces, secret services and law-enforcement agencies can work professionally and effectively, as a well-coordinated team.
You have made a weighty contribution to establishing constitutional order in our country, in the Caucasus, and a serious contribution to efforts against international terrorism.
Please accept my thanks and congratulations.
