President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Dyumin, friends,
Mr Dyumin, you and I have agreed to talk about the development of the region today, the development of the Tula Region.
I see that you propose having a somewhat unusual meeting with a regional head: you have invited your colleagues from various sectors.
I think this is very good and timely, and I hope it will be interesting to listen not only to the Governor of the Tula Region but also to the people working in vital activity areas, who have direct contact with and feedback from the people.
Let’s begin. The topic is a common one: the socioeconomic situation and plans for the development of the Tula Region.

Speaking on the socio-economic situation in the region, Tula Region Governor Alexei Dyumin told the President about the reconstruction of Tula’s historical centre. As part of the national project on creating a comfortable urban environment, the region has improved 1,300 site, 1,165 courtyards and 111 public spaces. Twenty-two parks and 22 squares have received a new lease of life. Eleven historical townships received large-scale reconstruction. People are being relocated from dilapidated housing; about 1,500 residents have received new flats. Over 3,500 people will receive new housing before the end of 2023. The housing programme is being funded by the federal and regional governments.
According to the Governor, over 700 billion rubles have been attracted to the Tula Region since 2016. The region is carrying out over 60 large investment projects. The defence, chemical and metals industries have been and remain the foundation of the region’s economy. Mr Dyumin recalled that Russia’s biggest chemical companies are located in the compact Tula Region, Shchekinoazot, for example. This company is implementing many new investment projects. Upon their completion, it will become the leader in methanol production in Russia and Europe.
The Governor also spoke about environmental protection. The region is upgrading manufacturing while using eco-friendly methods, building water treatment facilities, and creating a large monitoring system throughout its territory. In signing agreements on new investment projects, it adheres to environmental standards as one of the main terms in the agreement.
Mr Dyumin also noted that there are some issues that require support from the President and financial assistance from the federal centre. These issues are briefly outlined in a letter to the President, and include the environment, road infrastructure, improvement of the healthcare system, and the further development of the successful special economic zone. The Governor asked the President to review and support these programmes, if possible.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
Indeed, one of the issues you mentioned has traditionally been an urgent one. Unfortunately, this situation has become traditional over decades; I am referring to dilapidated housing. This is probably the most pressing issue in the country’s central regions. It must be resolved systematically, so we will work on it together.
As for the other issues, Tula’s Eastern Bypass, water treatment facilities, ambulances, and the special economic zone, I have all the documents on them and they will certainly be sent to the Government with the relevant resolutions. You know how to do this – to work with the Government, so I hope this will be completed. You understand that it is simply necessary to study each document at the relevant department.
Thank you for organizing today’s meeting in such an informal atmosphere. I was very pleased to see and talk to the people who deal with specific major areas of activity and to understand their attitude to what is really taking place locally.
Thank you very much.
Good luck to you, I wish you all the best.
