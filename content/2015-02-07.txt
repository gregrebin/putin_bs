President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, I am very happy to see you.
Kyrgyzstan is one of our strategic partners in Central Asia. We are happy to state that our trade turnover is growing and Russia is becoming an important trade partner for Kyrgyzstan, accounting for 27 percent.
We have a number of issues to discuss; we meet regularly. Contacts between our states both at Government level and at the top level are regular; we adjust our cooperation. I hope our meeting today will serve the same purpose. We will see where we stand in terms of developing our relations in various areas and will adjust things if necessary.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: The feeling is mutual, Mr Putin. I am also very happy to see you. I also believe that our relations will only grow in the future. We are now in the process of joining the Eurasian Economic Union
.
I think it is a good thing we are meeting today, on this memorable day. I remember that exactly a year ago we watched the opening of the Olympics. It was an outstanding event; I had never seen anything like it. I hope many more such triumphs lie ahead for Russia.
Vladimir Putin: We will watch today’s ice show together. Now we can discuss our current affairs. Later (I believe you have set aside some time) we will go to see the show, and after that we will come back and continue our conversation.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
Exactly one year ago we lit the Olympic flame here in Sochi – the main sports event of the year.
For Russia, the XXII Olympics and the XI Paralympics were very special. It was the first time we hosted the Winter Olympics. For us it was a matter of honour to conduct the Games at the highest possible level and to show the beauty and diversity of this country, its hospitality and openness to the world.
It took us almost seven years to prepare for the Olympics, the entire nation worked hard, all together. We not only built great sports facilities, but also transformed the entire region, turning greater Sochi into a modern resort, a major world-class sports hub.
The Olympic heritage, the potential left behind is truly unprecedented. This was made possible by all those who took part in this work.
Suffice it to say that this winter holiday season in Sochi was record-breaking. Hundreds of thousands of people discovered active recreation, sports and holidaymaking in Russia.
Today I would like once again to thank all those who took part in preparing and conducting the Olympic Games: construction workers, organisers, journalists, volunteers and, of course, our wonderful athletes, who crowned our Olympic project.
When it was all just beginning, I visited the sites that were to become sports facilities and the simple question kept coming to my head “Will we really do it?” Later, after it was all over, I had another question “Did we really do it?” Yes, we did it, the entire country, all of Russia did it. However, we should not stop here, we should move on, in the spirit of the Olympic motto “Higher, faster, stronger!”
Thank you.
