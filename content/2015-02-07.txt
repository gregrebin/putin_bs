President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Atambayev, I am very happy to see you.
Kyrgyzstan is one of our strategic partners in Central Asia. We are happy to state that our trade turnover is growing and Russia is becoming an important trade partner for Kyrgyzstan, accounting for 27 percent.
We have a number of issues to discuss; we meet regularly. Contacts between our states both at Government level and at the top level are regular; we adjust our cooperation. I hope our meeting today will serve the same purpose. We will see where we stand in terms of developing our relations in various areas and will adjust things if necessary.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev
: The feeling is mutual, Mr Putin. I am also very happy to see you. I also believe that our relations will only grow in the future. We are now in the process of joining the Eurasian Economic Union
.
I think it is a good thing we are meeting today, on this memorable day. I remember that exactly a year ago we watched the opening of the Olympics. It was an outstanding event; I had never seen anything like it. I hope many more such triumphs lie ahead for Russia.
Vladimir Putin: We will watch today’s ice show together. Now we can discuss our current affairs. Later (I believe you have set aside some time) we will go to see the show, and after that we will come back and continue our conversation.
