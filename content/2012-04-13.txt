Meeting on healthcare issues.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Colleagues,
Continuing the series of meetings on preparing and discussing the Strategy 2020 national social and economic development concept, we are here today to look at the healthcare system. I will not speak for long because the aim of meetings such as this is not to listen to speeches by the country’s leaders, but for me to hear what you have to say.
We have already worked out policy approaches and drawn up the roadmap for legislative changes in the healthcare and health insurance sectors. We will hear a report on this today. A timetable of measures has been set for each year of the programme. But we need to discuss other possible options too, and simply exchange views on the main aspects of the roadmap’s implementation and the implementation of that part of the Strategy 2020 concept devoted to healthcare.
I will not speak about our achievements now; everyone knows the results we have achieved in demographics and other areas. Our healthcare system still has many problems. We are aware of them, and are aware of the how many problems they cause for our citizens. Let us discuss all of these things now.
