President Vladimir Putin: I am very happy to see you here in Moscow and have the pleasure of receiving you in our capital. I remember the warmth with which our Saudi friends and the King received me in Saudi Arabia. Please pass on my very best wishes to His Majesty King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
I know that you have a very full programme here in Moscow, a programme that covers humanitarian cooperation, economic ties and military-technical cooperation. I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you to discuss issues on the international agenda, above all issues affecting the situation in the region, of course.
We are very pleased to see you, your Majesty!
Welcome to Moscow!
Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud: I would like to say, Your Excellency, how happy we are to have this meeting with the leader of a country we consider to be a friend.
I would like to note that our bilateral relations are characterised by a spirit of trust and have good prospects ahead. I am very pleased with the meetings I had yesterday and this morning with my Russian colleagues. They took place in a very warm atmosphere.
