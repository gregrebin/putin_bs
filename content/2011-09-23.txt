President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon, colleagues.
We have several items on the agenda today, but before turning to today’s subjects of discussion, I want to inform you that I am submitting to the State Duma a draft law to make state administration more effective in terms of preventing corruption. This – namely, the proposal to broaden the grounds on which civil servants can be fired, including for loss of confidence — was one of the issues I addressed at the St Petersburg Economic Forum.
It also clarifies civil law provisions so as to make it possible to take retrospective action against investigative officials in cases where they have unlawfully pressed administrative or criminal charges against an individual and are responsible for damages caused to the individual in question. This will give an additional guarantee against unlawful prosecution.
This draft law also makes some other significant innovations to our anticorruption provisions. I hope it will be examined and passed swiftly because it really is an important document. Ms Matviyenko [Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko], I draw this to your attention.
