President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
Today is the day when the entire country, all Russian regions mark a special day – All-Russian Student Graduation Day. And, of course, first of all, I would like to congratulate you, young professionals, who have just defended your graduation papers, from the bottom of my heart on successfully completing your studies at higher education institutions and universities.
Your bright and unforgettable student years are becoming history, and you are entering an entirely new stage when much or virtually everything will depend on you yourselves, when you will set your own tasks, determine the scale of your future achievements, and I am confident that you will be able to accomplish a lot.
This year, the Year of Science and Technology, Student Graduation Day is taking place under the motto With Science in Heart. In a modern world, it is extremely important to constantly search for and obtain new knowledge and skills, to be always aware of the most advanced solutions in your professional spheres, to be able to introduce and use them; and this concerns virtually all careers.
I have no doubts that you are determined, serious and success-minded young people, and that you are absolutely prepared for this continuous educational challenge. It goes without saying that you and your generation perceive the value of knowledge and personal improvement. We will therefore continue to develop systems and platforms capable of facilitating your professional growth, supporting your ideas and initiatives, including public and volunteer initiatives.
I would like to wish all of you every success in finding your own unique way and your true calling. Yes, this does not always happen right away, at the first try. But the most important thing here is not to give up, and you will then certainly find a career that will completely unlock your knowledge, abilities and the best human qualities. You will be completely proud of these careers because they benefit people and will serve the whole of Russia.
I would like to thank your mentors and tutors separately, to thank all professors and lecturers for their tremendous and highly significant work in the interests of our state’s future.
I hope that you, just like many millions of our compatriots, will remain sincerely grateful to your educators, that you will respect them all your life, and that you will sincerely preserve and cherish your student friendship.
Please persevere and study all the time and never stop dreaming. Today, all roads and opportunities are open before you in Russia. I believe in your future victories.
Good luck to you all!
