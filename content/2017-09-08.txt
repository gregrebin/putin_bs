Meeting with representatives of Perm Territory information and communications cluster.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, colleagues.
As you may be aware, we have been talking a lot recently, and not just talking, but trying to do more, as you may have noticed, in the high-tech industry, information technology, and other such spheres. We adopted a strategy for developing a digital society, and a plan for developing a digital economy.
With regard to Perm, how did you manage to get this far? Perm has always been primarily a major industrial centre for the fuel and energy sector, engineering, the metallurgical industry, including both ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, and the processing industry. Of course, large companies, such as the one run by Andrei Kuzyaev, ER-Telecom, can be the drivers behind this movement. This company has become Russiaâ€™s second largest in terms of the number of clients among internet providers and cable television operators. It is nothing short of great.
What we saw here is impressive as well. The way our colleagues spoke, the interest they have in their work, and their enthusiasm and professionalism, are truly impressive.
Let us talk about what you do here. I would like to hear what you think about the developments in the regulatory framework which is designed to further expand your field of activity, and what may still be lacking. Let us have a free and open discussion, without any restrictions.
To be continued.
