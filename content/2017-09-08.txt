Meeting with representatives of Perm Territory information and communications cluster.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, colleagues.
As you may be aware, we have been talking a lot recently, and not just talking, but trying to do more, as you may have noticed, in the high-tech industry, information technology, and other such spheres. We adopted a strategy for developing a digital society, and a plan for developing a digital economy.
With regard to Perm, how did you manage to get this far? Perm has always been primarily a major industrial centre for the fuel and energy sector, engineering, the metallurgical industry, including both ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, and the processing industry. Of course, large companies, such as the one run by Andrei Kuzyaev, ER-Telecom, can be the drivers behind this movement. This company has become Russia’s second largest in terms of the number of clients among internet providers and cable television operators. It is nothing short of great.
What we saw here is impressive as well. The way our colleagues spoke, the interest they have in their work, and their enthusiasm and professionalism, are truly impressive.
Let us talk about what you do here. I would like to hear what you think about the developments in the regulatory framework which is designed to further expand your field of activity, and what may still be lacking. Let us have a free and open discussion, without any restrictions.
To be continued.

With Acting Governor of Perm Territory Maxim Reshetnikov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Reshetnikov, how much time has passed since you began?
Acting Governor of the Perm Territory Maxim Reshetnikov: Mr President, it has been seven months, fairly intense ones at that. These months have been busy. During this time, I visited all the 48 districts of the Region. I held meetings with local residents in each district in Perm and worked out a development programme. Moreover, the development programme was drawn up based on the questions posed by the residents.
Actually, citizens of the region do not expect anything from the authorities other than what they can and should provide. Therefore, they raised issues concerning health, education, roads, gasification, communications, the internet, promoting sports and jobs, of course. This is exactly what we can and should provide. We developed a programme based on these requests, presented it to the people and discussed it with them.
In each district, I tried to visit a central district hospital, a school, agricultural and industrial enterprises. I spoke to war veterans a lot, because, firstly, they have a lot of energy, and secondly, they have a very clear, sensitive take on things, and are very professional too. It really is a great support. And, of course, I talked a lot with young people.
As a result, a programme was developed, and there is an understanding of what to do. The programme has enough funding for the long term; we analysed everything so as not to make empty promises. And now there is an understanding of what to do, a team is being formed, and I am sure that we are able to provide what people expect from us, from the region, from the authorities.
Vladimir Putin: Mr Reshetnikov, you are local, you know about everything first-hand, both the strengths and weaknesses. There are still a great many issues to be worked out and solved. You and I have just spoken about it.
You are a young man but fairly experienced. You also used to work in the Russian Government. Which department did you work in?
Maxim Reshetnikov: I worked in the Department of State Administration, Regional Development and Local Self-government. It dealt with reforms and inter-budgetary relations.
Vladimir Putin: And that was when I was Prime Minister.
Then you were a Minister in the Moscow Government, which is also considerable experience. It is a megacity of 12 million people. Yet Perm is a special place, a major economic cluster with industry: chemical, petrochemical, you name it, metallurgy. We are now witnessing an IT boom, such interesting professional people; we see how fast it is progressing. There are a lot of things to deal with here, and I would like to wish you success.
Maxim Reshetnikov: Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you for your support and your visit. It matters a lot for the residents here.
