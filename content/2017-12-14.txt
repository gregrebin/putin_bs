President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, comrade officers,
Let me welcome you to the Kremlin’s St George Hall, the hall of Russia’s military glory.
Today we honour Heroes of Russia, Heroes of the Soviet Union and holders of the Order of Glory and the Order of St George. These decorations were established in different times, but the recipients have always been people of iron will, exceptional valour, courage and honour. And Heroes of the Fatherland Day is another symbol of the unbreakable continuity of the traditions of bravery and patriotism.
We pay tribute to the heroic deeds of the defenders of ancient Rus, the heroes of 1812, the First World War and the Great Patriotic War as well as those who fought in hot spots. We are proud of those who protect Russia and provide security to our citizens today.
This is exactly how Russian military personnel have acted in Syria – bravely, meticulously and professionally. They have done their duty, destroying a large organised terrorist group together with the Syrian army, and now a path is opening up to resolve the Syrian conflict politically and to restore the country so that hundreds of thousands of people will be able to live peacefully again.
Comrades,
Sincere love for the homeland has always animated our people’s spirit. It has helped us overcome all obstacles and inspired heroic deeds and loyal service to Fatherland and the Russian people. Russia’s thousand-year history is based on such acts, on the moral choice of each man and woman.
I would like to thank all those here today, as well as those who are not here but share in this holiday and do their duty with valour and courage. Like our great ancestors, you show us with your own example that such values as chivalry, selflessness and loyalty to the Fatherland will always remain important and secure Russia’s strength and greatness.
I congratulate you once again on this holiday, Heroes of the Fatherland Day. I wish you good health, success and all the best to you and your families.
I would like to propose a toast. Here is to the Heroes of the Fatherland! Here is to our great Fatherland, to Russia!

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
I would like to congratulate all of you on the 60th anniversary of the Military-Industrial Commission, above all the veteran members, who devoted years of their lives, their talent and inspiration to this work of crucial importance for the country. I hope very much that the current personnel will carry on the work the veterans did. I see very young people here who have as much talent and are as devoted to their job and the country as the veterans. This is what we need now and always will. You can see that your work has not lost its importance, which is quite high and even singular for a country such as Russia.
We do not need this to threaten anyone with the products of our defence industry, but to live peacefully, confidently and decently, without having to look around in fear of what might happen to us any second. It is a relief that this is not the situation, and I hope that it never will be, thanks to you and your colleagues at your companies.
Of course, it is very important to set your minds to working as we have planned, so that civilian and dual-purpose products constitute at least 50 percent of your output. We need to make the best of the opportunities offered by the modernisation of the defence sector, in which we have invested quite a lot of money, more precisely, 3 trillion rubles. This money must be used not only to maintain our defence capabilities but also to win the domestic and foreign markets of high-tech civilian products.
Once again, I congratulate you on this event and wish you every success.
Remark: Thank you. The veterans have not stopped working. We will do a lot of good things yet under your guidance.
Vladimir Putin: I have no doubt. Thank you very much.
