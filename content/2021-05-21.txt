President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.
Before we start our meeting, our work, I would like to congratulate Mr Shoigu on a double holiday: his birthday and the birthday of the Pacific Fleet. True, it seems like the Pacific Fleet is a bit older, I think 290 years old, but accept my greetings as Defence Minister.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Thank you, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: I would like to wish you all the best. I also wish the sailors of the Pacific Fleet fair winds and following seas, and successful service for the benefit of the Fatherland.
The Pacific sailors are always in the front ranks; they master the latest equipment, and I am sure they will perform the tasks set them by Russia in a befitting manner.
And to you, as the Defence Minister, I would like to wish not only health but also success in your career. I wish you all the best.
