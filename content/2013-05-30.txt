With International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, allow me to warmly welcome you once again to St Petersburg and to Russia.
We are very pleased that you chose St Petersburg to host a regular meeting of the well-known and highly respected organisation SportAccord.
And we have another good opportunity to inform you about how preparations for the 2014 Olympic Games are proceeding.
I am very glad to see you, once again: welcome.
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge: Mr President, thank you very much for the great hospitality that we are experiencing here in St Petersburg.
This is one more sign of the great support of the Russian Federation to the world of sport and the Olympic movement. And we will soon be back for the Athletics World Championships in Moscow in a couple of weeks time.
We are very pleased with the progress of preparations in Sochi. And we believe we are going to have fantastic Olympic Games.
Thank you.
