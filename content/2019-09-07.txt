President of Russian Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev, thank you for coming to Russia on this festive day, especially since it is the opening of your pavilion at VDNKh.
There is no need to stress again that to a large extent you are the builder of Russia-Kazakhstan relations, which have attained an unprecedented high level of alliance in the humanitarian, military areas, military technical cooperation. In fact, there are no areas where we have not achieved impressive results.
We are always glad to see you, and I am pleased that our personal contacts are continuing.
Welcome.
Nursultan Nazarbayev: Thank you, Mr President, for the invitation to attend Moscow City Day celebrations.
Moscow is a city that is in all our hearts. We have been visiting it since our youth, we studied, worked, and took part in all the events. Coming to Moscow is always a pleasure, especially now. And the exhibition of the national economy has also been with us since our youth.
Our lives are spent together, and people’s friendship turns into a huge power. It is especially good to say ahead of the 75th anniversary of Victory that the real winner in that terrible war was the friendship of all peoples living in the Soviet Union. We are the sons of the fathers who were victors, and this is why we live the way we do.
I think we are the only generation in many centuries that was born and grew up without a war. This is a result of our parents’ selfless efforts and their struggle.
Kazakhstan-Russia relations are ideal, one can say, they are an example for all other nations. I did my best for this to happen and I hope it will be continued. I am watching over it because, firstly, it is advantageous for Kazakhstan. Secondly, it is necessary for all of us.
The Eurasian Economic Union, which we worked so hard to bring into being and to build up, is functioning and developing against all odds, and benefits all our nations.
This is why we have some matters to discuss even though I am not the President any more – I am the first President, the former President, the leader of the nation with certain duties, and I keep strengthening our state, helping my successors to carry on what I launched and founded.
I see how hard you work, Mr President, very hard. Yesterday you were in Vladivostok, here today and tomorrow somewhere else. Foreign visits and negotiations are very demanding, so you need good health. This is what I wish you with all my heart.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
Nursultan Nazarbayev: I wish you good health, success to Russia, overcoming all hardships, and it will definitely happen, it has always happened. And all the very best to you.
Thank you again for the opportunity to meet with you personally in the Kremlin.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.

Speech at Moscow City Day celebrations
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear Muscovites and city guests, Mr Sobyanin,
My most sincere greetings to you on City Day.
This year, the main celebrations are taking place at the legendary VDNKh exhibition centre, which has recently marked its 80th anniversary.
Expansive reconstruction is underway here. We see the renewal of the splendid and eye-catching image of VDNKh, as well as the results of careful and respectful efforts to restore the exhibition's architectural and historic landmarks.
VDNKh is successfully bringing back its key mission of being the largest expo, museum, cultural, educational and public space, and proves Moscow's enduring importance as a creative and unifying centre.
This role, which defines Moscow's prominence, is a key one in its centuries-long history, as well as in creating and developing the Russian state and strengthening our multi-ethnic nation.
Today, Moscow is not only a modern megalopolis and the capital of our country; the city is justly Russia's heritage and a unique reflection of all its eras and the deep, generous spirit. The city has gained respect of our country's residents with its beauty and achievements.
Our capital cherishes the memory of its roots, its heroes and enthusiasts, and its many generations that became a cherished and essential part of the city. And this is a city that always looks into the future, with its exciting, busy and often rather tough rhythm.
But Moscow is also a hospitable city, which opens vast opportunities for self-fulfilment, rejects indifference and inertia, demands constant advancement and efforts to explore new things, and full commitment of those who live and work here.
We see how the city has changed over the past few years – this is an obvious fact. We see how much has been done to create an efficient business environment, social, transport and digital infrastructure, and a comfortable public space.
With its huge size, the metropolis has enough problems. But much effort has been taken [in this regard] in all Moscow districts, each of which is the size of a large European city.
All Moscow streets, public gardens, avenues and spots are very different, yet they combine in harmony and complement each other, merging to form a unique and inimitable image of Moscow, the city we love and rightfully feel proud of.
I would like to thank Moscow Mayor Mr Sobyanin and all Muscovites for their efficient joint efforts and commitment to tackling the hardest challenges and achieving high goals of modern times.
Way to go, dear Muscovites! Happy City Day! I wish Moscow and all our country success and prosperity.
Thank you.
