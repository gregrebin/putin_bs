President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon again, colleagues.
It is Mr Slyusar’s birthday. Many happy returns, one more event today.
We have just attended the opening of the 15th International Aviation and Space Salon, toured some of the exhibits, seen new products from the Russian aviation industry, and talked with designers and manufacturers. As a matter of fact, some of our colleagues are also taking part in this meeting today, people actually working in the industry.
Let's discuss how the key projects in civil aircraft engineering are being implemented and review the comprehensive plan for the industry’s development until 2030.
We will consider factors that will shape the demand for aircraft in the next decade, the growth prospects for production capacity, and we will see how the corresponding part of the state order is progressing in this context.
For Russia, with its vast territory, civil aircraft engineering has always been and will always be one of the undisputed priorities, because this industry’s efficiency is key to various regions’ transport accessibility and connectivity, to greater passenger and cargo traffic, people’s mobility, Russia’s higher export potential, and of course, the stability of our aviation enterprises, research institutes and design bureaus that employ over 400,000 highly qualified specialists.
All these years, we focused on modernising the aviation industry, increasing its funding and making its products more competitive. We always focused on promoting priority civilian aircraft projects, primarily modern airliners. We are seeing them today: the MC-21 medium-haul airliner, the Sukhoi Superjet-100, the Ilyushin Il-114, L-410, the Baikal light multipurpose aircraft, as well as the Kamov Ka-62, Mil Mi-38, and Ansat helicopters.
Today, I would like to ask you to tell us about the certification of these aircraft, beginning of deliveries, production plans and the creation of a system of after-sales service.
I would like to repeat that it is important to ensure the stable and sustained operation of aircraft enterprises, especially as we continue dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic.
We held a meeting on aviation industry development in May 2020 for this, and we adopted additional measures for supporting the sector. The goal was to facilitate demand for Russian-made aircraft, including through state guarantees for the purchase of 59 Sukhoi Superjet-100 airliners and subsidies for reducing flight-hour maintenance costs, as well as the provision of state guarantees for the purchase of 66 Russian-made helicopters for the emergency airlift service.
Today, we will discuss the implementation of these decisions, review how many planes and helicopters have been purchased through state guarantee mechanisms, and discuss unresolved issues and other matters, if any. 
In addition, at the May meeting, the Government received instructions to draft and approve a programme for a state order for domestic civilian aircraft to 2030. Today, I would like to hear the status of this programme.
Let me repeat, it is necessary to clearly determine the future plans of aircraft producers up to at least 2030, as well as their responsibility for commitments on supply schedules, pricing, quality and servicing the equipment. It is essential to fund these plans properly from various sources. This is also one of the main items on our agenda today.
It is also necessary to draft proposals on supporting Russian-made aircraft sales and follow-up maintenance. This will ensure airline demand for these aircraft.
Of course, it is important to support performance reliability and the proper functionality of this new aircraft fleet, including by maintaining the schedules for the supply of engines and parts.
We have repeatedly talked about the need for this work, and I would like to ask you to report on your results in this important area.
Let’s move on to the discussion of these issues.

Meeting with President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
Vladimir Putin held a meeting in the Kremlin with President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, who is in Russia on a working visit.
July 20, 2021
18:50
The Kremlin, Moscow
With President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Eid Mubarak! Happy holiday [Eid al-Adha]! My congratulations to you. I wish you all the best.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: Thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: We will celebrate a big holiday next year – 30 years of diplomatic relations.
I would like to thank you for coming here. Thank God, we are restoring our relations after the coronavirus. I am referring primarily to the economy. Last year we saw a decline, and now we have confident growth, a recovery.
Russia is confidently in the lead in the economy. Our intergovernmental commission is working actively, there are many areas of cooperation.
We plan to send our representative delegation to your country in the near future. It will deal with these issues in Baku. They meet regularly at various venues. It will be a mixed group covering different spheres, such as industry, transport, infrastructure, some other issues.
We are cooperating in countering the coronavirus and doing so more and more vigorously. I think we have already supplied 100,000 [vaccine doses].
Ilham Aliyev: Even more than that.
Vladimir Putin: We are working on launching joint production in Azerbaijan.
Of course, a settlement in the region remains one of the most important issues. I know that you certainly pay a lot of attention to this important matter, and I would like to thank you for finding compromise solutions in this area. They are always the most complicated ones, but if we want a settlement – and we all want it – we must follow this path. Up to now, we have managed to do this, and I would like to thank you for this.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome.
Ilham Aliyev: Thank you, Mr President. Thank you, first of all, for the invitation. I am also very happy to see you. This is a good opportunity to discuss issues of cooperation once again.
Thank you for your greetings. I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate all Russian Muslims on Eid al-Adha. This is a holiday of solidarity, a holiday of togetherness.
Of course, I fully agree with your assessment of our bilateral agenda. We are moving forward with confidence. Our trade has grown in the first six months of the year. This is very important because last year it dropped by over 10 percent.
We are actively building cooperation in transport and shipping transits. I was told that this year freight volumes on the North-South transport corridor increased 20 percent over last year. So, the corridor is already seeing impressive volume.
I would like to thank you for your assistance in countering the coronavirus. We have received over 200,000 Sputnik V vaccine doses from Russia and we are expecting more. I know that many would like to get this vaccine because it has proven its efficiency. Of course, it is probably very difficult to supply everyone, but we are friends and partners and I would like to thank you again for giving us priority among your vaccine recipients.
I would like to tell you that this year our Baku branch of Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University had its first graduates. This is an important event. Time goes quickly and there are over a thousand students at our two branches – of Moscow and Sechenov universities. More than 15,000 Azerbaijani students study in Russia and 16,000 Azerbaijani students study at the Russian language faculty in Azerbaijan.
So, a large number of Azerbaijani youth is already linked to Russia by language, contacts and education. I think this is very important in transferring our experience to the younger generation.
Of course, there is the issue of the post-conflict situation in the region. I would also like to thank you for your permanent attention to this issue and your personal involvement in resolving vital and sensitive issues. We are always in touch.
I believe in the past eight months after the end of hostilities, our personal contacts – in Moscow in January and by telephone – played a major role in stabilising the situation. We want the post-conflict period to be as painless as possible. I think we are coping with this through a concerted effort.
Thank you for your invitation once again, and now let’s discuss the important issues of cooperation and regional problems.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
