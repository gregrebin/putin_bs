Our relations have very deep roots. You know Russia’s stance on Palestine’s problems and the Palestinian-Israeli settlement. It is a principled stance based on the fundamental resolutions of the United Nations and it remains unchanged.
There is no doubt here; we have always spoken in favour of a just settlement according to international law. In this sense, you can be assured of our position. This is my first point.
The second, of course, is that we are carefully watching what is going on in the region, and I am very happy to meet with you to hear your opinion on the situation.
In our bilateral relations, we have said many times that a lot must still be done for economic ties to develop more actively, and there are necessary prerequisites for this. Our culture and education sector is also well represented. Today I believe 650 Palestinian students are studying in Russia, and we are training them in various areas.
In short, it is a pleasure to see you, Mr President.
President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
I was looking forward to meeting with you. Of course, the coronavirus made it impossible to meet in person for a long time. I am glad that we were able to have telephone conversations once in a while.
It is good that we can hear your news and you can hear ours.
We always and unfailingly believe and know that Russia has a clear position on the settlement, and I am absolutely certain that it will never change. We know perfectly well that Russia stands for justice, for international law. For us, this is a dogma. We also stand for the fact that international law must be respected: this is not what I want; it is a norm that must be respected. We are glad that we have such a partner in Russia.
Of course, I would like to note that we need to intensify the work of the quartet on a settlement. It is necessary to step up its activity in order to help settle the Palestinian problem. We know that it is the quartet that should be doing this, and not someone in particular, for example, the Americans. You know of our position.
We do not want America to single-handedly deal with the solution to the Palestinian problem under any umbrella or pretext. It can be a member of the quartet and play a role there, but we will never accept it monopolising the settlement issue.
Another point that interests us in relation to Russia is the issue of training our students, specialists, including military personnel, and economic cooperation. We are glad that you are giving this due attention.
We are also quite in need of foodstuffs. You know what events are taking place on the global stage, but during our last stay in Russia, we were confident that this issue could be resolved positively. I mean delivering Russian wheat to us from time to time. You are aware of our needs; you know the format of this request. The question is about how to periodically carry out such deliveries. This would only add to our confidence that Russia has a positive attitude towards us and towards the settlement process.

Russia remains one of Azerbaijan’s leading trade and economic partners. Trade is growing steadily – by 14 percent last year, I believe, and by another 7 percent or more in the first seven months of this year. Our economic operators have invested $4.5 billion in the Azerbaijani economy.
The co-chairs of the intergovernmental commission meet on a regular basis, working on joint projects in line with the plan you proposed through 2024, as far as I know. It includes a number of promising and interesting projects that you proposed.
Naturally, we always keep under review the various aspects of the ongoing settlement process in the region. I hope that we will use this opportunity to discuss all these matters again and compare notes.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: I am happy to see you again, Mr Putin.
You are absolutely right; we do meet regularly. We met just recently in St Petersburg, and before that, we met in Samarkand last month. Our relations are progressing so rapidly that, as you have said, we frequently need to compare notes on many issues.
We are very pleased with the way relations between our countries are faring. I would say they have reached the highest level, where we have allied cooperation, and we are making substantial progress on many issues.
You mentioned bilateral trade and economic ties, and I would like to confirm that trade is on the rise between Russia and Azerbaijan. The projects that we have now outlined and agreed on at previous meetings will definitely promote further growth.
We also see positive dynamics in other areas such as transport, energy, and humanitarian cooperation.
And of course, at each of our meetings, we never fail to discuss the issues facing our region, security issues, and ways to achieve peace. We will also talk about this today. We are committed to a long-term peace, and for our part, we believe that we have made a very constructive case for peace to be finally achieved.
Thank you again for this opportunity to meet. I am sure that this meeting will also be very productive.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

,
For a long time, we have been planning to meet in this format and have been coordinating a meeting. Finally, it was organized on the sidelines of today’s event. I would like to thank you for agreeing to talk, to meet in this format.
Of course, we have met before – face to face, one on one and all three. So, this is not something entirely new, but I still think it is important. I would like to note that Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are our close allies. We are working very closely in international organisations and are strategic partners, without question. Suffice it to mention the million Kyrgyz citizens and two million Tajik citizens who live, study and work in the Russian Federation.

We have very close ties in many areas. Our trade is growing. We recorded a roughly 45 percent increase on both sides during the past year, and 20–30 percent in the first seven months of this year. This is trade on a very large scale.
Of course, we are interested in maintaining these conditions, or creating them anew where necessary, for the sake of steady, gradual development.
I am very happy to be meeting in this format.
Thank you once again.

The start of Russian-Qatari talks
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, friends,
We are happy, our delegation is happy to see our Qatari friends. We already started talking about current issues during our working lunch.
I would like to say that I am very happy to see you again. It will be a pleasure to see you in Russia as well, as we agreed.
I would like to begin our conversation by saying that relations between Russia and Qatar are developing successfully. The volume of our mutual trade is not large yet, but there is a notable development trend. Investment activities are underway thanks to your personal involvement. It should be said that they are highly diversified, with investments made in many fields, including such highly-required areas as pharmaceuticals, the production of fertilisers and infrastructure. I think this is very interesting and we will be happy to continue doing this.

We are also doing everything we can in terms of sharing our experience of preparations for the football world championship. You are aware of that, because we had an opportunity to talk about it. I would like to wish you success in hosting this major event. I am sure that this is the way it is going to be.
Your Highness, it is a pleasure to meet you again.
Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to meet today.
As we said during lunch earlier, there are many issues on our bilateral agenda. It can be said that there is a historic connection between our countries.
Qatar has made many investments in the Russian economy, and these investments have not been in vain; they are quite successful. As you pointed out, trade between our countries does not fully meet the standards of our interaction on the political stage, but there is an opportunity to build it up thanks to cooperation in all the spheres, which you have mentioned. There are also good prospects in infrastructure, energy, agriculture and other spheres.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate you on the success Russia achieved during preparations for and the hosting of the world football championship in 2018. It is a major asset for Qatar. Our country is making use of your experience when preparing to host the championship. Thank you very much for your assistance in our preparations for the upcoming tournament. Work is ongoing, and our coordination will continue all the way until the beginning of that sports event.
Mr President, thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you for the excellent organisation and for creating a fan zone for Russian fans.

Beginning of Russia-Turkiye talks
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Erdogan,
Despite the challenges caused by the epidemiological and political restrictions, we still find opportunities to meet and communicate on a regular basis, achieving good results.
I should note that all the agreements reached during your visit to Sochi in August are being implemented. Our colleagues, governments and companies involved in practical action are working to fulfil the plans, including with respect to investment activity and the construction of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant. The work is proceeding according to plan and involves 20,000 people on site. We are meeting the schedule and it looks like we will be able to fulfil the agreements and launch the first energy unit by the centenary of the Republic of Turkiye. Around May 2023, we plan to deliver nuclear fuel, thus completing another stage of this joint project.
As concerns hydrocarbon energy, we deliver our hydrocarbons, including gas, in full and in compliance with your requests. We use transit routes through Turkiye to deliver gas to European countries. Turkiye is currently the most reliable transit country for gas supplies to Europe, thanks to your stance, Mr President, your firm position on the construction of TurkStream. Although, as you may have heard, there were attempts to blow up this gas pipeline on Russian territory. Fortunately, it did not happen and the pipeline continues operation.
At the Russian Energy Week yesterday, after consultations with the Turkish Minister of Energy and CEO of Botas, an agreement was reached with Gazprom. I spoke about this publicly: if Turkiye and potential buyers in other countries are interested, we can consider building another gas pipeline and establishing a gas hub in Turkiye for trade with third countries, first of all European countries, of course, but only if they are interested.

This hub, built by Russia and Turkiye together, would serve as a platform for both supplies and pricing, as pricing is a critical issue these days. The prices today are exorbitant. We would be able to regulate them properly at a market level without any political implications.
We are also working actively in other areas, which is demonstrated by confident growth of trade – both last year and this year. Owing to your efforts, Mr President, we are carrying out a deal on Ukrainian grain exports to foreign markets. I think the recipients of the product should be grateful for this. True, it is unfortunate that the developing, poorest nations are receiving a small portion of it under food programmes but nevertheless, the United Nations is regulating what is available.
In principle, we are implementing all our tentative agreements in other areas.
I am happy to see you again on the sidelines of today’s events.
President of the Republic of Turkiye Recep Tayyip Erdogan
(retranslated): Mr President, I am also happy to see you again here. Using this opportunity, I would like to once again congratulate you on your 70th birthday and wish you a long life.
Since Sochi, we have met here many times. If you go to Samarkand next time, we will have one more opportunity to meet, in Samarkand.
The development of Ro-Ro cargo shipments and the start of Ro-Pax shipments, primarily in the port of Novorossiysk, will certainly boost our relations.
As you noted, the first unit of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant will open in the first half of next year. It will usher in a new era and this will be very good news for the world. I will repeat that if we make other steps, we will receive a multiplied effect.
As for Turkiye-Russia cooperation, the production of energy by Akkuyu will meet 10 percent of our requirements. If a second nuclear power plant is built, it will cover another 10 percent of our requirements. Overall, these two nuclear power plants will meet 20 percent of our energy requirements.
As for another issue – grain and fertiliser – it is necessary to strengthen the Istanbul agreement and to extend it again through Turkiye to make sure, as you said, that Russian fertilisers are delivered to the world’s poorest countries. We are fully resolved to ensure the delivery of grain and fertiliser to less developed countries.
We can work together because we are more concerned about the poor countries than the wealthy states. This is why we should envisage this and if we do it, we will be able to change much, to change the balance in favour of poor countries.
Turkiye and Russia are together. I am sure our steps will worry some circles and some countries but we are full of resolve. Our relevant bodies, our colleagues will establish contacts and conduct meetings. I am referring to our foreign ministers, as well as ministers of agriculture and energy. Their meetings are important and will strengthen our relations.

Speech by the President of Russia at the 6th CICA summit
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President [of Kazakhstan] Kassym-Jomart Tokayev,
Colleagues,
Over the past 30 years, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia has been discussing vital aspects of strengthening security and stability in the vast Asian region.
Today we have met against the backdrop of serious changes in global politics and economy. The world is becoming truly multipolar, and Asia, where new centres of power are growing, is playing a major, if not the key role in this.
Asian countries are drivers of global economic growth. Integration associations, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Eurasian Economic Union, are working dynamically and effectively here.

Russia is actively contributing to these processes. We are committed to the development and prosperity of Asia, to creating an open trade and investment cooperation space and broadening and deepening cooperation ties in various economic sectors towards this end.
I would like to remind you that Russia was a founding country of the CICA Business Council, which has held many successful conferences and seminars on the entire range of economic issues over the past years.
We are working hard together with other Asian counties to create a system of equal and indivisible security based on the universally recognised principles of international law and the UN Charter.
Our Conference and other regional associations are dealing with many pressing issues, notably the increased volatility of global prices of energy, food, fertilisers, raw materials and other essential goods, which is affecting the quality of life in industrialised and developing countries. Moreover, this is creating a real threat of hunger and large-scale social upheavals, especially in the poorest countries.
For its part, Russia is doing its best to supply crucial products to the countries that need them. We call for lifting the artificial and illegal obstacles, which are hindering the revitalisation of the normal operation of global supply chains, in order to be able to address pressing tasks in the field of food security.
Like many of our Asian partners, we believe that it is necessary to start a revision of the operating principles of the global financial system, which for decades allowed the self-proclaimed “golden billion,” which has been using capital and technology flows to its sole advantage, to largely live at others’ expense.
As a priority measure, we believe it is necessary to more actively use national currencies in mutual settlements. These measures would definitely help strengthen the financial sovereignty of our states, develop domestic capital markets and deepen regional economic integration.
It is extremely important to take further action, in cooperation with other regional forums and organisations, to resolve any crises and conflicts occurring in Asia, strengthen cooperation between our states on countering terrorism, expose and neutralise extremist groups, block their financial sources, fight drug trafficking and prevent the propaganda of radical ideas.
Unfortunately, Afghanistan remains one of the biggest security challenges for our region, as my colleagues have already said today.
After more than 20 years of US and NATO military presence and their failing policy, that country turned out to be unable to independently deal with the terrorist threat, as indicated by the endless series of violent terrorist attacks, including the blast outside the Russian Embassy in Kabul on September 5.
To normalise the situation in Afghanistan, naturally, we have to work together to help it with economic recovery. But first of all, we strongly insist on compensating for the damage caused to the Afghan people during the years of occupation and unblocking the unlawfully frozen Afghan funds.
In the context of a settlement in Afghanistan, it would be helpful to use the resources of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and its regional anti-terrorist body.
We also invite all Asian countries to engage in closer cooperation with the International Counter-Terrorist Data Bank, established at Russia's initiative.
I would like to point out that Russia and China have drafted a joint statement for this summit on cooperation in ICT security. We hope that the joint statement will be approved.
Finally, I would like to mention the importance of strengthening multilateral cooperation between the participating countries on social, cultural and humanitarian issues and in promoting the inter-civilisational dialogue and contacts between peoples.
In particular, volunteer movements are among those that require support. The acute stage of the Covid-19 pandemic that we have passed demonstrated the helpful role of volunteer and youth groups in supporting the population. Russia has accumulated extensive and useful experience in these matters and we are ready to share it with interested countries.
Overall, I would like to note with satisfaction that our joint work within this Conference on Mutual Interaction and Confidence Building is making progress. Russia will further develop multi-dimensional cooperation with all represented parties.
We support the initiatives of the Kazakh presidency.
Thank you.
