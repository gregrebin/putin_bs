Our relations have very deep roots. You know Russia’s stance on Palestine’s problems and the Palestinian-Israeli settlement. It is a principled stance based on the fundamental resolutions of the United Nations and it remains unchanged.
There is no doubt here; we have always spoken in favour of a just settlement according to international law. In this sense, you can be assured of our position. This is my first point.
The second, of course, is that we are carefully watching what is going on in the region, and I am very happy to meet with you to hear your opinion on the situation.
In our bilateral relations, we have said many times that a lot must still be done for economic ties to develop more actively, and there are necessary prerequisites for this. Our culture and education sector is also well represented. Today I believe 650 Palestinian students are studying in Russia, and we are training them in various areas.
In short, it is a pleasure to see you, Mr President.
President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
I was looking forward to meeting with you. Of course, the coronavirus made it impossible to meet in person for a long time. I am glad that we were able to have telephone conversations once in a while.
It is good that we can hear your news and you can hear ours.
We always and unfailingly believe and know that Russia has a clear position on the settlement, and I am absolutely certain that it will never change. We know perfectly well that Russia stands for justice, for international law. For us, this is a dogma. We also stand for the fact that international law must be respected: this is not what I want; it is a norm that must be respected. We are glad that we have such a partner in Russia.
Of course, I would like to note that we need to intensify the work of the quartet on a settlement. It is necessary to step up its activity in order to help settle the Palestinian problem. We know that it is the quartet that should be doing this, and not someone in particular, for example, the Americans. You know of our position.
We do not want America to single-handedly deal with the solution to the Palestinian problem under any umbrella or pretext. It can be a member of the quartet and play a role there, but we will never accept it monopolising the settlement issue.
Another point that interests us in relation to Russia is the issue of training our students, specialists, including military personnel, and economic cooperation. We are glad that you are giving this due attention.
We are also quite in need of foodstuffs. You know what events are taking place on the global stage, but during our last stay in Russia, we were confident that this issue could be resolved positively. I mean delivering Russian wheat to us from time to time. You are aware of our needs; you know the format of this request. The question is about how to periodically carry out such deliveries. This would only add to our confidence that Russia has a positive attitude towards us and towards the settlement process.

Russia remains one of Azerbaijan’s leading trade and economic partners. Trade is growing steadily – by 14 percent last year, I believe, and by another 7 percent or more in the first seven months of this year. Our economic operators have invested $4.5 billion in the Azerbaijani economy.
The co-chairs of the intergovernmental commission meet on a regular basis, working on joint projects in line with the plan you proposed through 2024, as far as I know. It includes a number of promising and interesting projects that you proposed.
Naturally, we always keep under review the various aspects of the ongoing settlement process in the region. I hope that we will use this opportunity to discuss all these matters again and compare notes.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: I am happy to see you again, Mr Putin.
You are absolutely right; we do meet regularly. We met just recently in St Petersburg, and before that, we met in Samarkand last month. Our relations are progressing so rapidly that, as you have said, we frequently need to compare notes on many issues.
We are very pleased with the way relations between our countries are faring. I would say they have reached the highest level, where we have allied cooperation, and we are making substantial progress on many issues.
You mentioned bilateral trade and economic ties, and I would like to confirm that trade is on the rise between Russia and Azerbaijan. The projects that we have now outlined and agreed on at previous meetings will definitely promote further growth.
We also see positive dynamics in other areas such as transport, energy, and humanitarian cooperation.
And of course, at each of our meetings, we never fail to discuss the issues facing our region, security issues, and ways to achieve peace. We will also talk about this today. We are committed to a long-term peace, and for our part, we believe that we have made a very constructive case for peace to be finally achieved.
Thank you again for this opportunity to meet. I am sure that this meeting will also be very productive.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Japarov
, Mr Rahmon
,
For a long time, we have been planning to meet in this format and have been coordinating a meeting. Finally, it was organized on the sidelines of today’s event. I would like to thank you for agreeing to talk, to meet in this format.
Of course, we have met before – face to face, one on one and all three. So, this is not something entirely new, but I still think it is important. I would like to note that Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are our close allies. We are working very closely in international organisations and are strategic partners, without question. Suffice it to mention the million Kyrgyz citizens and two million Tajik citizens who live, study and work in the Russian Federation.

We have very close ties in many areas. Our trade is growing. We recorded a roughly 45 percent increase on both sides during the past year, and 20–30 percent in the first seven months of this year. This is trade on a very large scale.
Of course, we are interested in maintaining these conditions, or creating them anew where necessary, for the sake of steady, gradual development.
I am very happy to be meeting in this format.
Thank you once again.

The start of Russian-Qatari talks
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Highness, friends,
We are happy, our delegation is happy to see our Qatari friends. We already started talking about current issues during our working lunch.
I would like to say that I am very happy to see you again. It will be a pleasure to see you in Russia as well, as we agreed.
I would like to begin our conversation by saying that relations between Russia and Qatar are developing successfully. The volume of our mutual trade is not large yet, but there is a notable development trend. Investment activities are underway thanks to your personal involvement. It should be said that they are highly diversified, with investments made in many fields, including such highly-required areas as pharmaceuticals, the production of fertilisers and infrastructure. I think this is very interesting and we will be happy to continue doing this.

We are also doing everything we can in terms of sharing our experience of preparations for the football world championship. You are aware of that, because we had an opportunity to talk about it. I would like to wish you success in hosting this major event. I am sure that this is the way it is going to be.
Your Highness, it is a pleasure to meet you again.
Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to meet today.
As we said during lunch earlier, there are many issues on our bilateral agenda. It can be said that there is a historic connection between our countries.
Qatar has made many investments in the Russian economy, and these investments have not been in vain; they are quite successful. As you pointed out, trade between our countries does not fully meet the standards of our interaction on the political stage, but there is an opportunity to build it up thanks to cooperation in all the spheres, which you have mentioned. There are also good prospects in infrastructure, energy, agriculture and other spheres.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate you on the success Russia achieved during preparations for and the hosting of the world football championship in 2018. It is a major asset for Qatar. Our country is making use of your experience when preparing to host the championship. Thank you very much for your assistance in our preparations for the upcoming tournament. Work is ongoing, and our coordination will continue all the way until the beginning of that sports event.
Mr President, thank you very much.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you for the excellent organisation and for creating a fan zone for Russian fans.
