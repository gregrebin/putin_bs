It has been a long time since we saw each other in person due to pandemic restrictions. However, we have stayed in contact, directly by telephone and through our colleagues.

Our relations have very deep roots. You know Russia’s stance on Palestine’s problems and the Palestinian-Israeli settlement. It is a principled stance based on the fundamental resolutions of the United Nations and it remains unchanged.
There is no doubt here; we have always spoken in favour of a just settlement according to international law. In this sense, you can be assured of our position. This is my first point.
The second, of course, is that we are carefully watching what is going on in the region, and I am very happy to meet with you to hear your opinion on the situation.
In our bilateral relations, we have said many times that a lot must still be done for economic ties to develop more actively, and there are necessary prerequisites for this. Our culture and education sector is also well represented. Today I believe 650 Palestinian students are studying in Russia, and we are training them in various areas.
In short, it is a pleasure to see you, Mr President.
President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President.
I was looking forward to meeting with you. Of course, the coronavirus made it impossible to meet in person for a long time. I am glad that we were able to have telephone conversations once in a while.
It is good that we can hear your news and you can hear ours.
We always and unfailingly believe and know that Russia has a clear position on the settlement, and I am absolutely certain that it will never change. We know perfectly well that Russia stands for justice, for international law. For us, this is a dogma. We also stand for the fact that international law must be respected: this is not what I want; it is a norm that must be respected. We are glad that we have such a partner in Russia.
Of course, I would like to note that we need to intensify the work of the quartet on a settlement. It is necessary to step up its activity in order to help settle the Palestinian problem. We know that it is the quartet that should be doing this, and not someone in particular, for example, the Americans. You know of our position.
We do not want America to single-handedly deal with the solution to the Palestinian problem under any umbrella or pretext. It can be a member of the quartet and play a role there, but we will never accept it monopolising the settlement issue.
Another point that interests us in relation to Russia is the issue of training our students, specialists, including military personnel, and economic cooperation. We are glad that you are giving this due attention.
We are also quite in need of foodstuffs. You know what events are taking place on the global stage, but during our last stay in Russia, we were confident that this issue could be resolved positively. I mean delivering Russian wheat to us from time to time. You are aware of our needs; you know the format of this request. The question is about how to periodically carry out such deliveries. This would only add to our confidence that Russia has a positive attitude towards us and towards the settlement process.

Russia remains one of Azerbaijan’s leading trade and economic partners. Trade is growing steadily – by 14 percent last year, I believe, and by another 7 percent or more in the first seven months of this year. Our economic operators have invested $4.5 billion in the Azerbaijani economy.
The co-chairs of the intergovernmental commission meet on a regular basis, working on joint projects in line with the plan you proposed through 2024, as far as I know. It includes a number of promising and interesting projects that you proposed.
Naturally, we always keep under review the various aspects of the ongoing settlement process in the region. I hope that we will use this opportunity to discuss all these matters again and compare notes.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev
: I am happy to see you again, Mr Putin.
You are absolutely right; we do meet regularly. We met just recently in St Petersburg, and before that, we met in Samarkand last month. Our relations are progressing so rapidly that, as you have said, we frequently need to compare notes on many issues.
We are very pleased with the way relations between our countries are faring. I would say they have reached the highest level, where we have allied cooperation, and we are making substantial progress on many issues.
You mentioned bilateral trade and economic ties, and I would like to confirm that trade is on the rise between Russia and Azerbaijan. The projects that we have now outlined and agreed on at previous meetings will definitely promote further growth.
We also see positive dynamics in other areas such as transport, energy, and humanitarian cooperation.
And of course, at each of our meetings, we never fail to discuss the issues facing our region, security issues, and ways to achieve peace. We will also talk about this today. We are committed to a long-term peace, and for our part, we believe that we have made a very constructive case for peace to be finally achieved.
Thank you again for this opportunity to meet. I am sure that this meeting will also be very productive.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Japarov
, Mr Rahmon
,
For a long time, we have been planning to meet in this format and have been coordinating a meeting. Finally, it was organized on the sidelines of today’s event. I would like to thank you for agreeing to talk, to meet in this format.
Of course, we have met before – face to face, one on one and all three. So, this is not something entirely new, but I still think it is important. I would like to note that Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are our close allies. We are working very closely in international organisations and are strategic partners, without question. Suffice it to mention the million Kyrgyz citizens and two million Tajik citizens who live, study and work in the Russian Federation.

We have very close ties in many areas. Our trade is growing. We recorded a roughly 45 percent increase on both sides during the past year, and 20–30 percent in the first seven months of this year. This is trade on a very large scale.
Of course, we are interested in maintaining these conditions, or creating them anew where necessary, for the sake of steady, gradual development.
I am very happy to be meeting in this format.
Thank you once again.
