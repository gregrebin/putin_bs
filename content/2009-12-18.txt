Copenhagen
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Prime Minister, I am pleased to have this chance to meet with you. Despite the late hour, we are both here in Copenhagen to work, and I hope that we can discuss not only climate issues but also our bilateral relations.
I congratulate you on having completed the process of forming a new government cabinet, and on the fact that all institutions of government are now active. I hope that this will help us to build good and solid relations between our countries.
Prime Minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri (as translated into Russian): Thank you very much, Mr President, for this opportunity to meet. The fact that you have agreed to meet with us at such a late hour confirms that you personally and the entire Russian leadership take an interest in our country and want to develop our bilateral relations.
We are aware, of course, of how busy you are with various subjects, including climate issues, but we also know that Russia has always stood by our country in both easy and difficult times, and we hope that the future will inject new vigour into our bilateral cooperation.

Statements following Meeting with President of the United States Barack Obama
December 18, 2009
22:22
Copenhagen
President of The United States Barack Obama: Obviously our main concern in coming to Copenhagen was to try to move forward with an accord on the issue of climate change. But on the margins of this meeting we thought it was important to continue to build on the excellent relationship that our two governments have developed over the last several months.
Our main focus today was the START treaty â€“ the new START treaty that we have been negotiating. We've been making excellent progress. We are quite close to an agreement. And I'm confident that it will be completed in a timely fashion. And I just want to thank President Medvedev for being a very effective partner in these negotiations.
And we wish him a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: As an effective partner I, in turn, would like to thank President Obama, but using different words, as is customary in diplomatic practice.
It is true that we did not come to Copenhagen to have a bilateral meeting; rather, we came here to move forward in reaching an agreement on climate-related matters. And in this regard, our work is not yet finished. But at the same time, it would be a sin not to use this opportunity to discuss a topic that we have been working on recently, quite effectively and harmoniously.
I would like to thank President Obama and all the negotiators involved in developing the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty from the American side.
Our positions are very close, and we are now in agreement on nearly all the issues we have been discussing in recent months. We still need to negotiate a few technical details, which must be fully clarified in such an important treaty. I hope that we will be able to do this fairly quickly, and that the results we reach will reflect the partnership and close relations that we have established with the new U.S. administration.
I would say, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
