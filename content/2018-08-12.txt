President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very glad to have the opportunity to personally meet with you on the sidelines of the summit and exchange opinions on a whole range of various issues.
There is much cooperation between our countries. We have many issues to address regarding the world’s acute crises, including that in Syria. I would like to inform you about the progress of our contacts with our partners on this complicated problem.
Although our colleagues are in constant contact with each other, personal meetings at such level are highly important.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani
(retranslated): Mr President,
I am very glad to have this opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the Caspian Summit. And I am very glad that with each year our relations are developing positively.
Recently, Iran has officially reinforced its cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union. This may make for the development of trade between our countries.
Another sphere of our interaction is bilateral cooperation in fighting terrorism and bringing stability to the region.
Our common goal is to establish stability and peace in the whole region and provide security for the region’s countries. The world has witnessed how, with the help from Iran and Russia, the Syrian army was able to play a vital role in fighting terrorism in Syria.
I must emphasise that today all measures being taken by Iran, Russia and Turkey are helping to establish peace and security in the Syrian Arab Republic.
In the recent years, we have reached two important achievements. The first one is cooperation between Iran, Russia and other countries in achieving agreements on the Iranian Nuclear Deal.
The second one is how Iran, Russia and Turkey cooperate in establishing peace and security in Syria.
We are committed to the elimination of any hurdles and the settling of any global crises solely within the framework of dialogue and talks.

Statement by Vladimir Putin following the Fifth Caspian Summit
President of Russia made a press statement following the Fifth Caspian Summit.
August 12, 2018

Aktau
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
Today, a very important and landmark event has taken place – the signing of the Convention On the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, an international agreement that contains a detailed and comprehensive set of rules and obligations on the use and preservation of our common treasure – the Caspian Sea. Thus, the multifaceted interaction of the 'Caspian five' states was given a present-day legal foundation that will serve us for years to come.
It is crucially important to note that the Convention confers upon the five states exclusive and sovereign rights to use the Caspian Sea, to pursue its responsible development and to use its assets and other resources, while firmly securing the settlement of all pressing issues based on the principles of consensus and mutual consideration of each other’s interests, and bestowing upon the Caspian a peaceful status, and ensuring that armed forces of non-regional countries are not present in the Caspian region.
We have been striving for many years to develop and approve this strategic and fundamental document. Substantial efforts have been made to hold negotiations with the participation of numerous government agencies of our countries and have involved experts from business communities.
The success achieved – and this is undoubtedly a success – was made possible largely due to the high level of trust and mutual understanding that exists between the leaders of the Caspian states and our readiness to always follow the logic of respect, partnership and equality. I would like to express appreciation to all heads of state present today.
Such a joint approach actually showed its efficiency and relevance. It showed that joint efforts can result in achieving ambitious goals in any, even the most complicated issues, in finding a compromise and balanced solutions of mutual interest. In today's difficult international conditions, this carries a lot of weight.
The signing of the Convention opens a new stage in the relations of the Caspian states and allows us to secure prosperity and provide for dynamic development of our common region together.
I note with satisfaction that today we have also signed a comprehensive package of agreements that expand and add to the Convention in the most important and pressing issues of interaction.
The plans of the Caspian states include boosting economic cooperation, expanding trade and investment ties, cooperation in the energy sector, developing the region's transport and logistic potential, and boosting tourist flows. Particular attention will be paid to preserving the rich nature and biodiversity of the Caspian Sea.
Of course, the Caspian countries attach great importance to the issues of security and counteracting today's challenges and threats. We have to take into account the fact that the Caspian Sea is located near hotbeds of tension and areas of international terrorist activity – I am referring to the Middle East and Afghanistan.
That is why our countries are committed to strengthening comprehensive interaction of our special services and border agencies, and to promoting coordination in foreign policy.
All the above-mentioned issues form an actual and positive long-term agenda for Caspian cooperation. We are facing serious and interesting tasks. And we are intent on consistently solving them.
In conclusion, I would like to once again express my appreciation to our Kazakh friends and President Nazarbayev, first of all, for the warm hospitality, and congratulate all of us and all colleagues on the successful holding of this summit.
Thank you for your attention.

With President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Mr Putin, thank you very much for your and the delegation’s active participation at this meeting [the Fifth Caspian Summit], which is important for all of us.
We know that you have taken an active part in talks with various members of the Caspian states. This has made its effect and today we have reached a good, historic decision, with the Convention being adopted for the first time, and this matter is mostly settled. Now a path has opened for the Caspian countries to cooperate and settle issues further.
Our bilateral relations have been developing in all areas. This year, we will have an interregional meeting in Petropavlovsk, and a CIS meeting in Dushanbe, as far as I remember. During all these meetings, you and I meet separately to discuss our bilateral relations; this helps us resolve all our issues.
Among the questions we have yet to discuss is the issue of CSTO Secretary-General, which has become a problem now.
I am grateful to you for the support in settling all the issues regarding the cosmodrome. The agreement signed on the Baiterek programme is running its course; investors are showing up, and we will together build another launching unit.
As regards military and technical cooperation, yesterday our ministers held a meeting. We have appointed a new defence minister, and our ministers discussed all pertinent issues as well.
Our economic ties within the EAEU and bilateral ties are on the upswing, for which I am grateful to you and the Russian Government.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev,
First I would like to congratulate you on the results of the summit of heads of the Caspian states and say that this event will undoubtedly go down in history as the one that took place in Kazakhstan.
This is a major event that we have been striving to reach for two decades; we held frank discussions and sought out a solution, and this solution has been found at last. This will contribute to the development of our cooperation in the Caspian region.
As regards our relations in a broader context, under CSTO and EAEU, this is a substantial agenda and a large programme. There are several problematic issues, you have just mentioned one of them regarding CSTO.
But as regards bilateral relations, our mutual trade is growing, and major projects, which we talk about and which we support, are developing, such as Baiterek and other programmes, as well as our cooperation in the energy and transport sectors.
Overall, there are numerous interesting initiatives. I am confident that all our programmes will develop successfully, and we will achieve good results.
I would like to thank you for the attention your personally pay to the development of Russian-Kazakhstani relations.
Nursultan Nazarbayev: Thank you.

Speech at the Fifth Caspian Summit
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev, colleagues, friends,
I agree with those colleagues who have spoken before me: this summit is indeed extraordinary, if not historic.

Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea
August 12, 2018
The Convention On the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, a document that we have been negotiating for over 20 years, at last formalises our exclusive rights and the responsibility each of us carries to protect the future of the Caspian Sea, and it establishes clear guidelines for its collective use.
I want to thank everybody involved in this major project, heads of state, negotiators and experts alike.
Based on consensus and consideration for our mutual interests, we have produced a modern and balanced international agreement. The convention will replace the Soviet-Iranian agreements of 1921 and 1940.
It is important that the Convention regulates the issues of necessary delimitations, regimes of navigation and fishing, establishes the principles of political and military interaction of member states, and ensures the use of the Caspian Sea solely for peaceful purposes and the non-presence of the armed forces of non-regional states in the sea.
Regulating the legal status of the Caspian Sea creates the necessary conditions for taking the level of cooperation between the countries to a brand new level and will serve to develop closer interaction in various areas. The six specialised agreements in the economic, transport and security areas that were signed today, among others, will provide the necessary legal foundation for this. It is Russia’s aim to work jointly with all Caspian states on the implementation of these agreements.
In particular, the agreement on economic cooperation in the Caspian region will serve as basis for paying priority attention to boosting regional, trade and economic ties, as well as enhancing close and mutually beneficial cooperation.

Statement by Vladimir Putin following the Fifth Caspian Summit
August 12, 2018
I should note that the volume of trade between Russia and the Caspian states constantly grows. In 2017, foreign trade increased by over 20 percent and amounted to $22 billion, while in January and February this year it grew by over 10 percent.
The decisions being adopted on establishing the Caspian economic forum will allow us to reinforce contacts between our countries' business communities.
Russia suggests that the 'Caspian five' states focus on cooperation in the digital economy, actively introducing information and communication technologies and e-commerce, and engaging in the digitisation of foreign trade operations, cargo transportation and logistics.
We expect that the intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in transport in the Caspian region will serve to develop a common integrated infrastructure. Transport interconnection is one of the key factors for securing sustainable growth and strengthening our countries' cooperation.
In this regard, I would like to inform you that Russia has adopted and is currently implementing the Strategy for the Development of Marine Ports in the Caspian Sea until 2030. It defines the prospects for comprehensive modernisation of the Caspian sea communications and related railway and motor transport infrastructure.
In particular, there are plans to construct a new deep-water port near Kaspiysk that will receive large-capacity ships with actual loads of 15,000–25,000 tons.
We are taking strides to integrate Russia’s port capabilities into global and Eurasian transport and logistic networks, increase the competitiveness of cargo and passenger transportations, and multiply the volumes of processed cargo.
We support the project of the International North–South Transport Corridor, which provides for rail, ferry and automobile services, which we intend to develop.
Its launch will allow for a 2.5-fold increase in the speed of transporting cargo, which will amount to 25 million tonnes delivered annually via Iran from European countries to the Middle East and South Asia.
The development of a five-party agreement on cooperation in marine transport could go a long way in developing international transportation and providing equal unified conditions for transit across the Caspian Sea. Experts from the five countries can now more closely engage in drafting such an agreement.
I should note that tourism is a promising area of cooperation as well. According to available estimates, Caspian Sea resorts could receive over one million vacationers annually. Yet, this requires a modern tourism infrastructure.
Russia is building the cruise ship Pyotr Veliky (preliminary commissioning deadline is 2019), which, once built, can be used for circuit cruises in the Caspian Sea, stopping in all five Caspian states, and also carry out cruises in the Caspian and Black seas as well as in the Sea of Azov.
We also plan to boost the development of tourist clusters in coastal areas, building new hotels and recreation centres. The relevant authorities of the five countries should draw up a programme for such joint projects in tourism.
We deem it equally important for the Caspian states to interact in preserving the environment and biological resources. The five states already are successfully implementing a number of beneficial agreements, such as the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea, Agreement on the Rational Use of the Biological Resources of the Caspian Sea, and the Protocol on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context.
These documents provide for strict environmental control over infrastructure projects that may create potential risks for the Caspian Sea.
Last year, a specialised intergovernmental commission of the 'Caspian five' adopted an important decision on extending a ban on commercial fishing of sturgeon. Russia welcomes the temporary ban on fishing for this valuable species and is ready to support a longer moratorium. It is advisable to quickly complete work on documents that will regulate our joint fight against poaching.
Colleagues, we are well aware of the responsibility of the Caspian states to provide security in the region. There are spots of instability in close proximity to the Caspian Sea, such as the Middle East and Afghanistan, and therefore our core interests and even life itself require that we cooperate closely.
 It is important for the 'Caspian five' states to further boost consistent interaction in fighting terrorism and organised crime and to expand the joint efforts of our special services and border agencies. Corresponding protocols to the agreement on cooperation in security of 2010, to be signed today, are aimed at this.
Russia fully supports these decisions and is ready to actively engage in their implementation. In the future, we should also think about developing a separate document on cooperation to stop drug trafficking in the Caspian region.
We deem it important to develop partner relations in the area of our naval forces, in particular, to implement regular reciprocal visits of our ships, expand the mutual participation of ship crews in various events, such as the Sea Cup international competition as part of the International Army Games in the Caspian region.
The intergovernmental agreement on prevention of incidents in the Caspian Sea is very important, as it will considerably strengthen the system of confidence-building measures in the region.
Regular consultations as regards our countries' navies and regular meetings of our naval commanders could serve as an efficient mechanism of cooperation in this field.
And of course, joint efforts should be continued under the agreement on cooperation in emergency prevention and response.
Our rescue services hold joint exercises, and act out special scenarios of incidents and possible disasters to rehearse joint actions. This practice must undoubtedly be continued.
In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Nazarbayev for the major efforts Kazakhstan has made to prepare this important meeting.
Thank you for attention.
