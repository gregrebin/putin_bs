President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very glad to have the opportunity to personally meet with you on the sidelines of the summit and exchange opinions on a whole range of various issues.
There is much cooperation between our countries. We have many issues to address regarding the world’s acute crises, including that in Syria. I would like to inform you about the progress of our contacts with our partners on this complicated problem.
Although our colleagues are in constant contact with each other, personal meetings at such level are highly important.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani
(retranslated): Mr President,
I am very glad to have this opportunity to meet with you on the sidelines of the Caspian Summit. And I am very glad that with each year our relations are developing positively.
Recently, Iran has officially reinforced its cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union. This may make for the development of trade between our countries.
Another sphere of our interaction is bilateral cooperation in fighting terrorism and bringing stability to the region.
Our common goal is to establish stability and peace in the whole region and provide security for the region’s countries. The world has witnessed how, with the help from Iran and Russia, the Syrian army was able to play a vital role in fighting terrorism in Syria.
I must emphasise that today all measures being taken by Iran, Russia and Turkey are helping to establish peace and security in the Syrian Arab Republic.
In the recent years, we have reached two important achievements. The first one is cooperation between Iran, Russia and other countries in achieving agreements on the Iranian Nuclear Deal.
The second one is how Iran, Russia and Turkey cooperate in establishing peace and security in Syria.
We are committed to the elimination of any hurdles and the settling of any global crises solely within the framework of dialogue and talks.

Statement by Vladimir Putin following the Fifth Caspian Summit
President of Russia made a press statement following the Fifth Caspian Summit.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
Today, a very important and landmark event has taken place – the signing of the Convention On the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, an international agreement that contains a detailed and comprehensive set of rules and obligations on the use and preservation of our common treasure – the Caspian Sea. Thus, the multifaceted interaction of the 'Caspian five' states was given a present-day legal foundation that will serve us for years to come.
It is crucially important to note that the Convention confers upon the five states exclusive and sovereign rights to use the Caspian Sea, to pursue its responsible development and to use its assets and other resources, while firmly securing the settlement of all pressing issues based on the principles of consensus and mutual consideration of each other’s interests, and bestowing upon the Caspian a peaceful status, and ensuring that armed forces of non-regional countries are not present in the Caspian region.
We have been striving for many years to develop and approve this strategic and fundamental document. Substantial efforts have been made to hold negotiations with the participation of numerous government agencies of our countries and have involved experts from business communities.
The success achieved – and this is undoubtedly a success – was made possible largely due to the high level of trust and mutual understanding that exists between the leaders of the Caspian states and our readiness to always follow the logic of respect, partnership and equality. I would like to express appreciation to all heads of state present today.
Such a joint approach actually showed its efficiency and relevance. It showed that joint efforts can result in achieving ambitious goals in any, even the most complicated issues, in finding a compromise and balanced solutions of mutual interest. In today's difficult international conditions, this carries a lot of weight.
The signing of the Convention opens a new stage in the relations of the Caspian states and allows us to secure prosperity and provide for dynamic development of our common region together.
I note with satisfaction that today we have also signed a comprehensive package of agreements that expand and add to the Convention in the most important and pressing issues of interaction.
The plans of the Caspian states include boosting economic cooperation, expanding trade and investment ties, cooperation in the energy sector, developing the region's transport and logistic potential, and boosting tourist flows. Particular attention will be paid to preserving the rich nature and biodiversity of the Caspian Sea.
Of course, the Caspian countries attach great importance to the issues of security and counteracting today's challenges and threats. We have to take into account the fact that the Caspian Sea is located near hotbeds of tension and areas of international terrorist activity – I am referring to the Middle East and Afghanistan.
That is why our countries are committed to strengthening comprehensive interaction of our special services and border agencies, and to promoting coordination in foreign policy.
All the above-mentioned issues form an actual and positive long-term agenda for Caspian cooperation. We are facing serious and interesting tasks. And we are intent on consistently solving them.
In conclusion, I would like to once again express my appreciation to our Kazakh friends and President Nazarbayev, first of all, for the warm hospitality, and congratulate all of us and all colleagues on the successful holding of this summit.
Thank you for your attention.

With President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev
: Mr Putin, thank you very much for your and the delegation’s active participation at this meeting [the Fifth Caspian Summit], which is important for all of us.
We know that you have taken an active part in talks with various members of the Caspian states. This has made its effect and today we have reached a good, historic decision, with the Convention being adopted for the first time, and this matter is mostly settled. Now a path has opened for the Caspian countries to cooperate and settle issues further.
Our bilateral relations have been developing in all areas. This year, we will have an interregional meeting in Petropavlovsk, and a CIS meeting in Dushanbe, as far as I remember. During all these meetings, you and I meet separately to discuss our bilateral relations; this helps us resolve all our issues.
Among the questions we have yet to discuss is the issue of CSTO Secretary-General, which has become a problem now.
I am grateful to you for the support in settling all the issues regarding the cosmodrome. The agreement signed on the Baiterek programme is running its course; investors are showing up, and we will together build another launching unit.
As regards military and technical cooperation, yesterday our ministers held a meeting. We have appointed a new defence minister, and our ministers discussed all pertinent issues as well.
Our economic ties within the EAEU and bilateral ties are on the upswing, for which I am grateful to you and the Russian Government.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Nazarbayev,
First I would like to congratulate you on the results of the summit of heads of the Caspian states and say that this event will undoubtedly go down in history as the one that took place in Kazakhstan.
This is a major event that we have been striving to reach for two decades; we held frank discussions and sought out a solution, and this solution has been found at last. This will contribute to the development of our cooperation in the Caspian region.
As regards our relations in a broader context, under CSTO and EAEU, this is a substantial agenda and a large programme. There are several problematic issues, you have just mentioned one of them regarding CSTO.
But as regards bilateral relations, our mutual trade is growing, and major projects, which we talk about and which we support, are developing, such as Baiterek and other programmes, as well as our cooperation in the energy and transport sectors.
Overall, there are numerous interesting initiatives. I am confident that all our programmes will develop successfully, and we will achieve good results.
I would like to thank you for the attention your personally pay to the development of Russian-Kazakhstani relations.
Nursultan Nazarbayev: Thank you.
