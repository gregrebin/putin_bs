Chess player Sergei Karyakin.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Karyakin, you became a grandmaster at 12, didn’t you?
Sergei Karyakin: Yes, I was the youngest.
Vladimir Putin: You have achieved great success since then, and I congratulate you on it. At the end of last year, you won the World Blitz Championship.
Sergei Karyakin: Yes, I became the World Blitz champion.
Vladimir Putin: My congratulations.
Sergei Karyakin: Thank you very much.
And thank you very much for inviting me, I am very happy to be here.
Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you for what you have been doing to promote chess and discuss what else can be done. You know that we opened a chess section at the Sirius Centre for Children in Sochi. Have you been there?
Sergei Karyakin: Yes, I have been there. We actually saw each other briefly during the school opening. I also wanted to discuss this subject. There are several topics for us to discuss related to developing chess in the regions.
But first, I would like to invite you on behalf of the Russian Chess Federation. The Chess Club on Gogolevsky Boulevard recently opened after its renovation with Mr Sobyanin’s [Moscow Mayor] support. It has an absolutely unique chess museum and we invite you to visit it. It has some truly unique items on display and I think you would like it very much.
Vladimir Putin: Indeed, our school of chess is very good and, I should mention, both in St Petersburg and in Moscow. Therefore, I will be glad to visit. We will choose the best time for the visit.
Sergei Karyakin: Yes, of course.

Working meeting with Orel Region Governor Vadim Potomsky.
In keeping with the President’s instructions, the Presidential Executive Office is analysing questions that came in during Direct Line by region and federal subject. Vladimir Putin stressed that this work should be systematic, covering practically the country’s entire territory.
The President drew the Governor’s attention to a number of issues that are a source of concern to people living in Orel Region, in particular, employment, unsafe housing, the lack of medications for those entitled to free or subsidised medications, rising utilities and housing maintenance costs, water supply, the lack of free school textbooks and the condition of roads.
The President gave Mr Potomsky summary materials and specific issues to work on, stressing that this work will be conducted with practically each Russian region, with the results to be reviewed at a corresponding meeting.
The Governor responded to some of the questions that were raised and promised that after studying the situation thoroughly, he would respond to all questions from residents.
Governor Potomsky also commented on the situation in the region in general.

Meeting of Commission for Military Technical Cooperation with Foreign States
Vladimir Putin held a meeting of the Commission for Military Technical Cooperation with Foreign States.

Meeting of Commission for Military Technical Cooperation with Foreign States.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today we are holding a regular meeting of the Commission for Military Technical Cooperation with Foreign States. Before we turn to the agenda, I would like to mention, or, to be more precise, recall an event that has a direct bearing on our discussion.
As you may know, on June 28 the Kremlin hosted a gala reception in honour of distinguished graduates of military academies. It is no exaggeration to say that they are the backbone of our Armed Forces, highly skilled professionals with the most advanced military knowledge.
I would also like to note that this year over a thousand army service personnel from 30 countries graduated from Russia’s schools of higher learning. About 8,000 foreign students study in Defence Ministry schools, with about a third of them from the CSTO member-states.
There is growing demand in the global arms market for qualified military specialists. In this context the training of military personnel, teaching them to operate Russian weapons and equipment, and building up the export of military services, should remain a major component of the military technical cooperation system.
Furthermore, competition in the world arms market is obviously growing; you know this better than anyone does. The combat efficiency of arms is a decisive criterion for potential buyers. I would like to note that Russian weapons have demonstrated reliability and wide-ranging functionality during the anti-terrorist operation in Syria, something we have discussed. It is necessary to carefully analyse this combat experience both for upgrading existing systems and for developing new and advanced combat hardware.
At the same time, it is necessary to enhance the military industrial cooperation framework itself. For this purpose, major structural changes have been made to the Russian defence industry. Major defence holdings have been brought together under one administration for the convenience of cooperation, production upgrades and higher financial stability.
Several major groups were granted the right to foreign trade, which significantly increases their independence in talks and accelerates contractual work. Moreover, this measure is supposed to make military industrial cooperation easier and more convenient for foreign customers as well. I am referring to the opportunity to directly negotiate with arms manufacturers and to conduct the entire scope of operations from marketing to maintenance and repair of supplied equipment. In other words, these conditions provide for more efficient cooperation between the Russian defence industry companies and their foreign partners for the sake of further innovative development of the domestic industry.
I will emphasise that the defence industry companies that were granted the right to engage in foreign trade are assuming all responsibility for the quality of their products and compliance with the contractual terms of their foreign supplies. However, the Commission and other involved agencies should still be monitoring these activities. It is important to prevent any disruptions in the new procedure and to carefully monitor the operations.
I already spoke about the current use of Russian weapons, particularly in the fight against terrorists in the Syrian Arab Republic. I would like to thank both the military personnel, and the designers and developers of one of our latest missile systems, Kh-101. This missile system has proved highly reliable. It is indeed the most advanced weapon with high precision and capacity, and a range of 4,500 km, which is quite good. A weapon of this class must be in the centre of our attention and the attention of our defence agencies and industrial companies.
All our decisions on supplies of arms to external markets are based on the current international situation in various regions – in order to prevent any imbalances and to avoid an escalation of conflicts. On the contrary, our weapons must be used to contain conflicts at the early stages.
Let us discuss all these topics in more detail.
