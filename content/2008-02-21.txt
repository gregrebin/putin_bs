Novo-Ogaryevo
President of The Russian Federation Vladimir Putin:
Ilham Geidarovich,
First of all, I would like to thank you for coming to Moscow to attend this informal summit. Of course, I also want to take this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations. Frankly speaking, there are no real problems in our relations and we have made considerable progress in our economic ties. The increase in our bilateral trade was not as impressive last year as the year before last, but overall the positive dynamic remains strong. We are pleased to see that Russian investors are investing ever more actively in Azerbaijan’s economy, and we are grateful to you for the conditions that your country’s government offers Russian companies. I will not list them all now, they are well known. Our investment activity is developing and our cooperation in the energy sector is also growing stronger. There are several issues I would like to discuss separately with you today. We are very happy to see you here in Moscow. Welcome!
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliev: Thank you, Vladimir Vladimirovich. Thank you for this invitation to visit Moscow and for this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations. I fully agree with you that we have no problems. We are making steady progress in all areas. Our countries are working together very effectively in political, economic and humanitarian cooperation. Overall, our relations, which we see as those of friends and good neighbours, are growing stronger. You noted the good investment climate in Azerbaijan and the fact that Russian companies find a comfortable working environment in our country. They enjoy the same rights as local companies. We welcome increased Russian investment in Azerbaijan. I note too that many companies are now taking part as subcontractors in various construction and infrastructure projects. We are very happy with the level of business relations that has been established. Our business communities look to our countries’ leadership as a reference and rightly so. They see the active political cooperation between our countries and this gives them greater confidence and comfort. Azerbaijani companies are also working on the Russian market and enjoy full rights there. I am satisfied with the way our relations are developing. During today’s meeting I would like to examine bilateral issues and also regional cooperation issues and the events taking place in the world that need to be discussed.

Beginning of Meeting with President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili
February 21, 2008
19:10
Novo-Ogaryevo
President of The Russian Federation Vladimir Putin: Mikhail Nikolayevich,
First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting our invitation and coming to this informal CIS summit. I know that our relations are starting to improve in a number of different areas. We have noted your statements that the Georgian leadership seeks better relations with Russia, and we are very pleased to hear this. We will do our best to reply in kind. I know that our aviation authorities have reached an agreement in principle on settling the differences between them, above all the question of debt settlement. This means we will be able to resume flights between our countries and also settle a number of the other issues that had come up. We have a fair number of problems to address but I think we will able to take advantage of your being here for the CIS summit and discuss all of these different issues today.
President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili: Yes, I think so. First of all, Vladimir Vladimirovich, I am very happy to have been able to come to this summit. This will be the last CIS summit during your term in office and I did not want to miss this occasion.
I regret that you have not yet managed to make a visit to Georgia as President, but I invite you to make one of your first visits, I hope, as Russia’s Prime Minister. We would be very pleased to see you. We have indeed had some good meetings. As far as I know, a protocol has already been signed on air transport links and the situation that saw the end of direct flights between Russia and Georgia will return to normal, I think. I think we are also making progress on the issues concerning supplies of Georgian products to the Russian market, and I hope that we will be able to make some headway here. This is an important political issue for our country. I think there are a number of other issues on which Russia and Georgia should seek rapprochement. We simply must normalise our relations and overcome past problems. We hope to restore the positive trend that we saw at the beginning of my first term in office. If we cannot start afresh, we at least want to give new impetus to our relations. This is something we all desire and hope very much that we can achieve.

Beginning of the Meeting with the President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rakhmon
February 21, 2008
21:24
Novo-Ogaryovo
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Emomali Sharipovich!
First of all, thank you for having accepted our invitation and attending the informal CIS summit.
I would like to begin by immediately expressing our sympathy for the severe climatic conditions that Tajikistan has had to face. I have received your letter in this regard. As you know, we have tried to respond quickly and to send certain types of products that you need above all. I am referring to industrial products: diesel fuel, portable power and things like that. I am ready to discuss in more detail today what Tajikistan needs. And of course we will talk about bilateral relations. I am thinking of our collaboration in the energy sector, the first block of Sangtudin Hydroelectric Power Station began operating in January. I hope that this, too, has played at least some positive role in overcoming the very high winter [electricity consumption] which you are experiencing. And we have other issues to discuss, including military-technical cooperation, military cooperation.
I am very glad to see you. Welcome.
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rakhmon: Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!
I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you.
First of all, I would like to express my sincere words of gratitude for all that you have done for the development of the strategic partnership between Tajikistan and Russia. Thanks to you, our relations have become more harmonious, moved to a qualitatively new stage, and witnessed the implementation of large-scale joint projects in various spheres, projects for which there are no comparisons in the post-Soviet era.
Thank you very much on behalf of the people of Tajikistan for your attention to the tragic events that Tajikistan faced this year. This is the third month of exceptionally cold weather. In the east it is now minus twenty-five. There has never been anything like it in our country's history.
Vladimir Putin: How many years has it been since you had weather like this? You don't remember it ever being so cold?
Emomali Rahmon: Absolutely no one remembers such weather. Well, it has been as cold, but for short periods, two or three days, four days. But this is now in the third month. The situation is catastrophic. According to preliminary estimates, there has been more than a billion dollars damage. The winter crop was completely lost, the horticultural sector was badly hit, and we lost nearly 70 per cent of our livestock. Fully 90 per cent of industry is idle for the third consecutive month. We are supplying electricity to the population: in the capital it's four hours in the morning and four hours in the evening. In the rest of the country there is none. Therefore we were forced to turn to the world community for help. Of course foreign aid will not fundamentally change the situation. It is necessary to build a hydroelectric power station. There is no other way. Tajikistan’s electricity deficit in winter amounts to 20.5 billion kilowatt-hours.

Beginning of Meeting with President of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiev
February 21, 2008
20:16
Novo-Ogaryevo
President of The Russian Federation Vladimir Putin: Kurmanbek Salievich,
Allow me to welcome you to Moscow. First of all, I want to thank you, as President of the CIS, for helping to organise this informal summit here in Russia. I also want to note that our bilateral relations are developing well. It is enough to say that our bilateral trade increased by 40 percent over the last year and exceeded $1 billion. We have good prospects ahead in investment activity, investment in the energy sector and the mining and oil and gas industries. Overall, our relations are growing and I am very pleased to see this. We have plenty to discuss.
President of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiev: Thank you.
Vladimir Vladimirovich,
I would like to reaffirm today that the decisions we made two years ago are being implemented now and are becoming reality. In other words, the agreements we reached and the objectives we outlined at our summit and intergovernmental meetings are being carried out in practice now, and I am also very pleased to see this.
You are absolutely right in noting that our bilateral trade has passed the $1 billion mark (one billion two hundred thousand), but even more important is that Russian business investors are really entering Kyrgyzstan’s economy now and that the first results are already visible. This is pleasing to see and is good news for everyone working with us today.
I think we do indeed have good prospects ahead. The real implementation work we have already carried out puts in place the conditions for our relations, above all in the economy (thankfully we have no problems in any other areas), to produce impressive results. I have no doubt that this will be the case.
