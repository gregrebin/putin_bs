Novo-Ogaryevo
President of The Russian Federation Vladimir Putin:
Ilham Geidarovich,
First of all, I would like to thank you for coming to Moscow to attend this informal summit. Of course, I also want to take this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations. Frankly speaking, there are no real problems in our relations and we have made considerable progress in our economic ties. The increase in our bilateral trade was not as impressive last year as the year before last, but overall the positive dynamic remains strong. We are pleased to see that Russian investors are investing ever more actively in Azerbaijan’s economy, and we are grateful to you for the conditions that your country’s government offers Russian companies. I will not list them all now, they are well known. Our investment activity is developing and our cooperation in the energy sector is also growing stronger. There are several issues I would like to discuss separately with you today. We are very happy to see you here in Moscow. Welcome!
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliev: Thank you, Vladimir Vladimirovich. Thank you for this invitation to visit Moscow and for this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations. I fully agree with you that we have no problems. We are making steady progress in all areas. Our countries are working together very effectively in political, economic and humanitarian cooperation. Overall, our relations, which we see as those of friends and good neighbours, are growing stronger. You noted the good investment climate in Azerbaijan and the fact that Russian companies find a comfortable working environment in our country. They enjoy the same rights as local companies. We welcome increased Russian investment in Azerbaijan. I note too that many companies are now taking part as subcontractors in various construction and infrastructure projects. We are very happy with the level of business relations that has been established. Our business communities look to our countries’ leadership as a reference and rightly so. They see the active political cooperation between our countries and this gives them greater confidence and comfort. Azerbaijani companies are also working on the Russian market and enjoy full rights there. I am satisfied with the way our relations are developing. During today’s meeting I would like to examine bilateral issues and also regional cooperation issues and the events taking place in the world that need to be discussed.

Beginning of Meeting with President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili
February 21, 2008
19:10
Novo-Ogaryevo
President of The Russian Federation Vladimir Putin: Mikhail Nikolayevich,
First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting our invitation and coming to this informal CIS summit. I know that our relations are starting to improve in a number of different areas. We have noted your statements that the Georgian leadership seeks better relations with Russia, and we are very pleased to hear this. We will do our best to reply in kind. I know that our aviation authorities have reached an agreement in principle on settling the differences between them, above all the question of debt settlement. This means we will be able to resume flights between our countries and also settle a number of the other issues that had come up. We have a fair number of problems to address but I think we will able to take advantage of your being here for the CIS summit and discuss all of these different issues today.
President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili: Yes, I think so. First of all, Vladimir Vladimirovich, I am very happy to have been able to come to this summit. This will be the last CIS summit during your term in office and I did not want to miss this occasion.
I regret that you have not yet managed to make a visit to Georgia as President, but I invite you to make one of your first visits, I hope, as Russia’s Prime Minister. We would be very pleased to see you. We have indeed had some good meetings. As far as I know, a protocol has already been signed on air transport links and the situation that saw the end of direct flights between Russia and Georgia will return to normal, I think. I think we are also making progress on the issues concerning supplies of Georgian products to the Russian market, and I hope that we will be able to make some headway here. This is an important political issue for our country. I think there are a number of other issues on which Russia and Georgia should seek rapprochement. We simply must normalise our relations and overcome past problems. We hope to restore the positive trend that we saw at the beginning of my first term in office. If we cannot start afresh, we at least want to give new impetus to our relations. This is something we all desire and hope very much that we can achieve.
