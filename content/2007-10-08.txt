Beginning of Working Meeting with Chairman of the Board of Sberbank Andrei Kazmin

The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: I am listening, Andrei Ilyich.
Andrei Kazmin: I would like to inform you on the results of the bank’s work over these last nine months, and report on the general situation in the banking sector. With the exception of August, the situation in the third quarter was positive overall. We achieved a considerable increase in our financial results (here, on page three, you can see our net profit). According to our operational data, our net profit stood at more than 80 billion roubles as at October 1.
Vladimir Putin: 87 billion.
Andrei Kazmin: This figure, 87.9 billion, was the result as at January 1 for the entire year. Our result for the first nine months of this year is just slightly behind last year’s overall figure.
We had a profit target for this year – the target was around 100 billion. We have every reason to hope that, despite the various negative trends on the market, we will be able to meet this target. As you can see, we have also achieved our target for capital. Overall then, the results of the first three quarters give us reason to expect a positive financial result for the year as a whole.
This graph shows the development of the bank’s branch network. We have paid a lot of attention to modernising the bank’s internal structural subdivisions. They have increased in number this year. The focus has been on the cities with the biggest shortage of banking services. We are currently in the process of completing work on a programme to develop alternative means of banking service provision. By this I mean various self-service facilities such as automatic exchange facilities, automatic teller machines and banking terminals. This will make it possible to lighten the work of overburdened branches and better satisfy our customers’ needs.
Efforts to attract resources have gone ahead dynamically. The diagram shows that, as in past years, household savings continue to form the bulk of our resources and they continued to increase over the third quarter. The bank had attracted resources totalling more than 3780 billion roubles (3.8 trillion roubles) as at October 1. This is a huge amount and we bear great responsibility for ensuring that this money is used effectively.

Beginning of Working Meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin and Economic Development and Trade Minister Elvira Nabiullina
October 8, 2007
19:32
The Kremlin, Moscow
Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov: Vladimir Vladimirovich, you have just had a meeting with the chairman of the board of Sberbank, Andrei Ilyich Kazmin. He has held this post for a long time now, around 12 years, and I think he has done a good job. Given his great experience, I want to propose bringing him into the Government and giving him an important mission – that of modernising and developing the Russian Postal Service. If you have no objection, I would like to meet with him and discuss this with him.
President Vladimir Putin: Yes, the bank has achieved some good results indeed, and Mr Kazmin’s capable work as director and that of the bank’s management has certainly contributed to this success. This is true.
Regarding the Russian Postal Service, this is an enormous organisation with 400,000 employees and 40,000 branches – a network twice the size of Sberbank’s network. We do indeed need someone here who would be able to carry out all the work needed to develop the postal service, and I am ready to discuss this matter with the Chairman of the Central Bank.
I have no objections.
Viktor Zubkov: Thank you.
