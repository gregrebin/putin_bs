With President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Turkmenistan is among our strategic partners in the region. This is secured through our core documents and we can see it working in practice. We have very good relations in politics, humanitarian cooperation and the economy. Granted, in monetary terms, trade volume fell slightly, but we have reasonable commodity flows.
As for concerns from our friends in the region about the use of airspace above the Caspian Sea, our Kazakhstani friends have not said anything about this yet, but we will keep it in mind. We understand that there are probably limitations and it creates a certain inconvenience, but we all know that all of Russia’s efforts in the fight against terrorism are primarily a burden on the Russian Federation, economically speaking. Terrorist organisations like the Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra and others do not spare anyone. They are engaged in true atrocities, and they do not spare civilian targets, such as civilian aircraft. So if any inconveniences are created, they should certainly be minimised, and we will keep this in mind.
However, given our tragic experience with the destruction of our aircraft, we will do this for as long as we feel it is necessary, to punish the guilty. Still, all these operations will not go on forever; I stated earlier that they will be temporary and linked to the offensive operations by the Syrian army to suppress terrorist organisations. Inevitably, the Syrian crisis must still be resolved and will be resolved by political means.
We very much hope that the process underway in Vienna will lead to a positive result. Just today, we were discussing this with the Iranian leadership. I think that all our friends, close allies and strategic partners not only understand this, but will also support us. We very much count on it.
As for humanitarian cooperation, we consider it highly important. You just mentioned the school we established together, and the film festival showing our films. And I remember what a pleasure it was to welcome your musicians who shared the traditional musical arts of Turkmenistan. Their performances enjoyed great popularity. We very much hope that this cooperation in all areas will continue. We respect Turkmenistan’s neutral status and support it in various ways. Naturally, we will participate in the events you are planning.
I also want to thank you for your invitation, which I will certainly accept. Thank you very much.

Gas Exporting Countries Forum summit
Vladimir Putin took part in the Gas Exporting Countries Forum summit.

Gas Exporting Countries Forum summit.
Speech at the plenary session of the Third Summit of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chairman, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
Close cooperation between gas producers and suppliers is an increasingly important factor in global energy’s stable development today. Over these last 14 years, the Gas Exporting Countries Forum has become a solidly established international organisation that helps the gas producing countries to work together to promote their interests on the global markets.
The forum’s participating countries account for the vast majority of the world’s proven natural gas reserves (79 percent, or 85 percent if we count the observer countries), and supply nearly half of the gas traded on world markets.
Our countries and our national companies are investing huge amounts of money in long-term gas exploration, production, processing and transportation projects. In this way, we make a major contribution to the world’s energy security and to steady global economic development.
The agreements reached at the previous summit in Moscow made it possible to increase considerably our countries’ coordination on strategic gas sector development issues and laid the foundations for developing common approaches to fair price formation and equal distribution of risks between energy suppliers and consumers.
I am sure that today’s meeting will be just as productive and the decisions set out in the final declaration will give a new boost to our cooperation and make our common efforts to improve the international gas trade even more effective.
In this respect, I think the theme ‘Natural gas is the best fuel for sustainable growth’, which our Iranian partners have proposed as the main discussion theme at this summit, is particularly relevant today.
Gas is the most affordable, economically advantageous and environmentally friendly energy source. Growth in global demand for gas outstrips demand for oil and other energy sources. Forecasts show that by 2040, global gas demand will increase by 32 percent to nearly 5 trillion cubic metres. I remind you that demand in 2014 came to 3.7 trillion cubic metres.
This opens up big opportunities for developing gas production and export, and it also raises a serious challenge, because we will need to speed up dramatically the development of new fields, modernise processing facilities and expand the gas transport infrastructure, bringing on line new pipelines and organising extensive routes for liquefied natural gas supply.
These ambitious plans require largescale investment, which can take decades to bring a return. Investors will need firm and clear guarantees, of course. Most importantly, however, the future gas consumers and gas producers should take an equal share in investment risks. Everyone has to pay for energy security – exporter countries and consumer countries. This is fair and in keeping with the spirit of market relations.
We know that modern technology and business models are changing the way the gas market is organised in the world. Stock market trading methods and spot mechanisms are increasingly used to establish prices today.
Last year, we in Russia, for example, began gas trading on the St Petersburg Commodities exchange. Trade came to 6.8 billion cubic metres over less than a year, and we have plans to bring this up to 35 billion cubic metres a year. At the same time, Gazprom, our leading company, sold 17 billion cubic metres of gas in spot trading – more than 8 percent of its total sales.
What I want to stress though is that in the interest of a stable and predictable market, as we continue working to attract investment into the gas sector, we should under no circumstance abandon the tried and tested practice of long-term contracts and the ‘take and pay’ principle. I think it important that the forum’s participating countries show solidarity on this issue.
Colleagues, in our draft national Energy Strategy through to 2035, which we are currently working on, we have planned for a considerable increase in natural gas production – by 40 percent. In 2014, we produced 578 billion cubic metres, and by 2035, we plan to produce 885 billion cubic metres.
We plan to carry out a number of infrastructure projects with our partners from the European Union, and are working with Turkey on settling the southern transport route. Our country will also export gas and increase supplies to Asia, and in this region, we have very positive work underway with our Asian partners – with China, India and other partners. We plan to increase supplies to Asia from 6 percent to 30 percent – up to 128 billion cubic metres.
We will increase production of liquefied natural gas to 60 million tonnes. This will take us from today’s 4 percent of the global LNG market to 13 percent. In this area, we have planned a number of projects in Russia’s eastern and northern regions and in the Russian Far East.
I am completely confident that Russia can carry out all of these plans successfully. Our country is up to this task. At the same time, we are ready for the closest cooperation with our partners in the Gas Exporting Countries Forum and with other interested countries in order to satisfy global energy demand and ensure sustainable global economic development in general.
Thank you very much for your attention.

The sides also signed a contract on the design, supply of materials and equipment, and construction for the Garmsar-Incheborun railway section electrification project, a contract agreement to build a thermal power plant consisting of four 350 MW power blocs and a desalination plant in the Hormozgan Province, as well as a core contract to fulfil works to find and assess deep groundwater reserves on Iran’s territory.
Vladimir Putin and Hassan Rouhani
made a statement to the press.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
The Gas Exporting Countries Forum summit was a good chance to talk not only about developing the sector and its current state, but also an opportunity for extensive meetings with Iranian leadership.
We held substantial talks with the President of Iran with participation by the heads of key ministries, agencies and business representatives. These talks were a continuation of our politically intense discussion with the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was held this morning.
During the meetings, we had detailed conversations on the full range of our relations in the economy, coordination on the international arena and fighting international terrorism.
You saw that we just signed an extensive package of documents that is designed to encourage interaction in a range of areas. We intend to increase the momentum of our trade ties and will give the necessary attention to expanding product diversification and broader use of our national currencies in mutual settlements.
The Eurasian Economic Union will start examining the possibility of creating a free trade zone with Iran. We will intensify industrial cooperation as well. Russia is ready to allocate a state export credit of $5 billion for this purpose. About 35 priority projects in energy, construction, marine terminals, electricity generation, railways, and other areas have been selected.
We will continue mutually beneficial cooperation in nuclear energy. The first unit of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is already at full capacity, and work has begun on the second and third unit.
We will provide maximum assistance to implement a corresponding action plan within the framework of the Iranian nuclear programme, approved in July by the UN Security Council. Among other things, we will help process enriched uranium and convert manufacturing plants to create stable isotopes for research purposes.
We will continue coordination in the fight against terrorism and strengthen cooperation within the framework of the International Group on Syria, including in order to carry out decisions on launching a comprehensive intra-Syrian political process.
As for the outcomes of the meeting between Gas Exporting Countries Forum leaders, Mr Rouhani already held a detailed news conference on this topic today. I would like to congratulate our friends on successfully holding this major international event and add at this news conference that Russia intends to increase the volume of gas production by 40 percent by 2035.
In conclusion, I would like to thank our Iranian partners and friends for the invitation, and Mr President for inviting me to the event, and for the warm atmosphere that was created during our joint work.
Thank you.
(Answering a journalist's question on the situation in Syria.)
Vladimir Putin: I have a positive assessment of our pilots’ work. Today, I informed our Iranian friends about these matters and we exchanged views on the situation in Syria.
As for our troops’ actions, this is a complex operation involving major satellite support and various air force resources. These include attack planes, bombers, strategic missile-carrying bombers, fighter jets that are covering them, and two fleet groupings in the Caspian and Mediterranean seas, including missile carriers which are striking from the Caspian Sea basin. Naturally, all this is done in agreement with our Iranian partners; I think it would simply be impossible without their participation.
This is complicated, extensive work in coordination and technology maintenance, which serves as evidence of our officers’ and troops’ high level of training. These efforts are bringing positive results and our joint assessment was constructive. But I want to say again that there is no other option for resolving the Syrian problem in the long-term other than through political negotiations.
Thank you.

Meeting with President of Bolivia Evo Morales.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends, I am very happy to meet with you.
This year, we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. Although we cannot boast of a large trade volume, we nevertheless have good prospects.
Your nation is one of the world’s biggest gas producers, and you have good reserves. Gazprom is already working in your country and planning to extract gas next year.
But Gazprom is not the only company that is showing interest in your country. There is interest in the fields of energy, engineering and certain high-tech sectors. We are prepared to work together with you in military technology cooperation as well.
I am happy to see you.
President of Bolivia Evo Morales
(retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us.
Our people express our condolences following the recent tragic events and our hearts are with you.
We look towards the future with great hope and a great deal of trust, and expect to further develop our relations and agreements. Gazprom representatives have already met with representatives from the Hydrocarbons and Energy Ministry as well as our companies.
But right now, we have another important issue: the issue of cooperating with Rosatom. For our part, we are providing investments. We will create a major centre in our country for studying nuclear technologies; it will have cutting-edge equipment, a research reactor, a cyclotron and gamma ray facilities. And I would like to note that we will use Russian technologies, while providing $300 million of financing. This will be the largest centre in all of South America.
Vladimir Putin: I know about this project and we will certainly support it on a government level.
