Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cordially welcome you to Moscow.
The Russian delegations that visited your country a year ago have warm memories of the reception given to them and we would like your visit to Russia to proceed in a similar pleasant and friendly atmosphere.
We are very pleased to note that despite the intense political life in your country during the unfolding election campaign, those whose position is above political parties have decided not to put off the state visit to Russia.
The relations between Russia and Germany have recently seen many positive changes. They have acquired a pronounced pragmatic character. Bilateral trade has increased by almost 80% since 2000. It reached a record figure of 20 billion euros last year.
Last year we achieved an agreement on some difficult issues, including in the credit and financial sphere. One such issue is transferable roubles. Neither German experts nor ourselves were sure if we would ever be able to resolve that problem. And you know that Russia has already paid 175 million euros. And we were to pay another 175 million at the end of the year, but we decided to pay ahead of schedule and do it immediately in August considering our financial potential. And, as we say in Russia, “A spoon is dear at dinnertime”. We assumed that German Government needed the money to address the problems connected with natural disasters. I don’t know the exact figure, but I think Europe has offered Germany 50 million before the end of the year, and I think 175 million from Russia will also come handy.
This is more proof of Russia’s credit rating and the character of relations between Russia and Germany. It shows that we have settled all the problems and can develop our relations in a very positive way starting from a clean slate.
Mr President, we are very pleased to receive the German head of state in Russia. My colleagues and I say, “Welcome”.
