Opening Remarks at a Meeting with German President Johannes Rau

The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cordially welcome you to Moscow.
The Russian delegations that visited your country a year ago have warm memories of the reception given to them and we would like your visit to Russia to proceed in a similar pleasant and friendly atmosphere.
We are very pleased to note that despite the intense political life in your country during the unfolding election campaign, those whose position is above political parties have decided not to put off the state visit to Russia.
The relations between Russia and Germany have recently seen many positive changes. They have acquired a pronounced pragmatic character. Bilateral trade has increased by almost 80% since 2000. It reached a record figure of 20 billion euros last year.
Last year we achieved an agreement on some difficult issues, including in the credit and financial sphere. One such issue is transferable roubles. Neither German experts nor ourselves were sure if we would ever be able to resolve that problem. And you know that Russia has already paid 175 million euros. And we were to pay another 175 million at the end of the year, but we decided to pay ahead of schedule and do it immediately in August considering our financial potential. And, as we say in Russia, “A spoon is dear at dinnertime”. We assumed that German Government needed the money to address the problems connected with natural disasters. I don’t know the exact figure, but I think Europe has offered Germany 50 million before the end of the year, and I think 175 million from Russia will also come handy.
This is more proof of Russia’s credit rating and the character of relations between Russia and Germany. It shows that we have settled all the problems and can develop our relations in a very positive way starting from a clean slate.
Mr President, we are very pleased to receive the German head of state in Russia. My colleagues and I say, “Welcome”.

Opening Remarks at a Joint Meeting with German President Johannes Rau with the Russian Managers Trained in Germany
September 3, 2002
23:55
The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.
We are pleased to welcome the President of Germany and all the colleagues who have come together with him to Russia.
I don’t think this audience needs to be reminded of the importance of relations between Russia and Germany for Russia and for the European community in general. Germany is one of our major partners in the economic and political spheres.
A short while ago, opening an enlarged meeting, I said that our trade has grown by 80% in the last two years, a bigger increase than with any other country. And it is a considerable sum in absolute figures, 25 billion euros.
Germany is a major investor in the Russian economy, over 6 billion euros, but Germany is only the fifth largest investor and that means you have your job cut out for you.
By the way, one of the current problems is modern effective management. And I am pleased to note that 30% of those who have been trained in Germany now work at joint ventures. It is a very good result. It shows that the efforts both of the Russian and above all the German side have not been in vain. All these efforts are aimed at developing cooperation between the economies of Russia and Germany.
Germany is our traditional economic partner. It has always been so: “before historical materialism”, and after 1917, and especially in the past decade. German businessmen are actively moving into our market and they pursue a sound long-term policy. These are not people out to make “quick bucks” in Russia. German capital is financial capital, industrial capital, and that is very important.
Of course, as I have said, it puts a high premium on effective managers. This programme of training must continue and evolve. The training of our specialists in Western countries is important, but Western specialists must understand what conditions they will work in and have a feel of the specific environment in which they will operate, with all the minuses and pluses. Of course, there are many minuses here, but the prospects are also good. And we hope that the future is in safe hands.
