Speech at official breakfast hosted by President of the Federative Republic of Brazil Dilma Rousseff in honour of President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
President of Russia VLADIMIR PUTIN: Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to sincerely thank our Brazilian colleagues for their friendly, warm welcome and the exceptionally constructive atmosphere of today’s talks which, I am certain, fully reflected the spirit of mutual understanding that has developed between our nations.
Last year marked the 185th anniversary since the establishment of diplomatic ties between Russia and Brazil. From the very beginning, they were built on the principles of cooperation and respect for one another’s interests. And today, after almost two centuries, our cooperation serves as an example of openness and equality.
We consider the development of a strategic partnership with Brazil to hold particular, priority significance. During our talks, I once again ascertained that our Brazilian friends also intend to strengthen ties with Russia and cooperate closely with us in the global arena, including within the framework of the UN, the G20, and other international organisations. Our nations hold similar positions on key international problems and we jointly assert the principles of a multipolar world.
Russia and Brazil have truly colossal economic potential. Our assets already include a whole range of successful investment projects, including in energy, engineering and pharmaceuticals. But of course, we are interested in going further and deepening industrial cooperation in high-tech sectors such as IT, biotechnologies, aircraft engineering and air and space. We are prepared to create the most comfortable conditions possible for Brazilian companies to operate in the Russian market.
”We consider the development of a strategic partnership with Brazil to hold particular, priority significance. Our nations hold similar positions on key international problems and we jointly assert the principles of a multipolar world.“
The full-fledged development of bilateral ties is impossible without fruitful humanitarian contacts, including, of course, in sports, as Madame President just mentioned. The Football World Cup concluded yesterday, and Brazil, as an organising country and the host, raised the bar for organising this event. And we will need to do a great deal to maintain that standard [when we host the World Cup in 2018].
We recently hosted the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. Brazil will be hosting the Sumer Olympics in 2016. We are confident that this event will also be held at a high level; and Russia, based on your experience, dear friends, will do everything possible to hold the 2018 Football World Cup to meet the standards of football fans throughout the world.
It is clear that we have much to learn from one another. But we already share a truly athletic disposition that allows us to overcome temporary setbacks and difficulties and to achieve the goals we set.
We are prepared to work closely in areas of interest to our peoples and states. I am confident that we can do a great deal by combining our efforts.
Just now, Madame President was telling me about her nation, Brazil, in an informal setting with such love and explaining Brazil’s development plans with such passion that I have absolutely no doubt everything will be implemented. We sincerely wish for you to be successful.
Please let me propose a toast to the friendship between our nations and peoples! To the health of Madame President and everyone present!
