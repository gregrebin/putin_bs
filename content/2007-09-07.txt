Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of Russia's becoming a fullfledged member of APEC. It was a committed and strategic choice for us, based on objective economic factors and geopolitical circumstances. Life itself has since then convincingly demonstrated that the decision made then was timely and well-founded.
Today, on the eve of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Sydney I would like to share with you my vision of the prospects for Russia's participation in this influential regional association.
APEC has entered the 21st century as a major and authoritative regional structure with a uniquely broad membership of countries situated on both sides of the Pacific. Represented in it are Asia, the Eastern American continent and the Southern Pacific. Russia has been successfully cooperating within its framework.
Due to the rapid development of the Asia-Pacific Region, APEC can be called the most promising economic association of the planet. Even now the Member States of the Forum account for 57percent of the world's gross domestic product, 48percent of world trade and over 40percent of direct foreign investments. And according to expert estimates, these figures may go up in the coming years. Such a prospect is also held out by APEC’s basic priorities aimed at improving the trade environment in the Asia-Pacific Region as well as broadening regional integration.
Active and multifaceted participation in the work of APEC is becoming an increasingly important aspect of Russia's foreign policy on its eastern frontiers. Accordingly, our interaction with the Forum has been growing every year. For instance, APEC's share in Russia's foreign trade has increased now to reach 18.1percent including up to 16.6percent in Russian exports. Such influential APEC members as China and USA are among our top ten partners, and if combined with Japan, they are among the top ten leaders of investment cooperation with Russia.
Our key task is to make use of APEC's possibilities so that Russia could join the Asia–Pacific integration mechanisms in a most effective and efficient way. This naturally complements Russia's national plans for social and economic development. Top priority is given to projects of intensive development of Siberia and the Far East. Alarge scale modernization of leading economic sectors, industrial and transportation infrastructure is being pursued, notably, by the Program for the Development of the Far East and Trans-Baikal Regions, i.e. the areas that directly belong to the Asia–Pacific Region.
Russia has officially stated its readiness to chair APEC in 2012. And it is not by chance that we have suggested that the Associations' Summit be held in the eastern part of our country– in the city of Vladivostok. We believe that this meeting will allow a detailed discussion of the future of the Asia–Pacific Region and its progress towards a sustainable and stable development.
I would like to emphasize that this would not be the first time that important APEC events have taken place in the Russian Far East. We have hosted a major APEC Investment Fair as well as meetings of the APEC Working Groups on Transportation, Energy, Industrial Science and Technology. An active and substantive dialogue took place during the First Asia-Pacific Congress that focused on deepening business links between the Russian Federation and APEC.
We are confident that Russia's presidency of APEC can be of great benefit both for our partners and us, primarily in terms of further strengthening mutually beneficial business links and the free trade space as well as in deploying innovative technologies. It would make a substantial contribution to the development of regional and world cooperation and provide an incentive for bilateral and multilateral cooperation between the APEC economies.
It is evident that APEC’s current activities go beyond addressing economic problems only. The task of countering threats and challenges in the area of development remains relevant. It includes neutralizing terrorism, preventing natural calamities and manmade disasters as well as epidemics. The problem of corruption and money laundering continues to be a serious obstacle on the way to economic stability in the APEC region.
The Russian Federation is consistently strengthening its positions in these important spheres of regional cooperation. Our country has been making a notable contribution to APEC counter-terrorism activities. This year, for example, we have put forward an initiative to set up a system to protect critical energy infrastructure facilities against terrorist attacks. We actively cooperate with the other Forum Member States in elaborating joint steps to cut off financial channels feeding terrorists and to counter corruption. Finally, starting from last year our country has been co-sponsoring a broad dialogue between civilizations within APEC. This dialogue is meant to protect our societies, particularly the youth, from xenophobia, ethnic or religious intolerance.
Russia pioneered here the work on managing the consequences of natural and manmade emergencies and designing a system of information sharing and coordinated action in case of epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.
Moreover, we have unswervingly supported the progress towards regional energy security based on partnership beneficial for everyone.
We believe that strengthening interaction between APEC official and business circles is of utmost importance. Russia has vigorously supported the industrial dialogue on nonferrous metals engaging businesspeople from 12APEC countries. By all accounts, its threeyear work was mutually beneficial and made it possible to achieve serious progress in creating more favorable conditions for the relevant APEC markets. Now, this dialogue is being reshaped to a new, more powerful institution with a broader scope, whose activities, I hope, will be as effective.
The effort of CEOs of large Russian companies within the APEC Business Consultative Council is also worth paying close attention to. The constructive cooperation between the Council and Forum is being consistently and steadily strengthened, bringing together the interests of the private and public sectors. Iam referring to the promising joint work that has a direct practical effect on the development of the participating economies.
* * *
In conclusion, I would like to stress once again that Russia strives to actively broaden its participation in APEC. It is of fundamental importance to us that all activities of this association are carried out on the basis of consensus and discretion in the implementation of the decisions made, as consistent with one's national interests. It is this very approach that both secures regional progress and allows each participant to address the specific tasks it has set for itself.
The focus of the current summit in Sydney – Strengthening our Community, Building a Sustainable Future – fully lives up to the logic of the APR economic development which is based on consolidating mutually beneficial cooperation, expanding large-scale trade and investment, and strengthening common security. I am convinced that the meeting of the APEC leaders in Australia will contribute to the achievement of these strategic goals, the main one consisting in ensuring a sustainable and predictable future for all countries and peoples of the region.

Press Statement Following the Meeting with American President George W. Bush
September 7, 2007
18:31
Sydney
President Vladimir Putin: First of all, I would like to say that I am very glad to have the opportunity to meet with the U.S. President within the framework of the APEC summit. And I began our meeting today with words of gratitude for the very warm welcome we received during our recent visit to Kennebunkport.
We talked about various matters on our bilateral agenda and about important international problems, first and foremost, about missile defence. We noted that it is necessary that our experts meet again very soon and make another trip to the Gabala radar station in Azerbaijan. We can, therefore, see that joint work in this direction is continuing.
We discussed Russia's WTO accession plans. We hope that this work will have positive results and that work at the expert level will continue.
We also talked about the Iranian nuclear problem. I would like to say that Russia intends to continue to work with our partners and colleagues within the framework of the IAEA and the United Nations. We hope that we can find a solution for the benefit of the both: international community and of the Iranian people.
We also covered our economic relations. We discussed various major economic projects whose implementation is in the interests of both countries' business communities.
We also discussed environmental issues, particularly in light of the forthcoming APEC summit. I must say that our positions on this issue are very close.
I would like to thank the President of the United States for today's very constructive and open dialogue. This gives me reason to believe that our countries relations will develop in a similarly positive way in the future.
Thank you.
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Vladimir, thanks. For a minute, I thought he brought up the Kennebunkport visit to remind me that he was the only one who caught the fish. But in fact, it was our — my family's great pleasure to welcome my friend the President of Russia to Mother and Dad's home.
I have nothing much more to add than what Vladimir said. We did discuss a variety of issues that are of importance to our respective countries, and I found the conversation to be cordial and constructive. We are results-oriented people. We want to help solve problems. And we recognize that we can do better solving problems when we work together.
So I appreciate your time, appreciate your friendship, and appreciate the chance to dialogue on important matters.
President Putin: And we also agreed that we will go fishing not only in the United States but also in a Siberian river at some point.

Speech at an Official Breakfast Hosted by Australia’s Prime Minister John Howard
September 7, 2007
20:33
Sydney
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Prime Minister, Mrs Howard, ladies and gentlemen.
I want to say first how delighted we are to have this wonderful chance to visit your country. We have been greatly impressed by the goodwill and hospitality of Australians and, of course, by the unique colours of the natural world in your country, and by the sophisticated creations wrought by human hands. All that we have seen has been done in a relatively short period of time, and done on such a scale, with such good taste. I am sure that this first state visit by a Russian president will help stimulate a whole range of bilateral cooperation initiatives. Our mutual efforts have enabled us to open a new chapter in our partnership.
Exactly one month from today Russia and Australia will celebrate the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. It is well known that the historical links between our peoples go much farther back. Both Prime Minister Howard and the leader of the opposition have spoken about the history of our relations. Different people from Russia have visited Australia at different times. Even Prime Minister Kerensky, the Head of the Provisional Government [in 1917], visited here. Even more surprising is the fact that he went on to marry an Australian journalist. This is a sort of unnatural union, even for a former Prime Minister. I don’t know exactly why he did it. Perhaps he was overcome by grief after losing power, in a state of temporary insanity. Or maybe this is just the result of some internal disposition that led him from one mistake to another: first he lost power, then he lost it again.
But, in addition to Mr Kerensky, many distinguished Russian travelers such as Bellingshausen, Lazarev, Kruzenshtern, and Vasilev have visited here. I know that in your country there is still great respect for Nikolai Nikolaevich Miklouho Maclay, a distinguished [nineteenth-century] Russian scholar who passionately loved Australia.
Thanks namely to such bright, talented, courageous people and their interest in the new and the unknown, Russians have long had a lively interest in your wonderful country. Today this interest provides the basis for a profound mutual understanding and the rapprochement of our nations. In Russia we will never forget the glorious and heroic pages of our history, which have already been mentioned here. I mean our alliance during World War II. In our country we recall with profound gratitude the achievements of Australian veterans and their contribution to the defeat of Nazism.
Today we admire the extraordinary perseverance and hard work of Australians. In a relatively short period you have succeeded in creating a dynamic and prosperous nation, a country in which a modern economy and high-tech industry coexist harmoniously with traditional structures, a country that cherishes its historical, cultural, and ethnographic heritage by conserving all of its diversity.
Your country is very like our Russian homeland. For centuries people of different nationalities and faiths have lived there. Russia is organically linked with the West and East. In historical terms we are allied to the traditions of our pan-European home and to the vast Asia-Pacific region.
Here in the Asia-Pacific region large and promising prospects for cooperation are opening up. Russia is ready to actively cooperate with Australia in the international arena, including within the framework of the APEC forum, whose summit the Prime Minister and I will be attending tomorrow. The results of meetings and talks have confirmed the proximity of our positions on energy security and trade links. An extensive range of opportunities for cooperation is opening up in the areas of culture, education and science.
Once again I want to emphasize that the current visit is just the beginning of a great movement that will bring Russia and Australia closer together, help achieve new and specific results, and bring to fruition joint plans and initiatives for the benefit of our two peoples.
Unfortunately, in our large delegation there are no representatives of the opposition, although we do have an opposition in Russia. Moreover, ours is a presidential not a parliamentary republic. Therefore, permit me to have the audacity to speak for the whole Russian people in wishing all our Australian friends prosperity and every success, and in expressing my hopes for the development of our future relations. Thank you.
