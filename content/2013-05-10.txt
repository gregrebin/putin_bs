Meeting with UK Prime Minister David Cameron
May 10, 2013
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen,
We have just had very substantial talks with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron. In both narrow and extended format meetings we discussed the opportunities for developing our bilateral relations. We also gave particular attention to current international issues and agreed to coordinate our work within the G20 and the G8, in which Russia and Britain currently hold the presidencies. What’s more, Russia will take over the presidency of the G8 from Britain in 2014.
Our trade, economic and investment cooperation is growing. Our bilateral trade increased by 10 percent in 2012, and it was up by almost 30 percent in the first two months of 2013. British investment in the Russian economy is also on the rise and now comes to almost $27 billion.
The energy sector is one of the most promising fields of cooperation. We agreed to establish a special group to work on promising projects and facilities. As you know, one of Britain’s biggest companies, British Petroleum, has acquired an almost 20-percent stake in Rosneft, one of Russia’s biggest oil and gas companies.
In 2014, we plan to hold reciprocal culture years. The events will include art exhibitions in Moscow and London, a Russian language and education week in the UK, a university rectors’ conference, and a theatre festival.
I also want to note our Olympics cooperation. Britain’s experience has been of great use to us in this area. More than 60 British companies are taking part in the preparations for the Sochi Olympics and are working with great success. We want to thank our British partners for that.
Of course, we also had a thorough discussion of international issues, especially the situation in Syria. We both want to see a swift end to the violence and the start of a peace process, and we both want to preserve Syria’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. At the UK Prime Minister’s initiative, we discussed the possible scenarios that could bring about positive development of this process, and examined the possible joint steps we could take.
In conclusion, I want to thank once more our British colleagues and Mr Cameron for this substantial and very frank discussion.
Thank you.
Prime Minister of The United Kingdom David Cameron
: Thank you very much, Mr President, and thank you for the warm welcome that you’ve given to me and my team here today. I’m very pleased to be here with you in Sochi, and we have had, as you said, very substantive, very purposeful, very useful talks today. We last met at the London Olympics, and it’s fitting that we’re here in the next host city. And I’m looking forward to seeing the Olympic sites with you this afternoon.
Britain and Russia share many interests: security at home and abroad, leadership in the G8, the G20 and the United Nations, and also, building our businesses and our investment banks so that we both thrive in the global race. Of course, it’s no secret that there are issues where we differ. We don’t duck these; we’ve had very frank discussions, as we have today. But a more effective relationship will help make people in both our countries safer and better off. And that is what we’ve been focusing on today.
On the Winter Olympics, on my last visit to Russia, I brought a plane of British business leaders keen to seize the opportunities posed by these games, and they have, as you said, done just that, with over fifty companies involved, from Populous to help design the main stadium, to Aggreko, who will be providing some of the power. We’ve also discussed how we both want the Sochi Games to be safe and secure Games. So today, I’ve agreed with President Putin that there should be limited cooperation between our security services for the Sochi Olympics.
We’ve discussed the G8 and G20, and I was pleased to get President Putin’s support for using the Lough Erne Summit to grasp the key challenges of making the world economy work for everyone, supporting global trade, tackling aggressive tax avoidance and tax evasion, and encouraging greater transparency. We’ve also agreed to use the G8 and G20 to build momentum for a WTO deal to cut bureaucracy at borders. This could add up to 70 billion dollars a year to global GDP.
Finally, we discussed the appalling and deteriorating situation in Syria. 80,000 lives lost, millions more fleeing their homes. The history of Syria is being written in the blood of her people. It’s no secret that we have had differing views on how best to handle the situation. But we share fundamental aims: to end the conflict, to stop Syria fragmenting, to let the Syrian people choose who governs them and to prevent the growth of violent extremism. So I strongly support the conference that Mr Lavrov and Mr Kerry agreed this week to deliver a political solution – a solution which has a transitional government based on the consent of the Syrian people as a whole. The President and I have agreed that as permanent members of the UN, we must help to drive this process, working with partners in the region and beyond, not just bringing the regime and opposition together at one negotiating table, but Britain, Russia, America and other countries helping shape a transitional government that all Syrians can trust to protect them.
We urgently have to do more for the sake of people in Syria to break the vicious cycle that threatens to destroy Syria and that threatens to export violence and extremism around the world. As the President said, these have been good talks, purposeful talks. I believe we’ve made some real progress. And thank you again for the welcome you’ve given me today.

Speech ahead of gala match
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends,
I sincerely welcome all participants and guests to the second major national competition between amateur ice hockey teams.
I am very pleased that this initiative by the so-called Night Hockey League was supported by all hockey fans so actively. The first tournament last year was attended by 92 teams from 64 regions around the nation. This year’s competition hosted 124 teams.
Today, we have many hundreds, over 900 amateur hockey teams in our country. Millions of our people want to be strong, healthy and successful.
It is great to see that our women and young ladies have begun playing hockey more and more actively. Last year, we had twelve women’s teams. I am certain this number will continue to grow.
And we are seeing ever greater, more significant results from our hockey players in the international arena. As you know, the world championship is currently underway in Sweden and Finland. We wish our national team success.
Very soon, in just nine months, this platform will welcome participants in the Olympic Games. We are happy that we will have the opportunity to welcome the best teams in the world here – just as, for the first and I hope not the last time, this tournament warmly welcomes sports and hockey lovers, as well as amateur hockey team representatives, from abroad.
I want to thank all hockey fans. and those who have come today to the stadium. Good luck to all our hockey players, both amateur and professional.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin:
Mr Prime Minister, colleagues,
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Russia. Thank you for accepting our invitation to come to Sochi. I am sure that we will have the opportunity today to discuss our bilateral relations and look at the major issues on the international agenda too. If you have time, I would also like to show you how we are getting ready for the 2014 Olympic Games.
I remember how you so kindly accompanied me during the judo events at the London Olympics, and I would like to return that hospitality today and show you around the sites we have built for the 2014 Olympics.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome!
Prime Minister of The United Kingdom David Cameron
: Well, thank you very much, Mr President. It’s a great pleasure to be back in Russia and a pleasure to be working with you on improving British-Russian relations, which both you and I, have put a long time into making stronger.
I well remember your visit to the Olympic games and the visit to the judo. And I wanted to come and see the preparations for the games here in Sochi, which I am sure will be a great success. And I am proud that some British companies are helping to provide the facilities.
As you say, today is an opportunity to talk about our bilateral relations, our trading relations, how we improve those. But it’s also an opportunity to talk about some wider issues including the crisis in Syria. And I look forward to discussing all of these things with you today.
I come here with a view, that I know that you share, that stronger British-Russian relations can make our peoples both safer, and also our economies more prosperous.
And I look forward to welcome you back in the United Kingdom for the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland very, very shortly.
Thank you for your welcome today.
