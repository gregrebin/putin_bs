The Kremlin, Moscow
President Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr Premier, dear friends,
Allow me to wish you a warm welcome to Moscow.
Mr Premier, this is your first official visit to our country, and I want to say that I hope, and am sure, that it will be a very successful one.
Relations with the People’s Republic of China are developing excellently and very intensively in all areas. We are not just united by historical friendship, but by an understanding of common approaches to the developing of world processes of the 21st century.
We are very happy that trade turnover is increasing. We are achieving all the goals set: this year turnover will be around $17-$20 million. And our military and technical cooperation, which is undoubtedly unprecedented in its level and quality, shows the quality of our non-governmental relations.
My colleagues and I are preparing to make a visit to the People’s Republic of China in autumn this year, in October, and we see your visit today as an important step in the development of our cooperation.
