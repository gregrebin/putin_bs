President Vladimir Putin: Welcome, Robert Serdakovich, I am happy to see you.
First of all, before we begin our discussions, I would like to thank you for the attention you gave the Year of Russia in Armenia. We will be expecting you in Moscow soon to join us in taking the next step together and opening the Year of Armenia in Russia. These events show just how intensively our relations are developing. Our trade is also on the rise and in all other areas, too, we are maintaining contacts at the highest level.
I am very glad to see you. Welcome!
President of Armenia Robert Kocharian: Thank you very much for this opportunity to meet, Vladimir Vladimirovich.
This has indeed been an interesting year for the development of our bilateral relations. The year has been rich in cultural and humanitarian events, but at the same time we have also seen growth in our trade and investment activity. This has been a significant year overall for our relations and I hope that next year we will be able to maintain the pace we have set over the course of these last 12 months. What I would note above all is that, with regards to our humanitarian and cultural relations, I think that we could draw up some real systematic approaches for our relations in this area, along the lines of what we have already developed in the economy, in military-technical cooperation and in cooperation between our foreign ministries in terms of formulating coordinated positions.
I am very grateful to the attention and effort Russia put into helping to organise what was indeed a very interesting programme of events over the course of the Year of Russia in Armenia.
