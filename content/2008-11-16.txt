President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr President,
I am pleased to have this chance to meet with you once again on the sidelines of this summit and discuss our bilateral relations, which are indeed a strategic partnership in nature. Of course, we will also discuss the problems currently confronting the world economy.
We meet regularly, and this is very good as it enables us to resolve all manner of different issues. I think that our relations have gathered a good pace. New agreements were signed during the recent visit by Premier of the State Council Wen Jiabao, and this was also a good boost for developing our contacts.
President of the People’S Republic of China Hu Jintao (Retranslated from Russian): Mr President,
It is also a great pleasure for me to have this new opportunity to meet with you. I think this is our fourth meeting so far this year and it is clear proof of the high level of the strategic partnership and cooperation between China and Russia.
Chinese-Russian relations are growing at the moment. New progress has been made in our bilateral relations since our meeting at the SCO [Shanghai Cooperation Organisation] summit in Dushanbe. Our mutual support is also increasing on issues concerning our countries’ key interests. Our practical cooperation has achieved very good results. This is all to the benefit of strategic cooperation between our two countries.
