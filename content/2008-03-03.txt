The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Dmitry Anatolyevich [Medvedev],
I want to congratulate you once more on your confident victory in the Russian presidential election. In accordance with the law, the inauguration of the new president will take place at the start of May. Until that time, as we agreed, we will work together on organising the executive power structure. One other thing: I ask you to take responsibility during this period for preparing and chairing the State Council Presidium meetings.
Dmitry Medvedev: Thank you very much, Vladimir Vladimirovich, for your congratulations. I think that, ultimately, the election results reflect our citizens’ perception of the policies that have been implemented so effectively over these last years, and of course the trust our citizens our willing to place in us for a certain time to come.
I am ready to begin work on the issues you just mentioned, to start looking at the Government’s structure and begin working on the matters you raised just now.
Vladimir Putin: Good.
