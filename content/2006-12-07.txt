Vladimir Putin:
Good afternoon dear colleagues!
Today we shall examine one of the most important issues in military-technical cooperation, namely the development prospects for industrial cooperation between the defense enterprises of the CIS member countries.
The history of our common defense complex is well known. Cooperation in this field has developed over many decades. And today factories, scientific research institutes and design centres located in different CIS countries are strongly linked in a united technological and industrial chain.
Russia’s military-industrial complex uses thousands of brands of materials and accessories produced by CIS partners. For your information I can say that 800 enterprises in CIS countries act as the partners of Russia’s defense complex. Another example is that more than thousands of parts from 50 Russian manufacturers are delivered just for the aircraft engines of the Zaporozhsky Motor Sich company.
It is obvious that such close cooperation increases the effectiveness of the defense sectors of the CIS member states. A united technological base is being maintained, common norms, standards and testing grounds are being used. As a whole, military-technical cooperation is a significant part of the system of collective security and certainly first and foremost within the CSTO, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation.
It is necessary to consider that the steady industrial load for the enterprises of the military-industrial complex guarantees work for tens of thousands of workers and engineers, and the majority of them are very highly qualified experts. And this certainly supports the level of technology in these enterprises, the prospects for maintaining and developing this technology, and sometimes maintaining entire scientific schools.
Cooperation in production does more than simply help strengthen the defense capabilities of CIS countries. Today, the military-industrial complexes in Commonwealth states are competitive and profitable sectors of national economies. And you know that thanks to its quality and reliability, our military technology is in great demand throughout the world. Already this year we will reach the six billion dollar mark.
It is obvious that maintaining this cooperation is in the interest of most Commonwealth countries, as well as is increasing it in promising directions. This position was once again affirmed at the summit meeting that took place just recently in Minsk.
In connection with this I would like to emphasize several key moments.
First. It is necessary to carry out an inventory of the whole system of cooperation relations. And, first and foremost, to precisely define the areas that represent long-term priorities. I believe that in this respect the reference point is clear and visible to all. First and foremost we need to consider our own needs as stated in the Russian army’s weapons programme until 2015 and also, as I have already said, the forecasts of export deliveries.
Second. Developing the legal and administrative basis of our cooperation is a key factor in ensuring the reliability and steady growth of our cooperation.
Today the Agreement on Common Conditions and Mechanisms for Industrial Cooperation between the Enterprises and Branches of the CIS Member Countries, signed in 1993 in Ashkhabad, remains a defining document for the defense complexes of the CIS. The economic decisions that have been made within its framework have done more than simply help create the conditions so that the enterprises of the military-industrial complex can work during the period of massive reduction of state purchases. To no small degree, they helped retain the defense and industrial potential of the Commonwealth states.
As the Ashkhabad Agreement developed it came to include a package of bilateral agreements which make the conditions for military-technical cooperation more concrete.
Along with this, today I would like to hear your opinion on what is expediently required in the legal, administrative and legislative spheres to deepen military-technical cooperation in CIS countries. Of course, we are referring to countries that are interested in developing this cooperation and doing so in this direction.
Third. We have already said more than once that it is precisely military-technical cooperation that is able to help Russia and other CIS countries attain new goals with respect to creating modern military technology. New generation technology. For that reason we should pay primary attention to developing promising joint projects and programmes.
In addition to this, we must consider offers to improve the system of servicing technical equipment that has already been delivered. We should exchange opinions on some aspects of the ways activities in the military-technological sphere are regulated by law.
Thank you.
