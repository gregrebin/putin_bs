President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Shoigu, first of all, I congratulate you on your new appointment as governor of Moscow Region and of course wish you success in running this big and complicated region of such great importance for our country.
You are an experienced person and have been running the Emergency Situations Ministry for almost 20 years. First you took part in establishing the ministry, and then in organising its work. I hope that you will be just as successful in the Moscow Region as you were running the Emergency Situations Ministry. 
Your tasks as governor are clear: to improve people’s wellbeing and living standards, and pursue social and industrial development. You understand these tasks very well. Once more, I wish you success.

Working meeting with Moscow Region Governor Boris Gromov

16:00
Troitsk, Moscow Region
With Moscow Region Governor Boris Gromov.
* * *
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Gromov, I just wanted to say a big thank you to you for all of your work as governor of Moscow Region over these last 12 years. I think a lot has changed over this time. New social facilities have been built, one of which is serving as the venue for our meeting today. The biggest result of all is that general living standards in Moscow Region have risen and improved steadily over this time. 
I hope that Sergei Shoigu, who has just been named new governor of the region, and his team will continue this policy of building up the region, continuing its social development and improving living standards for all of the region’s residents. Once more, I think you for all your hard work.
