* * *
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Shoigu, first of all, I congratulate you on your new appointment as governor of Moscow Region and of course wish you success in running this big and complicated region of such great importance for our country.
You are an experienced person and have been running the Emergency Situations Ministry for almost 20 years. First you took part in establishing the ministry, and then in organising its work. I hope that you will be just as successful in the Moscow Region as you were running the Emergency Situations Ministry. 
Your tasks as governor are clear: to improve people’s wellbeing and living standards, and pursue social and industrial development. You understand these tasks very well. Once more, I wish you success.
