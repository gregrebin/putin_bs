Meeting with President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping.
President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): I warmly welcome my old friend Vladimir Putin to China!
In recent years, we have maintained close contacts, which plays an important role in promoting Russian-Chinese relations, helps to maintain the high level of cooperation, and contributes to enhancing both international and regional political climate.
Your visit is of particular importance, considering that this year we are marking the 15th anniversary of the Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighbourliness and Cooperation, and also the 20th anniversary of our decision to establish relations of strategic partnership and comprehensive cooperation.
In the previous two days, we held a meeting in Tashkent, and also took part in the 15th anniversary summit of the SCO and discussed the prospects of developing that organisation with other summit participants. I can express my satisfaction with the results of the summit.
I am determined, together with President Putin, to comprehensively promote and deepen our strategic partnership and cooperation, and to form new aspects for the development of our bilateral relations in the new environment.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, my friend,
We meet often and on a regular basis, but as was said just now on the way to this hall, each of our meetings is always substantive in nature. This time, we are meeting not just to mark a formal event – the 15th anniversary of the Agreement on Friendship, Good-Neighbourliness, and Cooperation, which is an important milestone – but also because life itself demands that our peoples work to strengthen and develop our relations.
Over this time, we have filled the agreements we reached 15 years ago with thriving, vibrant and much-needed content for the benefit of our countries and peoples.
We have a substantial agenda for today’s meeting too, of course. As you have just noted, we have colleagues from both sides here today, each of whom is carrying on intensive and I would say very meaningful work with their counterparts, and are having deep-reaching discussions that produce agreements, accords and contracts. This is taking our cooperation forward.

June 23, 2016
China will work together with Russia to take our relations to a qualitatively new level.
I would like to exchange views with you on current matters concerning our bilateral relations.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Premier of the State Council Li Keqiang,
You have just given a brief description of our relations. Of course, it is practically impossible to speak about all the different aspects of our relations in a single interview.
Our relationship really is one of comprehensive strategic partnership. Our ties are developing in many different areas and continue to make successful progress, opening up good prospects for the future. The work that we have already accomplished, especially in the economy, thanks to the efforts of our governments, yours and the Russian Prime Minister’s ensure and support this development.
The economy is at the foundation of our countries’ ties and we are doing much indeed to strengthen this foundation. However, we must use this as a base upon which to develop our partnership in other areas too, on the international arena, and in culture and education. In one way or another however, the economy is at the base of everything.
We therefore value greatly the attention you and your colleagues give to these matters. We know that work in different areas is not always easy and a lot of effort must go into developing specific projects, reaching all the necessary approvals and striking a balance of interests. However, we always build our relations on a consideration of each other’s interests, and we are successful in this. Therefore, I would like to thank you very much for this work.
Thank you.

Russian-Chinese talks in expanded format.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, friends,
During our narrow-format meeting, we have just discussed a wide range of bilateral cooperation matters and international issues of great interest to both countries, and we looked in detail at specific cooperation sectors. Now, we will discuss these different sectors in greater detail with the ministers and deputy ministers and outline the areas of our joint work over the coming months and the longer term.
I am sure that our countries can achieve even greater results in all areas: in trade, investment, agriculture, energy, and in the high-tech sector, which is one of our priorities.
Thank you very much

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping
, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
The fifteenth anniversary of the Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation is indeed a remarkable occasion for our nations, and it is not by chance that that we timed today’s summit talks, which have been so fruitful, to coincide with that date. It is this Treaty that outlined and provided the legal framework for the strategic and collaborative nature of Russian-Chinese relations. A new type of relations, based on mutual respect, friendship, and consideration for each other’s interests, these relations not only meet the fundamental interests of our peoples, the long-term objectives of our two countries’ development, but also, as my friend President Xi Jinping has just said, they are an important factor of global and regional stability and security.

In building the Russian-Chinese partnership, we have relied on many centuries of cooperation between our countries. The unprecedented level, achieved through mutual trust and understanding, allowed us to resolve complicated and fairly delicate issued that we inherited, and most importantly, we have opened opportunities for moving forward, for establishing multilateral relations in the most diverse areas.
In the run-up to the Treaty, hundreds of bilateral documents have been signed, favourable conditions were created for boosting the cooperation of government agencies, regions, public and business communities, representatives of science, culture and education. Inter-parliamentary exchanges have acquired a systemic character.
Russia and China closely cooperate in foreign policy and security, we have the same approaches towards a wide range of international and regional problems.
Law enforcement agencies are enhancing their coordination, including in countering today’s biggest threat: terrorism.
In fact, the Treaty has become a guide in our everyday activities. Every four years, joint plans are adopted on implementing the provisions of the Treaty. We have managed to establish stable trade and economic cooperation and set up a power alliance, we are expanding financial and investment interaction and boosting cooperation in innovations and high technologies.
Impressive progress in developing humanitarian contacts has been made in the past 15 years. Cultural, educational and tourist exchanges have increased many times over.
Friends, colleagues,
We are grateful to our Chinese partners and friends for such thorough and festive preparations for the event related to the fifteenth anniversary of signing this Treaty, which has truly made a significant contribution to the development of our bilateral relations, creating prospects for further development and strengthening friendship between the peoples of China and Russia.
Thank you very much.
