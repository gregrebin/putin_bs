Barvikha, Moscow Region
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Vice President,
I am pleased to see you once again. We already met in May 2008. Quite some time has passed since then, but the good relations, strategic partnership and cooperation that distinguish our countries have not changed.
Our countries are good partners and our countries’ leaders have established friendly regular contacts between them. Last year, I met five times with President of China Hu Jintao, and we have more meetings planned for this year.
Now you are visiting our country. Yesterday saw the opening of the Year of the Chinese Language in Russia, and this event was yet another sign of how we are developing our ties in all different areas.
You have a tight schedule as you are visiting not just Moscow but also our regions. This is very good to see, because cooperation between our countries goes far beyond the relations between Moscow and Beijing. Our regions are also developing ties of their own, and it is a good thing that you have this chance to visit different parts of Russia.
Once again, Mr Xi Jinping, I welcome you to Russia.
