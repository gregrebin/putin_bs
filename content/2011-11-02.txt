Speech at the closing plenary session of the Russia-Republic of Korea Dialogue forum.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: President Lee Myung-bak, ladies and gentlemen,
I wish you all a warm welcome and I am very pleased that this forum is continuing its work. The Russia-Republic of Korea Dialogue forum got off to a very successful start in Seoul exactly a year ago now. Over these last days, its events have brought together politicians, businesspeople, scientists, cultural figures, and public representatives, and, also very important, as my colleagues just noted, they have gathered here in St Petersburg representatives of the young generation who are our countries’ future leaders.
As was said just now, the forum’s focus has been on modernising the state and society and on innovation activity – very relevant topics for our countries’ development today. We have exchanged views and discussed the Republic of Korea’s experience in fields in which we could follow its example, and this is all very useful for us. The business-like atmosphere at the events here reflects our countries’ genuine interest in developing precisely these kinds of projects. 
”We can work together to carry out a more effective modernisation policy, raise our education and healthcare standards, protect the environment, and successfully spread the use of energy-efficient technology.“
We can work together to carry out a more effective modernisation policy, raise our education and healthcare standards, protect the environment, and successfully spread the use of energy-efficient technology. As I just said, the fact that young people are involved in the forum’s work is particularly important. 
The second Russian-Korean Youth Dialogue that took place in August this year gave dozens of students from our countries’ leading universities the chance to get to know each other and learn a lot of new information about Russia and South Korea and their peoples, attend lectures by prominent scholars, and express their own points of view on the modern world’s problems at round table discussions.
The two forums that have taken place to date provide a clear demonstration of how their spirit helps to develop and strengthen the friendly ties between our countries. The delegates do not limit themselves to official channels only in developing these ties, which is also very good to see, and this is all laying good ground for the future.
As can be seen from development experience around the world in general, civil society institutions are weaving themselves ever more closely into the fabric of public life and even government life too, directly influencing government decisions. The actors in these kinds of exchanges, whether economic, educational, or cultural, often have a much deeper knowledge of the situation in specific international cooperation fields.
