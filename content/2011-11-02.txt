Speech at the closing plenary session of the Russia-Republic of Korea Dialogue forum.

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: President Lee Myung-bak, ladies and gentlemen,
I wish you all a warm welcome and I am very pleased that this forum is continuing its work. The Russia-Republic of Korea Dialogue forum got off to a very successful start in Seoul exactly a year ago now. Over these last days, its events have brought together politicians, businesspeople, scientists, cultural figures, and public representatives, and, also very important, as my colleagues just noted, they have gathered here in St Petersburg representatives of the young generation who are our countries’ future leaders.
As was said just now, the forum’s focus has been on modernising the state and society and on innovation activity – very relevant topics for our countries’ development today. We have exchanged views and discussed the Republic of Korea’s experience in fields in which we could follow its example, and this is all very useful for us. The business-like atmosphere at the events here reflects our countries’ genuine interest in developing precisely these kinds of projects. 
”We can work together to carry out a more effective modernisation policy, raise our education and healthcare standards, protect the environment, and successfully spread the use of energy-efficient technology.“
We can work together to carry out a more effective modernisation policy, raise our education and healthcare standards, protect the environment, and successfully spread the use of energy-efficient technology. As I just said, the fact that young people are involved in the forum’s work is particularly important. 
The second Russian-Korean Youth Dialogue that took place in August this year gave dozens of students from our countries’ leading universities the chance to get to know each other and learn a lot of new information about Russia and South Korea and their peoples, attend lectures by prominent scholars, and express their own points of view on the modern world’s problems at round table discussions.
The two forums that have taken place to date provide a clear demonstration of how their spirit helps to develop and strengthen the friendly ties between our countries. The delegates do not limit themselves to official channels only in developing these ties, which is also very good to see, and this is all laying good ground for the future.
As can be seen from development experience around the world in general, civil society institutions are weaving themselves ever more closely into the fabric of public life and even government life too, directly influencing government decisions. The actors in these kinds of exchanges, whether economic, educational, or cultural, often have a much deeper knowledge of the situation in specific international cooperation fields.Events

President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: President Lee Myung-bak, Korean friends and colleagues,
I wish you a warm welcome to St Petersburg, where the Russian-Korean public forum has just ended and we will now hold bilateral talks.
Mr President, you just gave an outstanding speech on our countries’ relations. I think that Russian-Korean relations do indeed have a very bright future. We are moving ahead in all areas, whether in the economy, in our big international projects, or in new fields such as innovation and modernisation, and also humanitarian cooperation of course.
It is good to have this chance now to exchange views on regional security (this is an issue of paramount importance and we are ready for broad cooperation with the Republic of Korea in this area) and on the current situation in the global economy and financial system, all the more so as we will be leaving from here for Cannes to discuss global economic development issues.
”I think that Russian-Korean relations do indeed have a very bright future. We are moving ahead in all areas, whether in the economy, in our big international projects, or in new fields such as innovation and modernisation, and also humanitarian cooperation.“
Once again, I wish you a warm welcome to St Petersburg, Mr President.
President of The Republic of Korea Lee Myung-Bak
(retranslated): As I understand it, St Petersburg is President Medvedev’s native city, and I also have a good personal connection to this city.
Since taking office as President, I have visited Russia every year, and have thus become the first president [of Korea] to visit Russia so often.
I am also very pleased to see the dynamic way our relations are developing in a broad range of sectors. I am very happy too that the agreements we concluded during our last meeting are now in the process of implementation.
Our cooperation is intensifying not just in trade and investment but in other areas too. I think that our countries, more so than other countries, can be the best of partners because we have mutually complementary organisations that we can develop on a mutually advantageous basis.
This explains our relations’ good development, all the more so as there are no issues between us. I hope that our governments will continue their utmost efforts to keep building up these relations in the future.
The world is currently facing a budget crisis, and I hope very much that our countries will also do their part to overcome this crisis.
I am very pleased to be having this meeting.
