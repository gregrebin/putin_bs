President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam President, friends, welcome. It gives me great pleasure to see you again.
We have always had a good partnership with Chile. This year we will soon be marking 70 years of diplomatic relations between our states. We maintain an intensive political dialogue; we have set up an intergovernmental commission and business council, which are operating successfully. Naturally, our relations should be augmented by numerous economic ties that would reflect our countries’ potential.
I am very happy to see you again.
President of Chile Michelle Bachelet (retranslated): Good afternoon, Mr President. Thank you very much for this meeting. I am happy to see you again; last time we met was on the sidelines of the BRICS
summit in Brazil.
You mentioned that December 11 marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. In fact, our relations have existed even longer, because in 1909 a Russian ambassador presented his credentials to our country, which means our relations are even older.
As you have said, we are maintaining dialogue on a number of various issues. We hope we will have more specific achievements and will make progress in such areas as, for instance, drafting an agreement on cooperation in education and culture, joining efforts on combatting organised crime, ties in energy and exchange of statistical data. As I have said, we already have established ties in culture as well as in defence, where we expect to expand our cooperation with the Russian Federation in the future.
Our bilateral commission is working on a number of matters, including cooperation in the sphere of customs and energy. Tatiana Valovaya [member of Eurasian Economic Commission Board] is to visit us on November 26. We expect to have a more detailed discussion with her to consolidate the progress made. We hope to achieve practical, specific cooperation in the most important areas for our countries.
As you may know, Mr President, we are strongly interested in the prospect of working together on drafting an agreement on free trade, not only with Russia, but also with the Customs Union
. We hope you will support us at the Eurasian Economic Commission as well.
We acknowledge the leading position of the Russian Federation in science and technology, and we would like to see our relations in these areas grow deeper and become more specific.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, welcome.
Only yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending a festival of Japanese martial arts in Moscow. I would like to thank you, Mr Prime Minister, and those of your colleagues who were involved in the organisation of this event, for the pleasure they gave to Russian fans of martial arts. This is not only sports, but also a significant part of Japanese culture, and this, in turn, is the best basis for developing bilateral relations, which have been making good progress in the past years both in the economy and politics.
When I speak of politics, I am also referring to the renewal of our talks on a peace treaty. In this connection, I am happy to have this opportunity to meet with you again here, on the sidelines of the APEC summit and together analyse all the aspects of our cooperation.
Thank you.
Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
(retranslated): Mr President, I am very happy to see you again after our brief meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe summit in Milan. In fact, this is the tenth time we meet if we take into account our meetings during my first term as Prime Minister.
I would like to thank you for attending the festival of Japanese martial arts. I believe that your knowledge of Japanese martial arts as a judo wrestler means a better understanding of Japan in general. This is beneficial for the further development and strengthening of Japanese-Russian relations.
Today I would like to focus on an exchange of views on the peace treaty and on certain international issues.

President of People’S Republic of China Xi Jinping
(retranslated): Good afternoon. My friend, welcome to Beijing, where you have arrived to take part in the APEC summit.
We have lately enhanced our strategic management and planning in bilateral relations; we hold frequent meetings and take good care of the evergreen tree of Chinese-Russian friendship.
Autumn is harvest time and a time for new achievements. Our course towards strengthening overall partnership and strategic cooperation has the full support of the people of China and Russia, meets their expectations and complies with the spirit of the times.
Whatever changes occur on the world arena, we will consider enhancing our cooperation as a priority area in our foreign policy, and we will strengthen mutual political trust and expand mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.
Next year we will be celebrating the 70th anniversary of Victory in World War II. Our foreign policy agencies have come up with an impressive list of events that we intend to hold to celebrate this anniversary. This will provide a new opportunity to jointly protect the post-war world order and strengthen the bonds of friendship and cooperation between our countries and peoples.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: My friend, Mr President, colleagues, I would like to thank you for the invitation and for today’s meeting.
I fully agree with you that our staff and we have done a great deal to develop Russian-Chinese strategic relations. I would like to stress that they are expanding in practically every area. This equally applies to our political relations, our defence and military technology cooperation, and the economy.
As for our economic ties, I would like to note that while last year our trade went up by 1.3 percent, in the first nine months of this year it increased by 7 percent. This is a great achievement and proof that our efforts have not been wasted. It shows that our people are getting to know each other better; they are closely cooperating and achieving good results for the benefit of our economies and social spheres, to ensure that our people have a better standard of living, that they have high incomes and are able to resolve all the issues in their daily lives.
Regarding cooperation on the world arena, I would also like to note the importance of cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation for keeping the world within the framework of international law, to make it more stable and predictable. You and I have done a great deal to this end and I am certain we will continue our efforts in this direction.
Today’s meeting and this visit should give an additional impetus to our relations. We know how difficult it is to organise events of such a scale as APEC. At the same time, we know that our Chinese friends are good at hosting such major events.
We wish you every success. Thank you very much.
