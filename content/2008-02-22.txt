The Kremlin, Moscow
President of The Russian Federation Vladimir Putin: Gurbanguly Myalikkulievich,
I want to wish you a warm welcome once more and thank you for accepting our invitation. I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations. We have a large amount of cooperation and big plans. At the multilateral meeting today you mentioned some of the big projects we plan to carry out such as the Caspian Gas Pipeline and the development of the Central Asian energy transport system. Aside from our energy sector projects, there are also many other areas in which we have excellent cooperation prospects. I am therefore very happy to have this chance to meet and I wish you welcome once again.
President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov: Thank you very much, Vladimir Vladimirovich. Allow me to thank you once again for the invitation and for the warmth and hospitality we have received. We are happy to be here in Russia.
We spoke a lot today about how cooperation between our two countries is developing very well, as 2007 has shown. I also said today that the establishment of our intergovernmental Commission has been very productive, and we are very thankful to you for this. We are pleased to see that Russian construction companies have already begun working in our country now and that work in the oil and gas industry is also underway. Just this morning I signed an order, for around 350 million euros, with Stroitransgaz, on building a pipeline of around 190 kilometres in length, I think.
We have achieved very positive results and I think that we will continue working together in this spirit.
