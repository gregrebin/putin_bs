President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon,
Opening this ceremony, I would first and foremost like to congratulate you on the official start of your diplomatic mission in the Russian Federation. I hope that your involved and active efforts will contribute to the development of relations between your countries and the Russian Federation.
The first decade of this century has confirmed that the main direction in which the global community is moving is towards a polycentric world order, one that is fairer and more democratic, and reflects the modern aspirations of different states and nations. Against this background, cooperation between states, joint efforts for multilateral development and a collective response to common threats and challenges are increasingly becoming key factors in international relations.
One of the most immediate threats is international terrorism, which violates the fundamental rights and freedoms and the democratic foundations of society, and denies the value of human life. As you know, a terrorist attack was perpetrated at the Domodedovo Airport on January 24, in which citizens of several countries were killed.
”Russia will continue to wage an uncompromising struggle against international terrorism and will be a reliable ally to the states that use every legitimate means at their disposal to combat terrorism.“
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported us and offered assistance at this difficult time. I would also like to say that Russia will continue to wage an uncompromising struggle against international terrorism and will be a reliable ally to the states that use every legitimate means at their disposal to combat terrorism.
Strengthening global security is a vital precondition for our joint efforts toward modern sustainable development. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between Russia and the United States, which entered into force just recently, has been a significant step toward this goal. This result was achieved through involved efforts based on the principles of equal and constructive cooperation, and we expect that it will contribute further to the formation of global security architecture.
We are guided by these considerations when we help resolve crisis situations, including in the Middle East, which is now witnessing very violent and controversial events. Russia will continue to do everything possible to restore lasting peace in the region and to create conditions for amicable coexistence of different states and nations.
Now a few words about relations between Russia and the countries that you have the honour of representing. We can say that 2010 was marked by dramatic, positive changes in relations between Russia and Ukraine. Through joint efforts our relations have been transformed into a constructive partnership, which is already bearing fruit: the ties that were destroyed some time ago have been restored, including cultural and educational ties between our two fraternal nations. Today we can look ahead with confidence, setting major objectives for ourselves. President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and I spoke about that yesterday.
We are looking forward to constructive cooperation with the Czech Republic and to building mutually beneficial cooperation in the development of political dialogue, strengthening cooperation in various fields, including in the economy, trade and investment.
Many decades of friendly relations bind the Russian people and one of the leading African nations: the Republic of South Africa. Today, shared views on current international issues encourage the progressive deepening of those ties. We are developing our contacts at the political level and at the level of business dialogue. I am confident that the accession of South Africa to BRIC, which has been renamed BRICS, will reveal the potential of our future cooperation more fully.
We stand for the strengthening of multilateral relations with Gabon, and we have an excellent legal basis for that. At the moment we are developing and implementing specific projects in trade and business.
We note with satisfaction the positive dynamics in the development of our bilateral ties with Malaysia. Our agenda covers strengthening cooperation in high technology, energy, including nuclear power, telecommunications, aerospace and civil aviation.
We are interested in expanding political dialogue and search for new forms of economic cooperation with the Republic of Sierra Leone. A good example here is the project being implemented by Russian experts for employing environmentally sound technology in fishing and processing of fish products.
”The main direction in which the global community is moving is towards a polycentric world order, one that is fairer and more democratic, and reflects the modern aspirations of different states and nations.“
Relations between Russia and Kyrgyzstan have traditionally been close and friendly. We have helped Kyrgyzstan through difficult times and are ready to provide further assistance to promote the development of Kyrgyzstan as an independent state, consistently strengthen bilateral ties and multilateral cooperation in the region for the benefit of our nations and ensuring stability in Central Asia.
There are excellent mutually beneficial opportunities for the development of bilateral relations between our country and Hungary. Currently, the Republic of Hungary holds the EU Presidency. We sincerely wish our Hungarian partners every success and hope that your country's Presidency in the EU will further deepen the partnership between the EU and Russia.
The Republic of Poland is certainly an important and very promising partner for us. I recently paid an official visit to Warsaw and hope that we have opened a new chapter in the history of our two countries. Today we must not only remember the past but also look straight ahead. If these two components are balanced, I am sure that Russian-Polish cooperation will develop in all spheres.
Our cooperation with Italy has reached unprecedented heights. Our relations are absolutely strategic, our trade and economic relations are developing successfully in very important areas, including high technology and innovation, and major projects are being implemented in various fields. Our cooperation has great importance in addressing major international issues. Therefore, I also attach particular importance to the development of humanitarian ties with Italy.
Next week I will visit Rome, where together with the Italian leadership I will participate in the opening of the Year of Russian Culture and Language in Italy and the Italian Culture and Language in Russia. I am confident that this will be a great event.
Allow me to sincerely wish you every success in your responsible mission in the Russian Federation. I hope that your stay in Moscow will be productive and interesting for you personally and for your countries.
Once again, every success to you and thank you for your attention.

Speech at opening of the First National Russian Science Festival
February 8, 2011
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Friends, I congratulate the laureates once again, and everyone here, on Russian Science Day. It is a pleasure to talk with you in an informal setting this time, not in the Kremlin, but at the Polytechnic Museum, which as we have seen, is about to be reborn. We all wish this work success, because this museum is a great support for everyone interested in science and technology. We need to ensure that it retains all of its former qualities, while at the same time moving forward and becoming a technologically advanced centre of interest to today’s youth. 
The museum was founded in the nineteenth century, during what we could call the flowering of engineering advances and the natural sciences. These kinds of assessments are all relative, really, but it was indeed established at the initiative of the imperial society of amateur natural scientists under the patronage of Alexander II. Today, the first Russian National Science Festival is opening here, and as I understand it, it will run right through until October. I hope this will turn out to be an interesting and educational project that will be helpful for schoolchildren and everyone involved in science and its popularisation, including as far as the matters we already discussed today are concerned.
I remind you that in April 2010 I gave the instruction to develop a new concept for the museum. This concept has been approved now. I hope the work will go ahead in accordance with the schedule the director presented just before.
Now to the issues before us, namely, the question of attracting talented young people into science and innovation. In December 2009, we discussed this subject in depth with the heads of the Russian Academy of Sciences. I hope that we will come back to it during our discussions today. Here, I am addressing Mr Osipov [Yury Osipov, President of the Russian Academy of Sciences]. Why, because I think that our decisions must be implemented. As far as I know, there is progress, including on the biggest problems, and the biggest problems, even in science, are the issues of everyday life. We said that we must start by resolving young scientists’ housing problems. I took the Government to task over this later. I think that did have some effect, and it seems that some apartments are ready now. How many, Mr Osipov?
President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Yury Osipov: We have received 150 apartments so far. This was done over January alone. Now it is still February, and the Government is holding constant meetings on the issue.
Dmitry Medvedev: So I don’t need to scold anyone anymore? I can take a softer line now?
Yury Osipov: Sometimes it can be useful to get a scolding from you, Mr President.
Dmitry Medvedev: Well, I will do so then, what choice do I have?
Yury Osipov: But things are moving now.
Dmitry Medvedev: It’s good that things are moving, because I remember the bored looks on the faces of some of my colleagues when this was all being discussed, and I had to really make use of my power then. Let’s keep up the pace then and get this work finished.
Yury Osipov: Thank you.
Dmitry Medvedev: Another matter is that the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Youth Commission made available an additional 1,000 salaried positions at the end of last year. I was briefed on this today by the minister. I think this is very good. We are talking about almost half of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ existing 400 research centres, am I right?
Yury Osipov: Yes, the money has been distributed, and we have kept 70 positions in reserve with the idea that particularly interesting people could emerge, while the rest have been distributed between the different institutes on a tender basis. It is interesting to note that there is competition for these positions, more than two institutes for each position. This is good to see. The money has now been distributed, and the institutes are now organising tenders to select the people to whom it will go to.
Thank you very much for this, Mr President.
Dmitry Medvedev: Good, so things are moving in this area too?
Yury Osipov: Yes, things are moving full steam ahead.
Dmitry Medvedev: Good, I remind you that the size of the presidential grants for young Ph.D. and D.Sc. holders was increased substantially and now comes to 600,000 rubles for Ph.D. degree holders, and 1 million rubles for D.Sc. degree holders. 
Education and Science Minister Andrei Fursenko
: For a year.
Dmitry Medvedev: For a year, of course.
But this is not all, of course, and we can keep discussing this. I think that the state authorities need to do more to put in place all of the best possible conditions. Of course, this will never be anything completely exceptional, but the authorities in the broad sense – the federal, regional, and even municipal authorities — do need to ensure the minimum essential conditions.
The global world and the world of science know no borders, and we understand this. We therefore invite not only our own scientists to take part in these projects, but foreigners too. I think this is the right approach, because this is what scientific competition is all about, all the more so as our scientists go abroad and also participate – on a competitive basis – in projects abroad. This is just the kind of full-blooded environment that will help us to resolve the more difficult tasks ahead.
We have young people here today, and I want them to take part too in discussing the various issues involved in developing science, and developing education in general in our country and improving the way science is managed. The Youth Coordination Council has already made a shortlist of projects competing for the presidential grants and prizes for young scientists. In the views of senior colleagues, these projects are of high quality, and we shall see what comes of them. It is important to develop the network of regional councils of young scientists and specialists that have been established now in 81 different regions, practically throughout the entire country.
I want you to tell me, of course, about how you see the future of Russian science, what, in your view, are our strong points and weak points. Of course, we all have a fair idea of where our weak points lie at the moment, and in which areas we need to give new impetus.
But in any case, I can say that the situation has started to change of late. It has not changed radically, but things are improving. This is true of education and of science too. As someone who worked for quite a long time in the university system, I will not hide that I am very pleased to see these changes, because everyone who remembers the 1990s, remembers that they were very difficult years and the mood was very pessimistic back then. It was difficult to be optimistic. But this is all changing now.
There are problems. I have been discussing these problems not just here, not just with our young people working in science, but abroad too, with people working there. The last time was in Silicon Valley. That was an interesting discussion. There are very successful people working there, some of them left quite a long time ago, and some only recently. Some of them see their future in America, and others do not. But the conversation was very illustrative.
We should probably look at some additional incentives too. I think these could include the introduction of presidential scholarships for young people, who show promise in terms of developing priority modernisation areas. We will discuss the size of these scholarships, but they should provide decent sums of money for the chosen young people.
So, if you have similar ideas, I am willing to support them, though within reasonable limits. Let’s discuss all of this now.
There is one other matter I wanted to raise now. It is not directly related to science, but it does concern a huge number of people around the country. Indeed, it concerns everyone here. Can you guess what it is? It is the rather specific matter of changeover from summer time to winter time. 
In my 2009 Annual Presidential Address, I spoke about this. A number of serious and lengthy studies have been carried out. We are all used to putting the clocks forward or back each spring and autumn, and we are all used to moaning about it too, given that it genuinely does upset the natural biological rhythm, and everybody hates it, hates waking up too early and not knowing what to do with the extra hour. That’s not to mention the poor cows and other animals, who don’t know about such things as changing the clocks and don’t understand why no one comes to milk them at the right time.
I think that the need to adapt to the time change provokes stress and illness. Perhaps it would be a useful thing for us to do away with this changeover and just keep summer time throughout the country, which will mean more daylight overall. Based on these considerations, I have therefore decided to abolish the changeover to winter time starting this autumn, and will instruct the Government accordingly.
We will not change over to winter time, though we will have to go through one more unpleasant moment when we switch to summer time and lose an hour of sleep, but this will be the last time. It will give us a longer day too. I think this will be good for the country on the whole. Anyway, people have asked me to do this repeatedly.

Speech at opening ceremony of the First National Russian Science Festival
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Hello, friends,
I would like to sincerely congratulate you on Russian Science Day. This is a truly major national event. The First Russian Science Festival, which is taking place here, in these walls, is also a major event. I hope that those of you present truly want to work in science and are already doing so.
This festival used to be based at Moscow State University, and then, at the rector’s suggestion, we made it a National Russian Science Festival. I am very pleased that today, you are meeting here to hear lectures and talk to one another. I also know that some Olympiad winners are present here, which is very important.
In addition, here today are winners of state awards for young scientists, to whom I presented these awards earlier today. I want to once again congratulate them, for the fifth time, I think. I feel this is a very important result, because we have begun granting prizes not only based on the results of scientific work, which I also spoke about earlier, but also for the contribution by young specialists and scientists whose scientific careers are just beginning, yet they have already made their contribution to the development of Russian science. And I think it is a good sign that this is taking place in the Kremlin. Afterwards, I spoke with some of the young scientists, who told me about the problems existing in our nation, as well as prospects for the future.
I would like to use this opportunity again to say that naturally, the development of science in our nation has followed a very difficult path over the last twenty years. At the same time, in recent years, we have made some progress. It concerns everything ranging from scientific infrastructure, acquiring new equipment, and research funding to social standards, living standards for specialists and scientists for whom these areas represent their main professional activities.
We are still at the beginning of the road, but our nation is committed to promoting the development of science and supporting researchers, making it one of its top priorities. I have continuously stated this on many occasions. And even the concept of our nation’s development that is being carried out today, the concept for modernising our nation, including technological modernisation – we understand that it cannot resolve these challenges if no investment is made in science, fundamental sciences and applied research. And I would very much like for everyone here today to remember this, to believe in Russia’s potential and to believe in their own potential.
I wish you all success in your work and I hope that you will have a great time socialising here at the Polytechnic Museum. I hope that the science festival will become a traditional annual event for many years to come.
I wish you prosperity and all the very best. Congratulations once again.
