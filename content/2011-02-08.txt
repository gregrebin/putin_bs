President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Good afternoon,
Opening this ceremony, I would first and foremost like to congratulate you on the official start of your diplomatic mission in the Russian Federation. I hope that your involved and active efforts will contribute to the development of relations between your countries and the Russian Federation.
The first decade of this century has confirmed that the main direction in which the global community is moving is towards a polycentric world order, one that is fairer and more democratic, and reflects the modern aspirations of different states and nations. Against this background, cooperation between states, joint efforts for multilateral development and a collective response to common threats and challenges are increasingly becoming key factors in international relations.
One of the most immediate threats is international terrorism, which violates the fundamental rights and freedoms and the democratic foundations of society, and denies the value of human life. As you know, a terrorist attack was perpetrated at the Domodedovo Airport on January 24, in which citizens of several countries were killed.
”Russia will continue to wage an uncompromising struggle against international terrorism and will be a reliable ally to the states that use every legitimate means at their disposal to combat terrorism.“
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported us and offered assistance at this difficult time. I would also like to say that Russia will continue to wage an uncompromising struggle against international terrorism and will be a reliable ally to the states that use every legitimate means at their disposal to combat terrorism.
Strengthening global security is a vital precondition for our joint efforts toward modern sustainable development. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between Russia and the United States, which entered into force just recently, has been a significant step toward this goal. This result was achieved through involved efforts based on the principles of equal and constructive cooperation, and we expect that it will contribute further to the formation of global security architecture.
We are guided by these considerations when we help resolve crisis situations, including in the Middle East, which is now witnessing very violent and controversial events. Russia will continue to do everything possible to restore lasting peace in the region and to create conditions for amicable coexistence of different states and nations.
Now a few words about relations between Russia and the countries that you have the honour of representing. We can say that 2010 was marked by dramatic, positive changes in relations between Russia and Ukraine. Through joint efforts our relations have been transformed into a constructive partnership, which is already bearing fruit: the ties that were destroyed some time ago have been restored, including cultural and educational ties between our two fraternal nations. Today we can look ahead with confidence, setting major objectives for ourselves. President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and I spoke about that yesterday.
We are looking forward to constructive cooperation with the Czech Republic and to building mutually beneficial cooperation in the development of political dialogue, strengthening cooperation in various fields, including in the economy, trade and investment.
Many decades of friendly relations bind the Russian people and one of the leading African nations: the Republic of South Africa. Today, shared views on current international issues encourage the progressive deepening of those ties. We are developing our contacts at the political level and at the level of business dialogue. I am confident that the accession of South Africa to BRIC, which has been renamed BRICS, will reveal the potential of our future cooperation more fully.
We stand for the strengthening of multilateral relations with Gabon, and we have an excellent legal basis for that. At the moment we are developing and implementing specific projects in trade and business.
We note with satisfaction the positive dynamics in the development of our bilateral ties with Malaysia. Our agenda covers strengthening cooperation in high technology, energy, including nuclear power, telecommunications, aerospace and civil aviation.
We are interested in expanding political dialogue and search for new forms of economic cooperation with the Republic of Sierra Leone. A good example here is the project being implemented by Russian experts for employing environmentally sound technology in fishing and processing of fish products.
”The main direction in which the global community is moving is towards a polycentric world order, one that is fairer and more democratic, and reflects the modern aspirations of different states and nations.“
Relations between Russia and Kyrgyzstan have traditionally been close and friendly. We have helped Kyrgyzstan through difficult times and are ready to provide further assistance to promote the development of Kyrgyzstan as an independent state, consistently strengthen bilateral ties and multilateral cooperation in the region for the benefit of our nations and ensuring stability in Central Asia.
There are excellent mutually beneficial opportunities for the development of bilateral relations between our country and Hungary. Currently, the Republic of Hungary holds the EU Presidency. We sincerely wish our Hungarian partners every success and hope that your country's Presidency in the EU will further deepen the partnership between the EU and Russia.
The Republic of Poland is certainly an important and very promising partner for us. I recently paid an official visit to Warsaw and hope that we have opened a new chapter in the history of our two countries. Today we must not only remember the past but also look straight ahead. If these two components are balanced, I am sure that Russian-Polish cooperation will develop in all spheres.
Our cooperation with Italy has reached unprecedented heights. Our relations are absolutely strategic, our trade and economic relations are developing successfully in very important areas, including high technology and innovation, and major projects are being implemented in various fields. Our cooperation has great importance in addressing major international issues. Therefore, I also attach particular importance to the development of humanitarian ties with Italy.
Next week I will visit Rome, where together with the Italian leadership I will participate in the opening of the Year of Russian Culture and Language in Italy and the Italian Culture and Language in Russia. I am confident that this will be a great event.
Allow me to sincerely wish you every success in your responsible mission in the Russian Federation. I hope that your stay in Moscow will be productive and interesting for you personally and for your countries.
Once again, every success to you and thank you for your attention.
