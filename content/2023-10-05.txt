Address on Teacher’s Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends,
I am sincerely happy to congratulate all teachers, mentors and educators on Teacher’s Day.
This holiday evokes special and very warm feelings. Today, people are expressing gratitude to their beloved teachers all across the country.
We often say that being a teacher is not just a job, and this is absolutely true. It is a calling, a noble and highly important mission. Your work, patience, care and support help every person to unlock his or her abilities, the best human qualities and to obtain knowledge and spiritual values that will serve as a reliable pillar during their whole life. Even many years later, we invariably recall our schoolteachers, their advice and emotional support with love and gratitude.
The talent, professionalism and dedication of those who are now working with children and teenagers are highly important for preserving the continuity of generations, for accumulating and building on the achievements for which our country is famous.
We are consistently creating a modern educational environment for students and teachers in order to ensure rapid progress, which is necessary in today’s world. We update textbooks and curricula with the help of teachers. We will continue to actively build schools, renovate school buildings and create more comfortable working conditions for teachers.
I would like to note that professional competitions are increasingly playing a prominent role. They help dedicated teachers win the recognition of the public and their colleagues and increase the overall prestige of teaching as a career.
The current Year of Teacher and Mentor is another sign of profound and sincere respect for your work, and we will certainly expand the range of measures for supporting our teachers.
I would like to wish you good health, happiness, prosperity and, of course, professional success. For you, this means the success and victories of your pupils, and it would be no exaggeration to say that they will determine the future of this country.
Congratulations! Happy Teacher’s Day!
