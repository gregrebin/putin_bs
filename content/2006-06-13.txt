Speech at the Ceremony for Awarding the Global Energy Prize

Saint Petersburg
Vladimir Putin: Dear friends!
I sincerely welcome you to an event that has already become a tradition, awarding the Global Energy Prize.
Four years ago Russia founded the international award for outstanding research in the energy sector. Recently this award has received both the authority and respect it deserves.
Today the international award committee includes 30 major scientists from nine countries and more than 600 member of the scientific community have the right to put forward nominees. And the number of people participating in the competition increases every year.
I will emphasize that as one of the world’s energy leaders Russia is not only engaged in exporting energy resources and electricity. We intend to continue supporting scientific research that will increase the efficiency and security of energy production. And of course research that conforms to environmental standards. Various important directions include hydrogen energy, thermonuclear energy, bioenergy and nanoenergy.
We are convinced that the Global Energy Prize helps unite the best efforts in global science and breakthrough initiatives in research. It supports research to supply all mankind with energy.
As you know, energy security will be one of the main themes at the forthcoming G8 summit that will take place here, in St Petersburg.
Dear friends!
Today we are celebrating the new winners of the Global Energy Prize, an international team involved in developing the International Thermonuclear Reactor (ITER).
Russia, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Canada, China and South Korea have united their efforts towards creating an essentially new energy source. And it is especially pleasant for me to present this prestigious international award to academician Evgenii Pavlovich Velikhov, French scientist Dr. Robert Aymar and Japanese scientist Dr. Yoshikawa Masaji.
As far as I know, this is the first time that a collective prize has been awarded. Dear gentlemen, this confirms the unique value of your joint scientific research.
It is with my whole heart that I congratulate the winners of the prize. I wish you health, well-being and success. And of course new scientific discoveries for the good of humanity.
I want to thank the scientists actively working on the international award committee and also the founders of the prize, including leading energy companies such as Gazprom, Unified Energy Systems of Russia and Surgutneftegaz.
I wish us successes with all my heart.
Thank you very much for your attention.

Beginning of the Meeting with the Head of Forbes Publishing Company, Stephen Forbes
June 13, 2006
00:00
Saint Petersburg
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon dear colleagues.
I am very glad that Forbes is paying so much attention to developing its relations with Russia and to making people aware of Russian-American cooperation in all fields. I know about your initiative to hold a Forbes CEO Forum in 2007 in Moscow.
The magazine is well-known and popular not only among experts but also among the general public. So I am pleased to meet with you. And I hope that further attention that you and your colleagues pay to Russia will remain of the same, high-quality kind.
Steven Forbes: (back translation) Thank you Mr President for finding the time to meet with us on this very busy day, a day that was a great success both for Russia and for yourself. I am extraordinarily happy to meet you because you introduced the flat tax into Russia. I tried to do the same thing in the USA but it did not work out for me.
Vladimir Putin: There is still a good option. You just need to be registered as a resident in Russia. That’s all.

Opening Address at the 10 th Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum
June 13, 2006
10:51
Saint Petersburg
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon dear colleagues, dear ladies and gentlemen!
I am glad to be able to welcome you to the 10 th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Every year the number of participants and guests of the Forum grows. The Forum is becoming more and more of a reference for experts, politicians, and for all those who are interested in the various ways to ensure social and economic development in Russia and in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Profound and substantial discussions on both the Russian and the global economy are taking place here.
The forum traditionally attracts visitors from the highest levels of government. And today I am very glad to be able to greet heads of state and of government taking part in this event. Thank you very much for coming here and being with us today.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Nobody doubts that Russia is an international leader as regards economic growth. The volume of GDP calculated at purchasing power parity exceeds one and a half trillion dollars. We do not require any more foreign loans. We are repaying our debts on time and even in advance payments. Moreover, this year the volume of gold and currency reserves can exceed the volume of the combined state and private external debts. In economic jargon this is referred to as the clearing balance and of course this attracts investments to our economy, both national and foreign investments. Foreign investors are coming to Russia with long-term plans. They are establishing new companies, creating jobs and introducing new technologies. And in 2005 for the first time in modern Russia’s history the inflow of private capital exceeded outflows.
Simultaneously Russian companies have become full participants in international cooperation and are already starting to invest their capital in major international projects. This is more than just an indicator of the competitiveness of our national companies; it is also proof of their profitability and aspirations to conform to international standards concerning management and transparency.
Meanwhile, being competitive on a global scale is impossible without establishing a competitive environment in Russia itself. We understand this perfectly and are creating all necessary conditions for developing entrepreneurship. These conditions include more effective cooperation between the public and private sectors.
I will point out that new possibilities have opened up for businessmen. I am referring to the special economic zones, concessions and other instruments that the Russian government is using and offering as a way to help business develop. First and foremost this concerns implementing projects in infrastructure. Here we are extraordinarily interested in consultations and in exchanging experiences with our colleagues from other countries and attracting them to work on Russian territory.
The exhibitions being held within this Forum are also helping achieve this. The Russian regions are also presenting their exhibits here and are showing off the large investment possibilities that exist.
I would like to emphasize that foreign investments in Russia, both direct and portfolio investments, now amount to 112 billion dollars. I hope that major corporations will continue to implement their projects in our country. And as Russia attracts foreign capital onto its market it will try to improve its business climate and create favourable conditions for cooperation.
In connection with this I would like to mention one theme which perhaps gives cause for concern. It is well-known that far from all countries, even developed ones, are able to create transparent procedures that allow foreign investors to enter their economy. This is often connected to the need to ensure national security. We are also looking for well-balanced approaches to resolve this difficult problem. And we think that first and foremost our economy must be absolutely open and transparent. And any restrictions for investors linked to ensuring our national security must be also as transparent as possible. It is important that no unreasonable barriers to the work of foreign investors be created under the auspices of ensuring national security.
And I hope that this will proceed the same way in other countries so that Russian investors do not face similar problems abroad. And that precise rules for making investments in strategic sectors will be established.
I would like to emphasize that our successes today constitute the basis for our future development. Of course a great deal of systematic problems remain unresolved within the Russian economy. I am referring to high inflation, monopolies in a number of sectors of the economy, bureaucratic obstacles and, unfortunately, corruption. However, I am confident that our economy’s steady growth and our perseverance in resolving the problems that stand before us will allow Russia to claim a worthy place in international division of labour.
It is well known that we have defined several priority sectors that already today have obvious advantages and preconditions for accelerated development. These sectors are energy, communications, the space sector, aviation, and the export of intellectual services. But the most important thing, and this is incontestable, lies in that special, unique capital that is neither machines, nor natural resources but simply the country’s citizens. It is them who are ensuring economic growth, developing natural resources, making complex mechanisms work and discovering new technologies.
Dear colleagues!
As you know part of the Forum’s agenda consists in looking for answers to the challenges posed by today’s global economic development. And it is obvious that is necessary to react to these challenges through joint efforts. First and foremost I am referring to the international financial system destabilization, overcoming serious discrepancies in the development of the richest and poorest countries and ensuring global security, including energy security. It is obvious that Russia is able to make an important contribution towards resolving these problems. Russia has already proven herself to be a responsible and reliable partner.
In conclusion I would like to say that as an active participant in building international procedures Russia intends to put forward its candidature to host the Universal Exposition in 2015.
When organizing Expo 2015 Russia can generate new ways to promote cooperation at the global level. We are ready for such work. And it is possible that we discuss these plans today. I want to wish you successful work and to thank the organizers and, once again, our guests.
Thank you very much for your attention.

Beginning of Meeting with President of Finland Tarja Halonen
June 13, 2006
21:30
St Petersburg
President Vladimir Putin: Mrs President,
Dear colleagues,
Allow me once again to wish you a warm welcome.
I am very pleased to see you this time in St Petersburg. I thank you for accepting this invitation and coming to the economic forum. It is always good promotion for any event when heads of state attend, and since this event is taking place in St Petersburg your presence here is all the more important because the special nature of relations between Finland and the Northwest of Russia has always been linked precisely to this city.
I am very pleased that the Russian Federation has taken first place among your trading partners. Practically every year we set new records for our trade growth. We work closely in the traditional sectors of energy and forestry, but there is also ever greater interest in cooperation on technology. Finland is a good partner for us in this respect given its level of technological development.
Finally, in just two weeks Finland will take over the presidency of the European Union and we very much hope that the good relations between Russia and Finland will be translated into good relations with the entire European Union.
President of Finland Tarja Halonen: ( translated from Russian) Mr President,
Thank you for your warm words. I agree entirely that relations between Finland and Russia are developing very well. This is true of our economic relations and our ties in other areas. I can say quite frankly that for many Finns, for Finnish people and Finnish companies, St Petersburg is the city that first comes to mind when they think of Russia. In this sense, our discussions on regional cooperation are certainly to our benefit.
I would also like to congratulate you on the [Russia-EU] summit in Sochi. It will be easy and pleasant now for our country to take over the EU presidency. This goes for relations with Russia and for the Northern Dimension. These relations are developing very favourably and the summit was a success in this respect.
Of course, it is very good for us that there is such a positive climate for our relations because there is a lot to do during Finland’s presidency of the European Union. This concerns renewing the Northern Dimension and promoting concrete cooperation between the European Union and Russia in general. We hope, of course, that the good start will lead to good results.
The economic forum that is taking place today here in St Petersburg is good advertising, including for the Northern Dimension. Holding this kind of event is proof that this part of Europe is growing fast and is attracting interest. I hope that our discussions will give us the chance to look in more detail at some specific aspects of our cooperation.

Beginning of the Meeting with the CEO of Nissan Motor, Carlos Ghosn
June 13, 2006
00:00
Saint Petersburg
Carlos Ghosn: (back translation) Thank you for your hospitality, Mr President. I want to say that thanks to all the very kind people we met here in Russia, we were able to make our investments.
I would just like to ask one question. We are investing – Nissan is at the head of the list of investors in Saint Petersburg – and we are also going to increase our investments in Moscow in Avtoframos. As promised, we had discussions with Avtovaz. We carried out a great deal of research, 40 of our experts visited Avtovaz and spent a substantial amount of time there. My question is very simple and short: will you support Avtovaz’s cooperation with other companies?
Vladimir Putin: First of all I would like to say that I support your decision to start assembling production in St Petersburg. Nissan is famous throughout the world. I know that our government offered you 11 possible places to start business in Russia and you chose St Petersburg. This is very pleasant for me because the municipal authorities are doing a great deal so that their partners make similar such decisions. Including in this case where, as far as I know, the Governor made the decision to invest almost 500 million rubles in infrastructure to facilitate your work. I hope that your work in Russia will be successful.
Regarding other projects, then I hope that the development of Avtoframos in Moscow will help solve a lot of problems and that the quantity of vehicles produced will increase. Certainly we shall support plans to expand your activities, including with respect to Avtovaz, if your Russian partners are interested in this work and if you agree with them on all aspects of cooperation.
I know that today with the Russian government’s support positive changes are taking place within Avtovaz, changes that are first and foremost connected with putting accounting in order and creating normal conditions of production. And this by itself results from governmental support. It is as though we are clearing a platform, creating conditions for normal, civilized, teamwork. And undoubtedly companies are interested in the inflow of fresh ideas, fresh professional management as well as development prospects and promising models.
We would like the company’s work to be as transparent and as modern as possible. And this would meet the requirements of today’s market conditions.

Beginning of the Meeting with the CEO of General Motors, Richard Wagoner
June 13, 2006
00:00
Saint Petersburg
Vladimir Putin: First of all I want to congratulate you on your decision to start producing in Russia. I want to congratulate you on today’s celebration connected with laying the first stone in what will become your factory.
Valentina Matvienko: We worked together with shovels.
Vladimir Putin: It doesn’t look like you worked with shovels.
Richard Wagoner: (back translation) We tried very hard.
Vladimir Putin: In any event, to be able to make that symbolic gesture with shovels you had to do a great deal of preparation. And you engaged in fundamental, productive and constructive work. I want to say that we see how international automobile companies are paying more attention to Russia and to the northwestern part of the country. And I believe that this is not by chance. Here there is a port, well-developed infrastructure, qualified personnel and the municipal authorities want to work together and to provide assistance. The arrival of your company, General Motors, is a good sign for future Russian-American relations, for the future development of our economic cooperation. We value this and you should have no doubts that we will do everything we can to promote the development of the project that you started today.
I know that President Bush is paying a great deal of attention to this. Some time ago he met with representatives from the Russian business community. I am confident that this will be one of the themes in our meeting tomorrow and during the G8 summit in St Petersburg.
Richard Wagoner: First, please let me thank you for taking the time to meet with us. I understand that you have a very intense schedule today. For us this is a really important and festive day because we declared that we will start producing from nothing. This implies that one hundred percent of the production will take place here. I am confident that Mr Putin knows that we have production units in many countries and therefore we are able to compare how easy it is to work with local or federal governments in a given country. And I would especially like to thank the Governor and the Ministry [of Economic Development and Trade] because with their help and with your support work proceeded very quickly and we were able to get this project under way. Today at the press conference I saw how the Governor works, how she can control a situation and make the correct decisions. I was convinced that she can oversee the project to its completion, something that I value very highly.
I wanted to draw your attention to what you said today because this is something that should be repeated from our side. The significant economic growth and the corresponding opportunities are very attractive to us. And this is yet one more source of support among those you heard at our meeting with the heads of companies. People really want to invest in Russia and are ready to do so because they see steady growth here.
Vladimir Putin: How much are you planning to invest in St Petersburg?
Richard Wagoner: In the first stages we plan to produce 25 thousand machines per year. This year we plan to sell 100 thousand machines. So we hope this will be a step towards further developing production. By the way, in addition to increasing our assembly production one of the areas in which we see excellent prospects is increasing our supply base. This is where we see our business’ future.
Vladimir Putin: How would you evaluate agreements with the government concerning locating this enterprise in all its separate components in Russia?
Richard Wagoner: Until now our suppliers were basically foreign suppliers whereas just a few of them were national ones. But we see significant prospects linked to increasing the number of national suppliers. It is for this reason that we can see that this project has a lot of potential to grow. The development of different technical schools, training engineering personnel, increasing research and development – I see interesting prospects in all these fields.
If I could just mention one more topic, and please excuse me because I know how busy you are today, I would like to emphasize that the new manufacturing plant that we are opening should be seen as an addition to a joint venture [with Avtovaz] that is already operational. So I wanted to talk about this separately. It is an additional project. From General Motors’ point of view the joint venture is a very successful joint project. And for our part we are ready and interested to continue working on and investing in this project.

Saint Petersburg
Vladimir Putin: I hope that the discussion that this developing here will be of interest to you. You yourself presented what I think is quite an interesting vision of our present relations and the prospects our relations have for developing in the future – something that is very attractive and valuable.
Despite certain difficulties relations are developing and you were absolutely right when you said that many possibilities exist and that there is a mutual interest in developing these possibilities. I think that we have expressed this interest more than once. I hope that we will be able to leave all difficulties behind us and think about the future.
