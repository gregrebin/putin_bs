Later today, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko will take part in a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State of Russia and Belarus.
: Mr Putin, Mr Medvedev, friends,
Mr Lukashenko, you were there at the very start of this process. I would like to thank you for this, because it was thanks to you and Boris Yeltsin that the process was launched, and, I repeat, we are now able to make new steps in developing our special relationship. I am certain that our work today will serve as an impetus for this positive process that is of such importance for our countries and peoples.
