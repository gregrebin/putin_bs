New Year's Address to the Nation.
President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev:
Citizens of Russia,
Friends,
In a few moments the Kremlin tower chimes will strike and we will wish each other a Happy New Year. Now a festive mood and a very special atmosphere reign in every home across the country.
By tradition, we use these moments to bid farewell to the outgoing year. It was not an easy year but its outcome for our country has been positive. This is the result of our joint efforts, and what next year will bring also depends on us.
Exactly 20 years ago we celebrated our first New Year in a country called Russia – a name celebrated for the illustrious deeds of our great ancestors, who over the centuries built up a huge and very strong power, a great country. It is our duty to preserve it and to build a progressive state, where all of us can live comfortably and do stimulating work.
”It is our duty to preserve it and to build a progressive state, where all of us can live comfortably and do stimulating work.“
Yes, we are all different, but this is precisely where our strength lies, as well as in our ability to hear, understand and respect each other, to tackle challenges together and achieve success.
Dear friends,
The New Year is approaching. It’s time to open the champagne and make our wishes. Tonight I wish health and prosperity to you and your loved ones, for your lives to be full of love and all your dreams to come true.
Believe in yourself, and I believe in each one of you. We will succeed!
Happiness to all of you!
Happy Holiday! Happy New Year 2012!
