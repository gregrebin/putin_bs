President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Today we are signing the General Agreement between national associations of trade unions, national associations of employers, and the Russian Federation Government. This document sets forth basic principles governing social and labour relations for the next three years and directly concerns the interests of over 70 million Russian citizens employed in various economic sectors.
I would like to thank the Tripartite Commission for Regulating Social and Labour Relations for its effective work in preparing the general agreement and for its active participation in solving issues of significance for the labour market.
At the signing ceremony for the General Agreement between national associations of trade unions, national associations of employers, and the Russian Federation Government for 2018–2020.
Today the recession period for the national economy is over, and in several sectors, including industry and agriculture, we can see growth, and we face the common goal of providing long-term sustainable growth and placing the economy in general on a positive trajectory and, as a matter of principle, boosting the real wages of our citizens.
We must remember that economic achievements do not come of themselves but are the result of people’s labour. Economic efficiency and increased competitiveness undoubtedly depend on good working conditions, enhanced productivity, modern technology and equipment, as well as the improvement of human capital, which is becoming an increasingly important factor.
Workers must have an opportunity to fully realise their potential through their work, to apply their knowledge, skills and experience profitably and productively, to enhance their professional skills and have an opportunity to advance, and to learn new competencies needed in their field promptly or, better still, proactively. At the same time, everyone must feel protected in terms of social guarantees, security and labour safety, and must also receive fair pay for their work.
I would like to remind you that it has been decided to equalise the minimum monthly wage and the subsistence wage, which is 11,163 rubles, on May 1. This decision has been taken largely at the prompting of our leading trade union association. Mr Shmakov and I met to discuss this issue. As you can see, we are implementing it.
At the signing ceremony for the General Agreement between national associations of trade unions, national associations of employers, and the Russian Federation Government for 2018–2020.
I hope that our colleagues in the State Duma will promptly adopt the necessary amendments to legislation. As I said, we must ensure the growth of real incomes and real wages for our people. This concerns both the public sector, where the government has been working consistently to attain this goal, and the commercial sector, because the competitiveness of our companies and their sustainable and forward-looking development depend directly on the creation of conditions for the workers’ self-fulfilment and on investment in their education, health, competencies and the quality of their life.
Enhancing economic efficiency through the development of labour potential is a comprehensive task that calls for a close interaction of society, business and the state and their readiness to balance their interests. I hope that the new General Agreement will provide a reference point for finding this balance, and that the implementation of this agreement by all parties, including the employers, the trade unions and the Government, will provide a positive example of a reliable social partnership.
In conclusion, I would like to thank you again for your hard work in the best interests of the country and the national economy.
Signing ceremony for the General Agreement between national associations of trade unions, national associations of employers, and the Russian Federation Government for 2018–2020.
Thank you very much.
(The parties sign the General Agreement.)
Chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia Mikhail Shmakov: Mr President, colleagues,
There is no doubt that the signing of the trilateral three-year agreement today is an important milestone in our efforts to promote social partnership in the country. I would like to highlight the President’s words when he said that this critical political decision, and also economic, of course, was years in the making. As early as on May 1, the minimum monthly wage will be equated to the subsistence wage, which is clearly a major step toward eliminating poverty. I strongly believe that the objectives that are set today, whereby by early 2020s an employed person will not live in poverty, can be achieved.
I would also like to say that as we develop the social partnership proactively, it would be desirable to have all three parties represented within social insurance funds. It is for this reason that both the employers’ associations and trade unions are represented in the Social Insurance Fund, while this is not the case for the Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund or the Pension Fund. I think that this can be done within the next three years.
Chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia Mikhail Shmakov.
Thank you, Mr President for lending your active support to the joint trilateral work.
President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin: Mr President, thank you for highlighting the importance of social partnership by attending the signing ceremony. I think that your presence here can be viewed not just as a sign of respect for the parties involved in the social partnership initiative, but also as proof of its effectiveness.
As you have justly emphasised, one of the main objectives of the social partnership between the Government, the employers and trade unions is to ensure that the Russian economy is competitive, and that Russia is competitive not just as an economy, but also as a jurisdiction and as a state, that its workers and people are competitive. We are working on it. I hope that the new three-year general agreement reflects the parties’ commitment to move in this direction.
I would like to say that social partners are ready not only to sit on the managing bodies of social funds but also to assume responsibility for the management of these funds. For example, [the management of] the Social Insurance Fund could be turned over to social partners, so that the Fund would operate on the principles of social insurance or social partnership.
We have reached many compromises during our discussions of a new general agreement. We have reached a new level in coordinating our actions. One of such coordinated decisions is an agreement on the need to recognise the companies’ social investments in the interest of regions, municipalities, workers and the state as a whole.
President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin.
In particular, we believe that the companies’ social investments should be given more attention in terms of taxation. Taxes are often based on the companies’ net profits. It is not very easy for the municipal authorities to finance the construction of schools, outpatient clinics or stadiums. We have formulated proposals on ways to find a compromise in this sphere, including with the tax and budget systems.
In other words, there are many examples of forward movement in the mutual recognition of our interests, and they are reflected in the General Agreement.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, this is what I would like to say in conclusion.
I know how difficult this job is and that it is always accompanied by debates, which are based on considerations of principle and are often heated. This is what I want to say in this connection. I am very pleased to see that you were working towards a common result in a highly responsible way, despite any differences in the process of searching for compromises, and that you knew you needed to balance your interests for the benefit of the nation. Both the trade unions, which represent the interests of workers, the business representatives and, of course, the Government respect and listen to each other. This is the only way to find the necessary solutions.
I would like to thank you for doing this and to congratulate you on the results achieved. Thank you.

Event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of siege of Leningrad
Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu took part in the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.

At the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu attended the presentation of the new Russian feature film Sobibor. Konstantin Khabensky’s film describes the uprising in a Nazi concentration camp in 1943 and the feat accomplished by Soviet officer Alexander Pechersky.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
During these days the entire world remembers the victims of the Holocaust. On January 27, 1945 Soviet soldiers freed the prisoners of Auschwitz. By decision of the United Nations this day has become an eternal reminder of the atrocities committed by the Nazis and their heinous crimes that cannot be justified or forgiven. This day has embodied our common memory and grief.
It is deeply symbolic that Prime Minister of the State of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu is here with us today in Moscow. Thank you very much for being with us today.
At the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.
Our memory is a warning against any attempt to jump on the idea of global domination, to announce, build or assert one’s grandeur based on racism, ethnic or any other supremacy. Russia categorically rejects any such attempt. The history of the 20th century shows to what extent the consequences of such essentially anti-human ideology can lead.
The purposeful and mass extermination of people that the Nazis put on an assembly line does not stop horrifying us today. Needless to say, this was hell on Earth. No matter how many years pass, it is impossible to comprehend the dismal scale of these atrocities.
According to the documents of the Nuremberg Trials, the Nazi machine of destruction killed 6 million Jews. There were hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens among them. About 3 million Soviet prisoners of war perished in extermination camps. People of very different ages and ethnic origins were tortured, burned and mutilated. We mourn all victims, all those who gave up their lives to free the world from the Nazis, their barbarity and depredations. We will always remember the road to the Great Victory and will tell the next generations the full truth about these heroes.
This year marks 75 years since the Sobibor concentration camp uprising, which went down in history as the most massive act of prisoner resistance. The courage and strength of the people who opposed the enemy practically with bare hands, and the unbending will of the uprising leader, the Soviet lieutenant Alexander Pechersky, are stunning. This cannot but cause admiration and amazement. These people defended their right to life. Defying death, they fought for freedom and human dignity. Doomed, but not broken, they won in the end.
At the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.
The Nazis created about 40,000 camps and ghettos in Europe. Children, old people, women, and physically and mentally challenged people were subjected to terror and ruthless violence. However, they did not give up. They organised underground resistance, planned escapes, resisted, and, until the last breath, remained faithful to their convictions and values, which the Nazis sought to destroy.
The fight against Nazism was waged not only on the fronts, but in the hearts and minds of millions of people. In this fight, the Nazis lost long before their total military defeat.
Strength of will and faith in victory helped the residents of heroic Leningrad survive, too. In January, we marked two anniversaries: the lifting of the siege and the full liberation of the city. Leningrad residents survived 900 tragic days. Like the victims of the Holocaust, they faced down death, suffering, and loss. Theirs is one of the most outstanding and striking mass feats of a people. We honour their fortitude. Their pain is still felt in our hearts.

Conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
January 29, 2018
The Soviet Union bore the brunt of the Nazi blow, as was just mentioned here. People of different ethnic backgrounds fought against the enemy shoulder to shoulder. Their dedication and unity inspired the world and roused it to fight Nazism.
Thanks to their solidarity, the Soviet people won a great victory. Today, interreligious, interethnic unity is the basis of our statehood. Zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, or any manifestations of xenophobia and ethnic strife bring Russia and Israel closer. We closely cooperate, including in countering attempts to falsify history, to revise the outcomes of World War II, to deny the Holocaust, or to belittle the decisive contribution of the Soviet Union to victory over Nazi Germany. Such attempts must be put down swiftly.
We know that Israel carefully maintains gratitude to the Soviet Army and our soldiers for saving Jews and Europe from total extermination. Of course, we appreciate the fact that a monument is planned in Jerusalem in honour of the feat of the defenders and residents of besieged Leningrad.
I remember going to the opening of the monument to the Red Army soldiers. It was a very touching event. We are grateful to the leadership of Israel and the people of Israel for their respect for history.
This is especially important amid the destruction and desecration of monuments to Soviet soldiers who gave their lives to liberate prisoners of Nazi concentration camps, and save Europe and the entire world from Nazism.
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu at the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.
I am convinced that modern politicians, religious and public figures must do their utmost to preserve historical memory in the 21st century and to prevent the weeds of nationalist ideology, whatever forms it may take – anti-Semitism, Russophobia, or any other phobia rooted in hatred – from ever sprouting.
Our common duty is to protect the values of peace and humanism and the most important value – human life – against any and all threats that arise.
Thank you.
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu
: (retranslated): Mr President of Russia Vladimir Putin. Guests that are attending this event. Rabbis. The families that have survived World War II, that have survived the Holocaust.
My friend, Mr President, I would like to thank you for the invitation to visit this impressive Jewish Museum and Tolerance Centre. I must add that I know this museum would not have been established without your assistance. I was very excited to see the description of the history of our nation in Russia, including the current period when Jewish life in Russia is thriving, largely owing to the support of the authorities and your personal support.
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu at the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.
This museum describes the sad pages in the history of our nation, primarily the Holocaust. The Holocaust is a horrible tragedy in the history of the human race. It proved what you said a few minutes ago. I would like to emphasise that. If a limitless hatred of Jews is not curbed, it will spread quickly and could destroy other nations as well.
A third of the Jewish people were annihilated with monstrous cruelty during the Holocaust. It is necessary to add to this number the tens of thousands of people who were mainly killed here in Russia. Our common task is to counter such extreme ideologies when they are still small, fight them when they are still weak and do it in time and in full-force. Our task is to enhance the struggle against anti-Semitism, to be tough in countering all manifestations of anti-Semitism together in the name of our common future.
You mentioned the importance of adhering to the truth. Being truthful about our past is an indispensable condition for assuming responsibility for our future. First of all, this is an issue of justice, justice for the victims (I say this for those who try to deny the Holocaust), and justice for those who fought, were wounded or perished to stop the Nazi threat.
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu at the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.
We never forget the role played by the Soviet Army in this victory. Mr President, we see the truth in this museum. Today we recall our brothers and sisters who were brutally murdered by the Nazis. Today we salute the soldiers of the Soviet Army, including hundreds of thousands of Jews who were justifiably awarded medals for the heroism they displayed. Together with other soldiers they stopped the Nazi war machine.
You mentioned a monument in Israel. I initiated the creation of this monument in Netanya some time ago as a symbol of deep gratitude which we consider important to express not only here, on Russian land, but also on our land in Israel. You took part in the opening of this monument. Unfortunately, if you recall, I was unable to attend due to a broken leg. However, I am confident that we will both attend the opening of the next such monument.
Recently, our parliament adopted a special law that established a special status of May 9 as Victory Day over Nazi Germany, as a special date on the Israeli calendar.
Presentation of the new Russian feature film “Sobibor” as part of the event devoted to International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the anniversary of the complete lifting of the Nazi siege of Leningrad.
Today, I salute Commander Alexander Pechersky, a Jew, a Soviet Army officer, who led the Sobibor camp uprising. I wondered how they did it, since there were dozens of Nazi officers and hundreds of guards. It started with what you mentioned here – he was not willing to give up. Against all odds, he and his friends, his brothers-in-arms were able to overcome the Nazi guards and break through to freedom. Unfortunately, most of them did not survive. Pechersky survived, but he was prepared to die.
It appears that this uprising against the Nazis at the bottom of the abyss in which our people found themselves, against all odds – there are those who, perhaps, thought that this would be the end of our history, but this uprising meant exactly the opposite. The enormous strength that exists in our people, which compels us not to give up, not to surrender to those who are trying to destroy us. This uprising, perhaps more than any other event, symbolises a profound pivot in the history of the Jewish people. From the deep abyss in which we were, from a people who could not protect themselves, we turned into a strong state that knows how to fight for itself, and which is capable of defending itself on its own. This is a revolution, a turning point, that is, perhaps, unique in the history of our people.
Our unwavering readiness to fight for ourselves and protect ourselves is an iron wall, a wall of steel that cannot be broken, and it will continue to protect us.

Mr President, I am willing to testify that among the world leaders there are few who understand it as well as you do. Seventy-five years after this hell, we are still determined to avert any attempts by such groups and ideologies. Primarily Iran, which openly states that it wants to destroy us. None of them will ever succeed. Neither terrorist regimes nor their envoys will ever be able to achieve that. However, it is important to understand that the danger that comes from them is a threat not only to us, but the entire world. We will confront them with all our might in order to safeguard eternal Israel and the future of humankind.
As we stand in this important museum, the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Centre, I would like to tell you something that is a hundred percent true: there will not be another Holocaust.
Thank you.

With Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, welcome once again.
Thank you for accepting the invitation. I am particularly thankful to you for agreeing to hold today's meeting here. It is symbolic, because these days the entire world is remembering the victims of the Holocaust.
As you are aware, our country was strongly affected, and almost every family lost someone. Among the Jews murdered by the Nazis, there were many citizens of the Soviet Union, Russia. They also made a vast contribution to the victory over the Nazis.
As usual, we will use this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations and the situation in the region.
Mr Prime Minister, we are very pleased to see you. Welcome!
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu
(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President,
I appreciate your invitation and the fact that you decided to personally attend this ceremony, at this place, on these days. This reflects our common fight against that terrible evil witnessed by humanity, and the enormous price paid by my people, the Jewish people, and the Russian people, in this fight. An enormous sacrifice – 20 million Russian lives and 6 million Jewish lives. The heroism of the Red Army which led to the defeat of Nazism.
The exhibition that we saw here, which is devoted to the uprising in the Sobibor death camp, had a strong impression on me. An uprising led by a Jew, a Red Army officer. He successfully led the uprising and the escape to freedom against all odds.
I believe that one of the main lessons of the history of the Nazis’ rise to power and their defeat is that it is necessary to stop such evil before it is too late. This is our goal today.
This is what I want to discuss with you today, as well as the events unfolding in the region, our common efforts, promoting security and stability in the region, and, of course, the expansion of bilateral relations between our two countries, Israel and Russia.
Our conversations and meetings, which we hold from time to time, undoubtedly do a lot for security and stability, and I am sure this will remain the case in the future.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
