Meeting with President of Finland Sauli Niinistö.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues,
We are very happy to see you in St Petersburg, this time during work on Arctic matters.
Finland now heads the Arctic Council and has accomplished a great deal in the past 18–24 months.
I would also like to note that our bilateral relations continue to develop steadily. We maintain contacts at the level of presidential executive offices, governments and parliaments. This has an impact on trade, which continues to grow.
We are always happy to have an opportunity to meet with you, talk and discuss all these matters.
President of Finland Sauli Niinistö
(retranslated): Thank you very much.
I am very happy to have this opportunity to take part in forum The Arctic: Territory of Dialogue for the third time. We had a very interesting conversation in Salekhard and Arkhangelsk. I believe that we will have the same today.
Thank you for your words regarding Finland’s presidency of the Arctic Council. I believe we have managed to make the Arctic region more prominent on the world map over these years. This is what we have worked for. I believe that the Arctic region is interesting for the entire world, and that dialogue conducted along these lines at the Arctic Council can serve as a model or example for other parts of the world. To my mind, Arctic Council discussions have always been very good.
Speaking of our bilateral relations, relations between our countries, they are neighbourly and positive.
Yesterday, I visited our Consulate General here in St Petersburg. This consulate issues the largest number of visas to Russian citizens of all our consulates. They also confirmed that, as compared to other Russian cities, St Petersburg receives the largest number of Finnish tourists. When I heard this, I recalled a statement you made several years ago when I said that many Russian tourists come to Helsinki and Finland. You expressed hope that they behaved well. I can probably make the same statement now: I hope that Finnish tourists also behave well.
Thank you for this opportunity.
Vladimir Putin: Everything is fine, the tourists behave normally, and they do not forget to eat something with their drinks, so everything is all right with them.
Sauli Niinistö (retranslated): This is as it should be.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam Prime Minister, colleagues,
Allow me to greet you once again, now in this format. First, I would like to thank you for accepting our invitation and coming to St Petersburg.
Today, we covered extensively the opportunities for cooperation and the threats associated with working in the Arctic. In this regard, I would like to remind you of the positive experiences of our cooperation, the most important of which include agreements on sections of the sea, on cooperation, as well as on activities in the Barents Sea and a portion of the Arctic Ocean. This is good for bilateral relations and for cooperation in the Arctic in general.
Next year marks the 115th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. As far as I know, this year also marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of northern Norway from the Nazis, and, to my knowledge, Norway will celebrate this date at a high level. We took note of this and appreciate it very much.
Trade is also growing, it was up by almost 14 percent last year.
We are very pleased to see you. Welcome.
Prime Minister of Norway Erna Solberg (retranslated): Thank you, President Putin.
We are pleased to take part in this international Arctic conference, the subject of which is closely related to Norway, namely, ocean conditions. We strongly appreciate the invitation to St Petersburg and the warm welcome that we, the Norwegian delegation, have received.
Indeed, primarily, our two countries cooperate in the north. We maintain neighbourly relations, and we face many common challenges. I hope we will be able to expand this theme-specific cooperation in the future.
Indeed, northern Norway is grateful to Russia for liberating East-Finnmark from the Nazi invaders. We will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the liberation in the autumn. We are pleased that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will come for this anniversary. Norway recognises the sacrifices the Soviet people made during liberation from the invaders. We are grateful to Russia for that.

Question from a media member: May I ask one question from Norway?
Vladimir Putin: Go ahead.
Question: Russia is accusing a Norwegian of spying. What needs to be done to resolve this?
Vladimir Putin: Take the time to see what the court has to say about it. As in any country, our courts establish the punishment, the liability, whether a person is guilty or not. It all depends on the court ruling. Once we have it, we will see what we can do about it.
Question: Are you willing to pardon him?
Vladimir Putin: You can only pardon someone who has been convicted. He has not been convicted yet.
