President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President. I am very happy to see you. You and I are meeting for the second time; our first meeting was in Sochi.
Eighty percent of South Ossetia’s citizens are also dual citizens of the Russian Federation, so we are certainly not indifferent to the situation unfolding in South Ossetia.
Today we have a very good opportunity to discuss how our plans, including joint ones, are being implemented – both our budgetary plans and those concerning investment projects.

I assume the situation in the region is changing somewhat. I hope it will change for the better and we will be able to build good relations with all our neighbours. I suggest we discuss all these matters today.
I am glad to see you. Welcome.
President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov: Mr President, first of all, please allow me to thank you for the invitation to come to the Russian Federation on an official visit. I will also take this opportunity to express my people’s sincere gratitude to you for your support of our republic and our people.
The people of South Ossetia remember the important decisions made in August 2008. Those decisions, as well as the establishment of diplomatic ties, became steps, milestones in the history of the Ossetian people and in the history of Ossetian-Russian relations, which truly have serious historic roots.
Today, our people are set on working constructively and we are maintaining that positive attitude thanks to your support, the support of the Russian Federation. I assure you that this positive attitude will remain and all the challenges before our people will be resolved, and the help granted by Russia will be delivered and will reach every individual, every family.
It is a great honour for me to be here. We are meeting for the second time and I think we really will have enough time to discuss the issues that have accumulated and await our decision-making. And I thank you for this. Thank you very much for finding the time to speak with me today about these matters.
