President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President. I am very happy to see you. You and I are meeting for the second time; our first meeting was in Sochi.
Eighty percent of South Ossetia’s citizens are also dual citizens of the Russian Federation, so we are certainly not indifferent to the situation unfolding in South Ossetia.
Today we have a very good opportunity to discuss how our plans, including joint ones, are being implemented – both our budgetary plans and those concerning investment projects.

I assume the situation in the region is changing somewhat. I hope it will change for the better and we will be able to build good relations with all our neighbours. I suggest we discuss all these matters today.
I am glad to see you. Welcome.
President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov: Mr President, first of all, please allow me to thank you for the invitation to come to the Russian Federation on an official visit. I will also take this opportunity to express my people’s sincere gratitude to you for your support of our republic and our people.
The people of South Ossetia remember the important decisions made in August 2008. Those decisions, as well as the establishment of diplomatic ties, became steps, milestones in the history of the Ossetian people and in the history of Ossetian-Russian relations, which truly have serious historic roots.
Today, our people are set on working constructively and we are maintaining that positive attitude thanks to your support, the support of the Russian Federation. I assure you that this positive attitude will remain and all the challenges before our people will be resolved, and the help granted by Russia will be delivered and will reach every individual, every family.
It is a great honour for me to be here. We are meeting for the second time and I think we really will have enough time to discuss the issues that have accumulated and await our decision-making. And I thank you for this. Thank you very much for finding the time to speak with me today about these matters.

During our conversation, we discussed nearly every aspect of Russian-South Ossetian relations. I should stress right away that Russia intends to continue providing the necessary support to South Ossetia in strengthening its statehood and resolving highly important economic and social challenges.
As before, we will continue to promote fostering conditions for raising living standards through the creation of new jobs and the rebuilding of the republic’s infrastructure. For us, this is a matter of principle; after all, nearly 80 percent of the people living in that country have dual citizenship, both South Ossetian and Russian with Russia.
Overall, the full set of social issues – including education, healthcare, and the provision of pensions – requires our joint efforts, and we spoke about this in quite a bit of detail, identifying specific plans for joint work.
It is important that cooperation between Russia and South Ossetia is becoming increasingly systemic. We are continuing to improve our international treaty framework. The agreement signed by the Transport Ministry on interstate road transportations is a basis for expanding freight and passenger transit between our countries and greatly simplifies cargo customs registration procedures and entry into Russia.
We and our colleagues gave particular attention to issues of ensuring regional security and stability.
In conclusion, I would like to thank you, Mr President, and all our colleagues for the deep, serious work that was done today and the atmosphere of mutual understanding, as well as the determination to reach visible results in our cooperation.
Thank you very much.
President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov
: Thank you.
Mr Putin, colleagues,
We have just concluded our meeting at the highest level. This meeting has enormous political significance to the entire people of South Ossetia. This was my second meeting at this level.
Our last meeting, held in May of this year, contributed to advancing the entire spectrum of relations between South Ossetia and Russia. Today we see that the agreements reached back in May are being implemented.
Today’s meeting was very important. We discussed a range of issues of vital significance for the Republic of South Ossetia. We discussed economic matters and very thoroughly focused on the investment programme, which includes prospects for South Ossetia’s development.
We agreed that this investment programme will be implemented in 2013–2015. I believe that once the programme is accomplished, the people of South Ossetia will feel the positive changes.
I am grateful to Mr Putin, Russia’s leaders and all the people of Russia for the assistance that they have always provided and continue to provide to South Ossetia and its people.
For our part, we know that the extensive aid coming from Russia will be rightly directed toward its intended recipients and that the life of every individual and every family will soon improve.
We have always followed the legacy of our ancestors who declared friendship with Russia for all times. This fundamental principle will always be followed. The positive attitude within the republic’s leadership and among the people will be preserved in order to address various issues of our bilateral relations.
Mr Putin, I want to once again sincerely thank you, and on behalf of our delegation and our people I want to take this opportunity to invite you to visit our republic at a time that is convenient for you. I believe that this would be an event that would be impossible to compare with anything else. So we are asking you to come and see how our people are living, even though you certainly have sufficient information on the subject, and to see the changes brought about by the new leadership of the Republic.
Thank you very much, everyone. We hope for success in the development of our relations.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
