The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Welcome children,
Happy New Year to all of you!
I was very glad to hear that children from all over Russia had come here today.
I would like to congratulate everyone who won the right to be at this party in Moscow today, by winning competitions. In the days before New Year’s Eve, it is a present to be in Moscow and I congratulate you all.
In general, I must say that we live in quite a difficult but interesting world, and at a very interesting time. And I would like to express my wish that you find your own place, your own occupation in life and that you become the best in your place and your chosen area.
This is a holiday of hope. It is a holiday of expectations. The symbol of New Year’s Eve is the fir tree. It embodies life and youth. And I hope that you find under this tree of life everything that you want and that good luck accompanies you in the future.
I wish you every happiness!
Happy New Year!
