Beginning of meeting with President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am happy to welcome you to Moscow. Thank you for finding the time during your international tour to respond to our invitation to visit Russia.
Before we discuss global energy matters, I would like to note that Venezuela is not only a good friend, but also a very close partner, one of our leading partners in Latin America. Therefore, I am very happy to have this opportunity to discuss our bilateral relations as well, including both current matters and major large-scale projects.
We are very happy to see you here. Welcome!
President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro
(retranslated): We are also very happy to have the opportunity to visit you once again, Mr Putin. Last time we met in Brazil; that was six months ago during a meeting of Latin American states with the BRICS
states.
This time we have come to discuss issues pertaining to our bilateral relations and the stabilisation on the markets of natural resources. These issues are very important for our relations – issues of relations between Russia and Venezuela, between Russia and other Latin American countries.
We would like to reiterate our solidarity with the Russian people and our deep faith in your ability to work, faith that you will be able to handle this situation and move forward.
Venezuela will always be with Russia.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you.
