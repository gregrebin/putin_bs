The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin: Dear Mr President, dear colleagues, dear friends!
Allow me to warmly welcome you to Moscow once again.
I wish to point out that recently relations between our countries are developing very intensively. The volume of trade is growing. We are finding new fields in which to cooperate, including in high-tech. We are managing to coordinate our activities in the international arena and acting together to counteract today's threats in the most effective way.
We see Brazil as our most promising partner in Latin America and as a country with huge potential. We are very glad to welcome the President of Brazil and such a representative group of friends to the Russian Federation's capital.
Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva (translated from Russian): President Putin, ministers of Russia and Brazil!
I wish to say that this visit to Russia is a very pleasant event for me. I consider that there are excellent opportunities for further developing Russian-Brazilian relations. First, because we are not divided by historical disputes. Indeed, there are no disputes between us at the present. And because I believe that, due to our developing economies, we can achieve a lot through joint efforts. I have asked my ministers to construct an effective policy regarding international trade relations as if they were a two-way street. Brazil wishes to sell, but it must buy as well. Brazil wants foreign enterprises to invest there. In turn, we must convince our entrepreneurs that they must invest in other countries' economies.
