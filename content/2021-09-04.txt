President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, friends,
Once again, please accept my congratulations on receiving state decorations. This is a case where we can say your service is difficult and dangerous – and it is noble as well. You are deservedly called rescuers: this word conveys the essence of your work.
I have visited many such locations and have seen the situations you have to deal with constantly. But I came and I left – while you have to work with people, and I know how hard it is, both physically and emotionally. You have to experience it all, and this is what your life is about.
On behalf of all those you help and rescue, I would like to thank you with all my heart for your service and your work. You have your own families, children and loved ones. I am sure you would not have it any other way: you live in the moment, the moment and focus on those who await your help.
I am aware of how difficult it is to face other people’s pain and suffering. But you give them a helping hand and support them, sometimes putting your own lives at risk. Sadly, it happens that people sacrifice their own lives to save others, and there is nothing more noble than that.
Thank you very much for your hard work. I wish you all the best.
