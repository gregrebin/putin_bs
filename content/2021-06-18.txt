There are a number of routine matters that we need to discuss, and several current issues.
But I suggest we start by analysing the results of my Geneva meeting with the President of the United States. In this regard, I would ask Mr Sergei Lavrov to begin our discussion today.
Go ahead, please, Mr Lavrov.
