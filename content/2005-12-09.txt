President Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, dear colleagues,
It is our tradition to meet before the Day of the Russian Constitution. This year, we will be marking the twelfth anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution in a national referendum. This is a big event in our country’s life. I would like to thank you for the Constitutional Court’s work in acting within its powers to strengthen Russian statehood and reinforce the constitutional regime in our country.
The Constitutional Court plays a very important part in our country’s life, despite the fact that it is does not directly examine criminal cases or commercial disputes. But as a body that has the power to interpret and evaluate the law, the court, both directly and indirectly, defends the interests of Russia’s citizens, and this is a very important function.
The court, in also having the power to initiate legislation and to interpret the law, participates directly and indirectly in the legislative process. The influence the Constitutional Court has on the legislators is visible and is of great significance.
Then there are also the Constitutional Court’s international activities. I know, for example, that an event is currently taking place in Moscow with the participation of the European Court of Human Rights. The implementation of the provisions of international law and the application of basic legal norms in Russia give particular significance to the Constitutional Court’s decisions and to our entire legal system, which is without question a part of the European legal system. All of this gives me reason for repeating the words I began with: I would like to thank you once again for our work together and wish you continued success.
