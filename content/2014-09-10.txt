Meeting with Government members.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, colleagues.
We will be talking about a matter I spent four hours discussing last night with several colleagues, namely, drafting the budget (the Government is already at the final phase of this major work); but before we touch on these main topics, a few words about my trip to the Far East.
The colleagues who participated in individual elements of our joint work know this, but I would nevertheless like to draw attention to one of the major national construction projects: the Vostochny Space Launch Centre.
Then I would like to hear from Accounts Chamber Chairman Tatyana Golikova
about the most serious issue pertaining to resettlement from dilapidated housing located in the Baikal Amur Railway zone. This work is being conducted as part of the Housing Development Federal Targeted Programme. Following my instructions, Ms Golikova has carried out the audits and I would like to hear about what you found there and how it appears from your department’s point of view.
And another issue. I would like to ask Mr Ulyukayev
, the Economic Development Minister, to brief all of us on how the work with the European Commission and our Ukrainian partners is progressing with regard to Ukraine’s upcoming ratification of its Association Agreement with the European Union, as well as what we achieved as a result of preliminary consultations, bearing in mind that in just two days, on September 12, the talks will be held at the ministerial level. Naturally, we are all awaiting your report on what agreements have been reached at this point in time.
