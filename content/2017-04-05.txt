Speeches at state dinner hosted by Vladimir Putin in honour of President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Mirziyoyev,
Friends and colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
Let me start by noting that this, your first visit to Russia, has the highest status of a state visit.
We see and value the attention that you have given to our bilateral relations since your first days in office as President of Uzbekistan. It is no exaggeration to say that these relations really do have a particular nature of friendship, partnership and alliance.
Our multifaceted bilateral cooperation is cemented by our long centuries of common history and rich traditions, traditions of mutual understanding, cooperation, support, and the invaluable capital of cultural, spiritual and human ties.
I particularly positively assess the results of our talks today. We worked effectively, productively, reached some important agreements, and outlined long-term plans for cooperation in the economy, humanitarian ties, and on ensuring security and stability in Central Asia.
The Joint Statement we signed today reflects our common desire to continue developing bilateral ties on the principles of good-neighbourliness, strategic partnership and alliance.
I know that the Uzbek people have a good proverb: “Join together and succeed. Stand alone and fail.” It is very important that Russia and Uzbekistan work together, in cooperation, and always understand each other. I am sure that if we join our efforts, we can achieve even the most difficult and ambitious goals.
Let me propose a toast to strengthening our friendship and alliance, and to partnership and cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan, a toast to the prosperity and well-being of our peoples, and to your health, Mr President, and the health of all present.
Sog-buling! (‘Good health to you!’ in Uzbek)
President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev
: Mr Putin, friends,
I would like to express my sincere gratitude for this warm reception and for the hospitality we always find here on Russian soil.
I am very grateful to you, Mr Putin, for the warm words you addressed to Uzbekistan and our people. Russia has always been for us a reliable strategic partner and ally, tested by time. We never forget our common history and interests, and the deep spiritual and moral roots that unite us. As the outstanding scholar, Academician Dmitry Likhachev, said, memory is the foundation of conscience and morality, and of culture, and preserving memory is our moral duty before ourselves and future generations.
We are sincerely happy to see Russia’s confident and steady development and its growing influence on the international stage. This is certainly in large part the result of President Putin’s far-sighted and pragmatic policy. Let me say that Uzbekistan’s people has profound respect for the great Russian people and for their rich culture, art, traditions, and the generosity and goodness of the Russian character.
Today, close to a million ethnic Russians live and work on Uzbekistan’s fertile soil, make a worthy contribution to our country’s development, and consider Uzbekistan their home. I am sure that this visit will help to continue expanding and strengthening the strategic partnership and alliance between Uzbekistan and Russia for the good of our countries and peoples.
I propose a toast to the health of President of Russia Vladimir Putin, to our peoples’ prosperity and well-being, and to the health of all present.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,
Today, you are not simply taking part in the latest of your working meetings, but are marking an anniversary of sorts, as it was 25 years ago that the CIS agreement on cooperation between the security and intelligence agencies in important areas was signed.
This legal base was subsequently strengthened with other agreements in various areas. At any rate, over these years, our countries have established excellent cooperation on the main challenges.
To our regret, we see that the situation has not improved. This is clear in the latest tragic event in St Petersburg, where a terrorist attack killed people and caused many victims.
We know that nearly all of our countries could become potential targets for terrorists. Our countries face many other threats too, including organised crime and drug trafficking, corruption, and the impact of forces acting from outside and attempting in one way or another to influence internal political developments in our countries.
We have very complicated and diverse tasks before us, but I am very pleased to see that our cooperation is well established and developing effectively.
It is a great pleasure to see you all here in Moscow and I wish you welcome. I hope that, as top-class professionals, you understand the importance of your work together and will do everything to ensure that it continues in this spirit.
Welcome!
<…>
